> Undeterred by the high price tag, home seekers rushed for the five-room Build-To-Order (BTO) flats in Toa Payoh (Bidadari) – the most expensive units in this month's sales launch.

> As of 5pm yesterday, each of the 144 five-room flats in Bartley Beacon had more than six first-time applicants vying for the unit.

> Second-time applicants face an even bleaker prospect, with more than 152 applicants vying for each five-roomer.

> Prices for these flats, the largest flat types in the Bidadari estate project, range from $627,000 to $726,000, excluding grants.

> The last time new BTO flats were launched in the Bidadari estate, which is classified under the Toa Payoh town, was in May 2017.

> Then, prices for the five-room flats in a project named Woodleigh Hillside started from $579,000, excluding grants.

> In this month's sales exercise, which concluded at midnight, the 910 four-room flats in Bartley Beacon and ParkView @ Bidadari were less popular, attracting around three first-time applicants for each unit.

> BETTER CHANCE

> On the other hand, first-time applicants for the 184 three-room flats in both projects stood a better chance at securing a flat as it attracted just slightly more applicants than the available units.

> Also in demand were the four-room flats in Bishan Ridges, with close to five first-time applicants vying for each of the 1,222 four-room flats.

> These flats, within walking distance of Bishan MRT station, were the second most expensive units in this launch, with prices ranging from $528,000 to $679,000.

> Bigger flats in the non-mature estate of Sembawang were also hotly contested, with more than four first-time applicants vying for each of the 184 five-room flats in the housing project named Sun Sails.

> The odds were slightly better for the 238 four-room flats and 84 three-room flats, with around three first-time applicants for each available unit.

> In Tengah, the first Housing Board new town in over 20 years, there were almost three first-time applicants for each of the 327 five-room flats and around two applicants for each of the 570 four-room flats. These flats are spread across two housing projects named Garden Court @ Tengah and Garden Terrace @ Tengah, and will be the first to be completed around the first quarter of 2024.

106,13,gdex8nx,t1_gdew6w5,"The Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) was introduced as a property cooling measure in 2013 to limit the amount that could be borrowed to finance a property, and refers to the maximum percentage of a person's gross monthly income that can be used to pay back all of that person's loans. 

Currently, the TDSR is set at 60%, i.e. the amount you need to pay back on all your loans combined must not exceed 60% of your salary.

Hdb buyers have to take note of the Mortgage servicing ratio, which is capped at 30%. 

What is Mortgage Servicing Ratio?

Mortgage Servicing Ratio, or MSR, is a limit imposed by the MAS on how much money you can borrow when you take out a loan to buy HDB property or an EC.

Under the MSR, a maximum of 30% of your gross monthly income can be used to repay your loan.

CPF accrual I think is extremely important. Its in essence a loan against yourself in perpetuity.  So you should do your planning 5 years, 10 years, 30 years on paper and see if you could tolerate a recession or a period where your income might not be as stable and it would be detrimental for you to sell off your HDB.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The new complex will occupy just 1.1ha of the 7.1ha previously occupied by the Mount Vernon Columbarium Complex.

> When completed, the new purpose-built complex will offer a ""holistic range of services"", said the agencies.

> It will house 12 funeral wake halls, shops selling flowers and funerary goods, as well as a seminar room. A food and beverage outlet will also be made easily accessible to members of the public, NEA and HDB said.

> There will be no columbarium or crematorium located within the complex, they added.

> ""The new funeral parlour complex will be a modern facility which provides a dignified setting for the deceased, bereaved families and the larger community,"" said the agencies.

> ""The design by the consultants features a low-rise complex sensitively integrated with the topography and surrounding greenery. This includes the adoption of a naturalistic colour palette, as well as landscaping on the roof and in the courtyard spaces.

> ""When completed, it will set a new benchmark for future funeral parlours and after-death facilities in Singapore,"" NEA and HDB said.

> 

> Among the features of the new complex are entrances designed to face inwards towards the internal courtyards.

> For greater privacy, funerary activities will be screened from public view where possible, through the layout of the buildings and the use of screens, the agencies said.

> A centralised eco-friendly burning chamber will also be available for paper offerings, as open-air burning will not be permitted, the agencies added.

> NEA and HDB said that they would continue to consult the funeral parlour industry and incorporate suggestions on the design of the new complex where appropriate.

> SINGAPORE - For the first time, 3D-printing could be used to build landscape furniture and architectural features in a Housing Board (HDB) estate, such as a bench or a pavilion, in the upcoming Tengah and Bidadari estates.

> Using such technology would not only allow for faster, cheaper, and less labour-intensive construction, it could also increase the potential for more unconventional designs than traditional precast methods.

> This is among projects that the HDB is embarking on to improve productivity amidst sluggish productivity growth in the construction industry. Details were shared in a media briefing on Thursday (Sept 12).

> Ongoing testing in 3D-concrete printing is being done at the HDB Centre of Building Research at Woodlands, where a printer capable of building components up to 9m long by 3.5m wide by 3.8m tall is located.

> Billed as the largest 3D-printer in South-east Asia, it successfully printed a room measuring 3.6m by 3m by 2.75m in 13 hours last month (August). The printer and the work involved in installing it cost about $900,000.

> However, further research and fine-tuning are needed to determine whether 3D-printed high-rise flats could be a possibility in future.

> For example, studies are needed to ascertain if the structural integrity of 3D-printed components remains intact over a long period and in Singapore's climate.

> Mr Heru Soedarsono, deputy director of Building Design & Precast System at HDB, said: ""The use of 3D-concrete printing has opened up new and exciting possibilities for the future of construction.

> ""Architect and designers would have more free play in their designs, greater flexibility, and since the printing process is highly automated, that reduces the dependency on manual labour,"" he told reporters on Thursday.

> He added that 3D-printing is still relatively new, and HDB will continue to work with industry experts to explore its potential.

> The whole process of building the 3D-printed room, including the manual insertion of steel reinforcement bars into the structure and fitting in windows and a door, took about six days.

> In comparison, it would take more than two months to build a similar room using the conventional method of precast production. Just fabricating the precast mould alone takes up to two months, said HDB, and this does not include the time taken to design it.

> It is costly to fabricate new moulds, which have to be done as each mould set will lose its form over time. With 3D-printing, such moulds will no longer be needed.

> HDB said that for a start, it will trial the use of 3D-concrete printing for smaller components used in precinct designs such as landscape furniture and architectural features in common areas at selected projects in Tengah and Bidadari.

> These include void deck designs and texture, such as customised sun and rain screens, and 3D-artwork panels. Theme precinct furniture and curvilinear precinct pavilions are among other possibilities.

> The Bidadari estate is scheduled to be completed by 2022, while the first of five housing districts to be developed in Tengah is slated for completion by 2023.

> Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Tuesday (Sept 10) at the HDB Awards 2019 that it is currently more expensive to use the 3D-printer.

> ""But if over time, if the cost can come down, this will be a possible game changer in construction productivity in the coming years,"" he added.

> He said that HDB achieved 17.8 per cent improvement in productivity last year (2018) compared to 2010 levels. This is on track to achieve 25 per cent productivity improvement by 2020 - a target that HDB set for itself.

> HDB now takes 174 man days to build a 90-metre squared space - the equivalent of a four-room flat, compared to 205 man days in 2010, said Mr Wong.

> But it is still pushing boundaries with new technologies, for example, by collaborating with local prefabrication company Robin Village Development, Dutch engineering firm Witteveen+Bos and the Nanyang Technological University to explore 3D-concrete printing's potential.

> This tie-up was announced in July last year (2018).

> VIDEO ANALYTICS AND AI FOR WORKER SAFETY

> Besides 3D-printing, HDB is also exploring the use of video analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve safety at construction sites, by automatically detecting high-risk situations and sending alerts to the person-in-charge.

> There are two scenarios currently being tested - when workers are within a metre of a non-barricaded building edge with a fall height of more than two metres, and when they are directly under the fall path of heavy loads lifted by tower cranes.

> When such situations arise and are caught by closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras at work sites, alerts will be sent to the safety supervisor's mobile phone via the Telegram app, allowing him to take action if there are lapses.

> Such a surveillance system, to complement manual inspections, would enable round-the-clock supervision, and reduce human errors that occur due to fatigue, said HDB. The project is in collaboration with the National University of Singapore's School of Design and Environment, with support from AI Singapore.

> Ms Ng Peck Nah, deputy director of Building Construction Management, said that the project could lead to higher construction productivity with fewer delays due to safety-related incidents.

> She added that HDB will trial the system later this month (Sept) in one of its Build-To-Order projects, Clementi Peaks. The trial is expected to end in the last quarter of 2020.

> HDB said if successful, HDB could potentially scale up the tool to cover other areas to enhance worksite safety, such as workers standing on vehicular pathways, and entering confined spaces without permission.

> USING DRONES FOR BUILDING INSPECTIONS

> HDB is also looking into using drones with its partner H3Zoom.ai for the inspection of building facades, to improve worker safety and reduce dependence on manual labour.

> Currently, workers are deployed on suspended gondolas to perform this task.

> The inspection of one block may take up to several days when done manually. In a pilot trial conducted at Yuhua and Sembawang from July to October last year (2018), the inspections took between a half day and full day to complete.

> Residents were notified in advance during the trials and the area below the flight path was cordoned off for safety during the inspection.

> The drone inspection system taps on a cloud software platform to conduct a visual scan of building facades captured during inspection.

> Using AI, the system is able to process thousands of photos to identify building defects and categorise them.

> The platform then delivers a report to highlight the severity of the defects and recommend possible remedies.

> While Town Councils are responsible for the maintenance of building facades of HDB blocks, HDB complements these efforts, auditing about 1,000 buildings per year.

> The necessary rectification work can be shared with the Town Council to help them in their building maintenance works.

> HDB said it will continue to refine the system to overcome limitations, such as when inspection involves entering building recesses and air-wells which could interfere with GPS signals.

> The presence of tree foliage could also hamper the clarity of images captured on lower floors.
