Historical Tanglin Estate is centered around Tyresal Esatate house(Istana tyresall/Woodneuk) belonging to britisher Napier which was then passed down to a Johor royal family Member. (But always wonder why Tanglin road and Tanglin hill is so far away from the Istana Tyresall .and get named such...any old timer can shed some info ?!?). From a plantation estate,it became a upmarket place with more rich people buying houses there(probably due to proximity And connectivity to town ?) . Just don‚Äôt understand the reasoning for a KTM station name to be Named such when Tanglin Halt(not really a station station...just a halt) is so far away from Tanglin area. Cannot be named Queenstown as this name was only coined after independence.

And then that area has retained the ‚ÄòTanglin Halt‚Äô identity. 

Today when someone says they are from Tanglin ,They can be of a rich family. But when someone says they are from Tanglin Halt,they are definitely a peasant. Tanglin halt has some very cute blocks and couple of the blocks overlook the passing KTM trains up till Service was stopped some years ago. On the other side of the tracks is a small ridge followed by the Woking road cute houses. Used to be some kind of British army member houses/office and still retains the falvour(thanks gahment). 

Somehow the KTM line has preserved Woking Road area from Development Avalanche that singapore went through for the past 30 years. Just sad the iconic Colbar isn‚Äôt active anymore(edit:someone says it‚Äôs active!?!). Hopefully some old timer restarts it .Woking road is just walking distance from One North.

There's a dearth of good actors who can speak English on screen without sounding strange/unnatural. A bad actor with awkward acting, even just an extra/calefare (and there's been many of those around) can break your show and make it laughable.

Plus the volume of stories/episodes to churn out every week - while limiting your stories to only a few locations because you just don't have enough time to be traveling to several locations to shoot. And actors need time to rehearse their scene in order to act well.

Because you're limited to a few locations, every story very much seems to revolve around their homes or the cafe. 

Working under these constraints is like wiping your arse with only 3 squares of toilet paper. Yes, it forces you to be creative in your stories, making up reasons why anyone would be at home/cafe on a weekday during work hours, or making up reasons why a character is not seen (because they have to go shoot other shows) but I wouldn't wish that on anybody.",t3_7q300r,15-01-2018

Productions done in house have to exclusively be done in house. If all that‚Äôs available is the deaf sound guy and a wonky 90‚Äôs VHS camera. You‚Äôre shooting your show with that. Tanglin is a little different that it was shot and edited at infinite studios. But still went to Mediacorp for audio. 

No consistency in post. Shows will frequently have 4-5+ editors per episode. The sound post, if at all is done by different people all the time with no consistency and with absolutely no time. Something in the UK/US that takes a crew of 5 a week will be compressed for 1 person to do in 3 days at Mediacorp. Hence all shows sound terrible.

> What will be lost, and what has already changed in one of Singapore‚Äôs oldest districts? Residents and business owners share their stories with the programme On The Red Dot.

> SINGAPORE: When Tanglin Halt resident Venkatachalam Gomathi, 57, used to work late at the office, her neighbour made a point of checking whether her daughter was home alone.

> It is one of her precious memories of the next-door auntie, all of 97 years old.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Venkatachalam, who has lived in Tanglin Halt with her husband for 25 years, said: ‚ÄúAnd during Chinese New Year, her children would come and give a hongbao to my daughter ‚Ä¶ Very nice. Then slowly, one by one, they all left.‚Äù

> Ngern Kah Cheng has been in Tanglin Halt even longer. The 72-year-old has been selling braised duck noodles there since 1969.

> Starting out as a street hawker. (Photo courtesy of Ngern Kah Cheng.)

> Her first stall was next to a rubbish collection centre, and she had to stop serving food every time the truck came by to collect the rubbish.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Her brother, Ngern Jwee Chye, 68, later joined her as a hawker at Tanglin Halt Market and discovered the area‚Äôs ‚Äúkampung spirit‚Äù. ‚ÄúEveryone takes care of each other,‚Äù said the laksa seller.

> His sister‚Äôs husband, 72-year-old Chua Ngen Leng, added: ‚ÄúBack then, our customers were the young folks. Now, they‚Äôve become fathers and grandfathers. They bring their grandchildren here to eat. That‚Äôs almost three, four generations.‚Äù

> There is a collage of memories that many residents and visitors will have of Tanglin Halt after its 31 blocks of flats, seven commercial blocks and two markets and food centres are demolished from the end of this year.

> About to disappear.

> Advertisement

> It is the biggest project under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme since 1999, and the programme On The Red Dot discovers what will soon be missed.

> FOOD HERITAGE

> On the list are some famous food stalls that have helped to put Singapore‚Äôs hawker culture on the Unesco Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

> Wei Yi Laksa and Prawn Noodles, which Jwee Chye set up at Tanglin Halt Market in the 1990s, is considered one of Singapore‚Äôs most popular laksa stalls today. The queues start from as early as 6am.

> ‚ÄúMany traditional dishes were slowly disappearing, so after my mum taught me, I added my own flair,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt have an education, but when it came to cooking, she was number one.‚Äù

> The Ngern siblings.

> Another stall there is Tanglin Halt Original Peanut Pancake, opened in 1965 by the father-in-law of the current owner.

> Their pancake stand outs as having a distinctive flavour and a denser and chewier texture than the ones Singaporeans usually eat ‚Äî and costs only 80 cents apiece.

> But owner Teng Kiong Seng is now in his mid-70s and has not yet found a successor, nor does he know the future of his stall after the market is demolished.

> He hopes, however, to continue making his famous snack until he is about 80 years old.

> WATCH: Taste these traditional snacks at Tanglin Halt before they‚Äôre gone (2:22)

> Gabrielle Kennedy, 23, a customer at the market, said: ‚ÄúWith every stall being so different, they represent different cuisines, different cultures, and that‚Äôs just what Singapore is. So if it was to go away, it would be very sad.‚Äù

> FROM ICONS TO ARTEFACTS

> Some of Tanglin Halt‚Äôs icons are already a distant memory: The now defunct railway line, the Van Houten chocolate factory and the Setron television factory, which manufactured Singapore‚Äôs first locally-made TV sets.

> Tanglin Halt‚Äôs rows of 10-storey blocks with diagonal staircases ‚Äî completed between 1962 and 1963 as one of the five initial districts within Queenstown, Singapore‚Äôs first satellite estate ‚Äî have also become an iconic image.

> Doctor and food blogger Leslie Tay remembers visiting his maternal grandparents there and what his mother ‚Äúalways‚Äù told him: Their unit had ‚Äúso many people‚Äù that she ‚Äúgot married quickly to get out of the house‚Äù.

> A few of the residents have moved out already.

> He now feels ‚Äúquite sad‚Äù, although Kiong Seng told him they ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt complain‚Äù. The hawker said: ‚ÄúTo transform the entire area and upgrade the buildings is a must ‚Ä¶ This is part of Singapore‚Äôs future development.‚Äù

> Still, with having to leave it all behind, many residents and business owners have sentimental feelings about their personal connections in the district.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pity. I‚Äôm very emotionally invested in this place,‚Äù said 71-year-old Alice Tan, the owner of Alice‚Äôs Hair and Beauty Shop, which has been around for 50 years.

> Everyone including the customers get along well. So I feel a sense of loss and unhappiness. When the time comes to leave, I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôll accept it.

> All will not be lost, however. Museum @ My Queenstown, located in Tanglin Halt, contains artefacts from bygone industries and buildings that were once part of the neighbourhood.

> About 150 volunteers help to manage and curate this museum.

> Non-profit organisation My Community opened the museum in 2018 and has also collected stories and old photographs from residents, to be preserved at the new museum in Margaret Drive.

> VILLAGE CHIEF

> Tanglin Halt even has a village chief, as Alice Lee, 73, is fondly known as ‚Äî or whom Leslie referred to as the ‚Äúqueen of Queenstown‚Äù.

> She has lived there for 53 years now and is one of the head volunteers with the Queenstown Residents‚Äô Committee.

> Asked about the story behind her ‚Äúvillage chief‚Äù moniker, she said: ‚ÄúI used to help (residents) keep their keys in my house. Whenever they needed their key, (if) they‚Äôd lost a key or anything, they‚Äôd come to my house.

> ‚ÄúOne of the uncles lost (his) key. He had to call the key maker at midnight to come and open the door. They charged S$80. From then on, I said you can come over to my house and get your keys.‚Äù

> WATCH: The full episode ‚Äî Tanglin Halt: Bidding farewell to some of Singapore's oldest flats (23:10)

> Residents could also get a nice view from her windows, which look out on greenery. Every day at 5pm, she takes a photograph of the scenery. ‚ÄúThe view every day is different. The sky, everything, is different,‚Äù she said.

256,10,f0jdtnx,t3_d53uks,"SINGAPORE - Before Dempsey Hill sprung up in 2007, Samy's Curry was already drawing legions of loyal diners to the former military barracks.

Now, the Dempsey institution is among a number of businesses in Tanglin Village facing uncertainty over their future as the authorities finalise their plans for the next phase of its transformation.

With six months until master tenant Country City Investment's (CCI) lease for 17 blocks in the Dempsey cluster ends, some 30 sub-tenants are awaiting confirmation on whether their leases will be renewed.

Ms Nagajyothi Mahendran, director of Samy's Curry, said that the no-frills eatery started by her grandfather in the 1960s has been located for 40 years in the same building that once housed the Civil Service Club.

The restaurant was previously located in Tank Road and Pearl's Hill.

""We can't imagine moving anywhere else - we're not even thinking of plan B,"" she said. But she added that she is confident that the eatery will be able to stay.

However, two long-time tenants have already been told that they will have to vacate when their lease expires in March 2020.

Last month, a tender was launched for the four blocks occupied by The Wine Company and furniture store Timothy Oulton at CuriO for spa and wellness use.

The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) told The Straits Times that it is working on ""an overall concept master plan and a thematic approach to rejuvenate the clusters in Tanglin Village"".

Over the last year, six other conserved blocks had been put up for tender after their leases ended. They are now occupied by a co-working and fitness centre, a family club and eateries.

This included the extension of the Como Dempsey complex, which features upmarket eateries and shops, and marks the completion of the first phase of plans to introduce new concepts, the SLA said.

Plans for the remaining blocks will be announced when ready, it added.

Last year, the SLA issued a two-year tenancy term to CCI to ensure business continuity for existing tenants while it carried out enhancements to the area's infrastructure.

Visible improvements to Tanglin Village, which spans 40ha across the Dempsey, Loewen and Minden clusters, include new pedestrian walkways and signs.

The four blocks now up for tender are located adjacent to Como's complex, and observers said that it could be eyeing further expansion with its wellness brand Como Shambhala.

Asked whether it would be participating in the tender, a spokesman for Como said that it was premature to comment.

CCI's general manager Nicholas Ng said that it is working to find alternate locations for the displaced tenants, and awaiting updates from the SLA on its master lease.

The Wine Company's co-owner, Ms Belinda Lim, said that the store will be moving to a smaller unit at Block 9, which has been vacated by gourmet store and bistro Culina.

Culina, which is under Como Lifestyle, is now located within Como Dempsey.

Ms Lim said that while she had been eyeing other locations, she decided to stay within Dempsey as it has been home since 2003.

CCI, which developed Dempsey Hill in 2007, helped to brand the area as a lifestyle enclave and now has more than 50 sub-tenants across the Dempsey and Loewen clusters.

Tanglin Village, which originated as British military barracks in the 1860s, was also headquarters for the Ministry of Defence before being let out mainly to furniture stores in the 1990s.

Mr Ng said that CCI's vision was to create a lifestyle destination, set among lush greenery, that appealed to locals and expats alike.

""We inherited the furniture tenants who were pioneers here, and tried to find ways to fit them into the overall concept we had,"" he said.

Long Beach Seafood was brought in to complement Samy's Curry next door, while Dempsey Hill featured more international concepts, including Jones the Grocer and other new-to-Singapore brands.

The blocks bounded by Loewen Road, meanwhile, focused on commercial schools and family-related activities.

As Tanglin Village enters its next stage of transformation, some long-time tenants worry that they will no longer have a place in it.

Hedger's Carpet Gallery was relocated to another unit within Dempsey when Block 15 was returned to the SLA last year, and the new premises have been in need of repair, said owner Peter Hedger.

But with the two-year lease hanging over his head, he has been putting off renovations.

""We're all in limbo. The sooner we know, the sooner we can make arrangements,"" he said.

Ms Glenda Lim, who has run wood furnishing store Maywell Lifestyles with her husband since 1996, said that business has slowed over the years amid a thinning expat clientele.

The store survives on regular customers and foot traffic from Como Dempsey.

""We hope to stay on because our history here is so long - it's sentimental value more than anything else,"" she said.

Other Dempsey establishments, including Open Farm Community, White Rabbit and Huber's Butchery, which lease their spaces directly from the SLA, said that they have some years left and plan to stay on.

Businesses in the area said that while plans to jazz up Tanglin Village are welcome, they hope that it will retain its unspoilt charm.

IT executive Justin Chin, who has been frequenting Tanglin Village for the last 30 years, said that the area could benefit from more nightlife options, such as cocktail bars.

Mr Chin, who is in his 50s, said: ""The tenant mix now is a bit rojak, but it's not a bad thing. You don't want it to be too homogeneous or commercial, like another mall.""",t3_d53uks,16-09-2019
