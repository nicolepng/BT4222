21,11,gmdrb2n,t3_lej5dq,"> # Thomson Rd condo forbids maids from using facilities, threatens non-complying residents with 'period ban'

> In Singapore, families often employ a live-in foreign domestic helper to aid with household chores.

> These helpers, when not working, usually spend their off-days relaxing and taking part in recreational activities.

> However, for one condominium in Singapore, domestic helpers will have to perform these activities somewhere else.

> Sent in to Mothership by a reader, a circular for Cube 8 — a condominium along Thomson Road — told residents that its facilities were for the ""exclusive use of residents and their guests"".

> ""Domestic helpers are not allowed to use the recreational facilities.""

> ""Any domestic helper, found in the recreational facilities in the absence of their resident employer, will be evicted immediately,"" continued the notice written by the condominium's management, Empire City Consultants.

> Residents who breached the rule would be subjected to ""a period ban"" from the facilities it added.

> The full notice can be seen here:

> According to a listing on Property Guru, Cube 8's residents and guests have access to facilities such as:

> barbecue area

> function room

> gym

> sauna

> swimming pool

> fitness corner

> playground

> tennis courts

> game room

> Mental health among helpers

> A 2015 study published by the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME), found that about 24 per cent of helpers in Singapore suffered from poor mental health.

> In contrast, the study cited Institute of Mental Health research that found about 12 per cent of Singaporeans suffered from mental health problems.

> HOME's survey also found that a positive perception of being treated with dignity and integration into the employer's family was beneficial for the mental health of helpers.

> Mothership has reached out to Empire City Consultants for comment.

The root cause of this behaviour goes back far deeper, in human nature itself. Even if you took a time machine to precolonial Singapore, even if you rewrote history so that the Brits never arrived, some people would still choose to be assholes towards other people whom they perceive to be lesser. Before the Brits arrived (and incidentally banned the practice), Temasek was a slave-owning society.

It's absolutely not colonialism, because of the bolded term. Maids are not ""one people"". In this context, ""a people"" means ""a country/nation/race/tribe"". 

If a guy beats his girlfriend that's subjugation but not colonialism. If a gang wins a turf war against another gang it's domination but not colonialism. When the people of Britain/Japan ruled over the people of Singapore, it was colonialism. Definitions are important.

There are always comparisons to politicians in other parts of the world. No one in the parliament dared to blatantly point out the other part of the equation for diplomacy reasons: the large sums of political donations.

I've seen discussions in the US and Taiwan talk about the lawmakers' quality in recent years and there seems to be a worrying trend that capable individuals would choose to focus and lead the private sector than to be a politician. I honestly feel that the same thing will happen soon in Singapore, and I don't even know how it will be like in the future. Perhaps you believe that Singapore can attract individuals that are on par with the private sector or better. And maybe you believe that it can be done with the burning passion of our prospective ministers to serve even when they'll have better prospects in the private sector. I'm not that optimistic.

The argument about big business owners and wealthy landlord if true can also be applied to lawmakers in the US, but I don't see them being satisfied. There's a term in US called Corporate America if you haven't heard of it, and it describes what you've said. But still, I see that a lot  of lobbying going around.",t3_lej5dq,08-02-2021

Maybe someone can enlighten me on that.

We're in the century where what's popular is becoming more important than what has to be done. We see it everywhere: US, Taiwan, Philippines, Brazil, India, Brexit, Australia, etc. The government might be trying teach the ""do what is right not what is popular"" rhetoric but I think that that's infeasible in today's world.

As for lobbying, I'm just showing that it's not impossible to lobby the government given that what you've said is true. I have to admit that I don't see what makes Singapore unique from the other cases.

The talent issue isn't as hard to solve as we might think. The PAP simply aren't expanding their definition of talent. They can tap into their expansive grassroots network and party activists for candidates instead of having to woo reluctant private sector individuals.",t3_lej5dq,08-02-2021

> SINGAPORE — Japan’s largest train operator East Japan Railway Company (JR East) will open retail shops in 27 of the 32 stations on the future Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL), which is slated to begin operations in phases from the end of this year.

> According to a report by Japanese media Kyodo News, JR East will operate the retail space which may house some Japanese tenants.

> The company plans to open shops in three stations — Woodlands North, Woodlands and Woodlands South — in December, the report said.

> JR East is the first Japanese railway operator to develop commercial facilities at metro stations in foreign countries.

> The Land Transport Authority (LTA) had announced in August that it would be outsourcing the rail system’s non-fare business for the first time and had awarded tenders for the operation of advertising and retail spaces along the future TEL.

> The LTA said then that the retail operator of the train line will be a three-way consortium comprising SMRT Experience, JR East Business Development SEA and Alphaplus Investments.

> SMRT Experience manages the retail and advertising spaces in train stations and bus interchanges run by transport operator SMRT, while Alphaplus Investments is an investment company of supermarket chain NTUC FairPrice.

> Kyodo News’ report on Wednesday said that the three companies will establish Stellar Singapore-Japan Retail in October to operate the retail spaces, with JR East Business Development SEA holding a 35 per cent stake.

> The new operator will rent 5,000 sqm of floor space from LTA for 16 years starting from the end of 2019.

> The largest shopping area, at 1,570 sqm, will be at Woodlands station, it added.

> The 43km, 32-station TEL — to be operated by SMRT — will open in five stages between this year and 2024. It will serve Changi Airport by about 2040.

Oh, and sometimes the JR Station and the SBS station aren't even in the same place, and you have to go out the station and walk another 10 minutes just to transfer.  


Then you go into some stations, and some don't even have lifts. Some trains have no wheelchair access because the train carriage is higher than the platform, and they'd have to put a ramp or some other form of linkage so wheelchair-bound persons can actually board the train.

The term swivel gun (or simply swivel) usually refers to a small cannon, mounted on a swiveling stand or fork which allows a very wide arc of movement. Another type of firearm referred to as a swivel gun was an early flintlock combination gun with two barrels that rotated along their axes to allow the shooter to switch between rifled and smoothbore barrels.Swivel guns should not be confused with pivot guns, which were far larger weapons mounted on a horizontal pivot, or screw guns, which are a mountain gun with a segmented barrel. An older term for the type is peterero (alternative spellings include ""paterero"" and ""pederero""). The name was taken from the Spanish name for the gun, pedrero, a combination of the word piedra (stone) and the suffix -ero (-er), because stone was the first type of ammunition fired.

Look at similar landscapes or pastoral scenes from the same time period.

Here are more articles that provide details on this species, and the efforts to save it:

[Saving Raffles' Banded Langurs](https://www.nss.org.sg/articles/9978f100-f08-13-LangurC.pdf): an article penned by Dr. Andie Ang for the Nature Society (Singapore)'s Nature Watch magazine. She also gave a talk a few years back, you can view it here [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/n8HEOUNN868).

The IUCN's [Species Action Plan for the Conservation of
Raffles' Banded Langur (*Presbytis femoralis femoralis*)
in Malaysia and Singapore](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/Rep-2016-022.pdf)

Dr. Andie Ang's [Primate Watching](https://www.primatewatching.com/p-femoralis) page on the Raffles' Banded Langur provides some information on finding this species in the wild.

The work is partially funded by the Wildlife Reserves Singapore Conservation Fund. Here's [the page](https://www.wrs.com.sg/en/protecting-wildlife/conservation/singapore/conservation-of-singapores-own-raffles-bonded-langur.html) providing more information about this species and the research that's being done.

There's also the Raffles' Banded Langurs page on Facebook, which posts regular news and updates. Right now the page is sharing more about the various plant species that the langurs have been observed consuming.

Finally, the Raffles' Banded Langur is heavily featured in [Forest Life episode](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/video-on-demand/wild-city-forest-life) of Wild City.

It's also important to note that with recent changes in taxonomy, what we used to know as the Banded Leaf Monkey is actually 3 different species, with non-overlapping ranges; the Raffles' Banded Langur is only found in southern Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, while the East Sumatran Banded Langur is endemic to Sumatra, and Robinson's Banded Langur is native to northern Peninsular Malaysia and southern Thailand and Myanmar. We don't know much about the population of Raffles' Banded Langurs in Malaysia, but widespread deforestation in Johor means that they're also severely threatened. So while Singapore's population isn't much, it might still represent a significant proportion of the remaining global population - a really worrying state of affairs. Here's hoping that there will be more conservation efforts in both Malaysia and Singapore, and that this species will be able to recover its numbers.",t3_g2ug3m,17-04-2020

the number is on every platform, but it's not really that important much in terms of wayfinding, so I don't think people will confuse exit numbers with the route thing",t3_enlnvd,12-01-2020

maybe laypeople can give the excuse that stations here are bound by the limited space for its construction but that doesnt not deny that stations here are designed poorly.

It's interesting to note that the juvenile Wagler's look like the male with the light green colouration, but in females they gradually darken in colour to a deep green. I believe the huge size of the female allows them to hunt larger prey like squirrels and bats, preventing competition with the males who can only kill lizards and maybe small birds. Or it could just be because the female needs to be ""pregnant"" with young, since vipers are ovoviviparous (they hold their eggs in their body until they hatch, and the young are ""born"").

> SINGAPORE - How much will property-crazed Singaporeans pay for an abandoned house where skeletal remains were found?

> The answer may be revealed next week.

> One of Singapore&apos;s most storied houses at Sembawang Hills Estate in Upper Thomson where skeletal remains of two sisters were found about 10 years apart will be put up for sale by auction by the Government next Tuesday (Feb 27).

> The Public Trustee&apos;s Office took ownership of the house at 17, Jalan Batai in 2015 after it remained in a dilapidated state for more than a decade. The Public Trustee&apos;s Office has appointed real estate company Knight Frank to auction the house next Tuesday.

> The house belonged to a pair of reclusive sisters, Madam Pearl Tan Leen Hee, a former civil servant, and Madam Ruby Tan. They would have been 81 and 68 respectively in 2006.

> In 2006, National Environment Agency officers entered the house for a mosquito check after neighbours complained of mosquito breeding. The workers found a human skeleton in a toilet.

> In September 2015, a contractor hired by the Building and Construction Authority entered the house to erect a temporary roof after parts of the roof collapsed. A worker clearing rubble from a bedroom found another set of bones - a human skull and a thigh bone.

> Neither set of skeletal remains could be identified as DNA could not be obtained from the bone samples.

> The state coroners in both cases ruled out foul play, but declared an open verdict on the causes of death as they could not be determined.

> But State Coroner Marvin Bay, who held the inquiry on the second set of remains, said in 2016 that the remains conformed more closely to Madam Ruby Tan&apos;s chronological age. A pathologist had estimated that the second set of remains belonged to someone who died at least a few years ago and was likely to be 60 to 70 years of age.

> A view of the living room in July 2006, when the first set of remains was found. The two sisters who lived in the house were reclusive. PHOTO: ST FILE

> A spokesman for the Public Trustee&apos;s Office said on Friday (Feb 23) that it took over the house in 2015 after the High Court declared both sisters to be presumed dead.

> ""Pearl was the elder sister and owner of the property. Both sisters were unmarried,"" said the spokesman. ""As Ruby was younger, she is presumed to have died after Pearl, and, therefore, the sale proceeds from Pearl&apos;s estate will be inherited by Ruby&apos;s estate before being accrued to the state.""

> The spokesman said it received some claims made by relatives but threw them out.

> ""The claimants were unable to show evidence that they had stayed in any contact with the sisters, nor any evidence that they provided for the sisters or took care of the sisters before the sisters died,"" said the Public Trustee&apos;s Office, without naming the relatives.

> The Straits Times visited the house this week, and found the rusted gates locked. Weeds were growing from cracks on the wall.

> The house, which sits on 1,720 sq ft of land, or about the size of two four-room Housing Board flats, was missing a front door and windows.

> Ms Tricia Tan, an estate agent from Knight Frank who is handling the auction, said there was some interest in bidding for the house.

> ""The location is not bad, but some people may be pantang,&apos;&apos; she said, using the Malay word for ""superstitious"".

> Whether the auction is successful depends on whether the bids exceed the reserve price set by the Public Trustee&apos;s Office, she said.

> The Public Trustee&apos;s Office declined to say what reserve price it has set, saying only: ""The reserve price will be determined with reference to the valuation carried out by a qualified valuer."" It added that Knight Frank has valued the property at $1.85 million.

> International Property Advisor chief executive Ku Swee Yong said: ""The market value of the land, without the house, is about $1.7 million to $1.8 million for landed homes in the location.""

> He noted that media reports have said that properties with grim histories in Hong Kong were sold for about 15 per cent cheaper.

> ""However, in Singapore, we are probably less averse to homes and locations with such history. In this particular case, there were possibly deaths in the house, but they could be natural deaths, rather than (due to) more macabre reasons such as murder or suicide, which we may associate with suffering and pain,"" he said.

> He added: ""Just recently, Singaporeans rushed like bees to honey for high-priced Build-to-Order HDB flats in Bidadari, which, up to about 15 years ago, was a well-known landmark, a large cemetery.""

> He noted that the auction will attract small developers who will tear down the old house and build a new one, before selling or renting it to someone who does not mind the grim past.

> One of those thinking about making a bid at the auction is Mr Raymond Oke, a contractor in his 40s who lives next door. He rented the house next to 17, Jalan Batai about five years ago and never met the sisters.

> He said it was not a big problem living next to the abandoned house, except for worries about mosquito breeding.

> ""Maybe after some time, when a new house is built, people will forget about the sad history of the old house,"" said Mr Oke.

> SINGAPORE: Tables at Koufu food court at Thomson Plaza will soon have shields installed on them, as part of a trial to create a safe way for people to dine in at eateries during Phase 2 of Singapore's post-circuit breaker period.

> The 3mm acrylic shields are ""fully customisable to fit tables of different shapes and sizes"", said ComfortDelGro in a media release on Wednesday (Jun 10).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Similar shields are currently being trialled in 400 ComfortDelGro taxis to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

> Under the month-long trial, 50 tables at Koufu's Thomson Plaza food court will be outfitted with the shields.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> For rectangular-shaped tables, the shields will be housed in aluminium frames and clamped across the middle of each table.

> ""The shield itself does not rest on the table so cleaners can wipe the tabletop without having to remove it,"" said ComfortDelGro.

> Tables at the Thomson Plaza Koufu food court will be outfitted with acrylic shields when dining in is allowed again in Phase 2 of Singapore's post-circuit breaker period. (Photo: ComfortDelGro)

> Round tables will be outfitted with three separate shields in a cylindrical aluminium structure, providing a partition for each diner.

> There is also a cut-out at the bottom of each partition that allows for easy cleaning, said ComfortDelGro.

> Moove Media, a wholly owned subsidiary of ComfortDelGro, owns the trademark for the shield and will sponsor the shields at the food court.

> Moove Media CEO Jayne Kwek said the company looked at how the shields in taxis could be applied to other environments to minimise the spread of COVID-19.

> ""In our discussions with Koufu, we started exploring the possibility of trialling the V-Shield on dining tables as a safe solution for patrons to eat in comfort and safety once dining-in is allowed in Phase 2 of reopening,"" Mrs Kwek added.

> Koufu chief operating officer Choo Teck Chuan said the trial will allow the food court operator to ""evaluate the effectiveness of the shield and to address operational issues such as maintenance and cleanliness"".

> Moove Media said that if the shields are well-received by diners during the trial, it will work with Koufu and possibly other food court operators to install the shields on more tables.

This, apparently.

Plenty of things to change, paperwork, operating procedures, signs and maps (which have probably already been ordered, even made), and then you have to get your staff and perhaps the public to remember which station code TE31 now refers to (for example). They did a network-wide renumbering once already back when Dover station opened, I doubt they'd want to do it again.

Of all the things we had to learn from the Taiwanese, though... (there's a station on the Taoyuan Airport line numbered A14a)

EDIT: And even if they wanted to do a renumbering, there's an unopened TE4a station, they could probably wait for that station to open and then renumber everything in one go.",t3_adekjp,07-01-2019

> Transit signs will also be improved, starting with the new Thomson-East Coast Line stations, with larger font, new icons, sharper colour contrast and a new signbox design.

> After the Woodlands North MRT station opens, the route for bus service 856 - which operates between Woodlands and Yishun - will be changed to connect commuters to the new station, said LTA.

> The whole line will be fully operational by 2025.

> It will add 32 new stations to the rail network and is expected to serve about 500,000 commuters daily in the initial years of operation, with this figure expected to rise to about 1 million commuters in the longer term.
