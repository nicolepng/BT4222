82,18,g9b1kc4,t1_g9axcw0,"From an American woman's perspective: 

Pros: it is a fun romp about a young American woman who unexpectedly has to take her boss's place at her marketing company's Paris branch. Along the way she makes friends, attracts a LOT of male attention, and has a lot of exciting experiences. It's not a heavy show, you can turn your mind off and enjoy.

Cons: It's a very optimistic view of being an expat in Paris. People seem to always be going out of their way to accommodate or assist Emily. She can also come across as quite spoiled in terms of cultural assimilation and takes a lot of liberties at her new job role that would get anyone else fired.

In conclusion: The series feels like it was written with young women as the intended audience in terms of situations and emotional maturity. It's sort of like Sex and the City for women in their early twenties (Darren Star created both shows). 

If you're enough of a romantic to enjoy such situations and can suspend disbelief, then go ahead and watch. If you prefer more realistic shows, this probably won't be for you.",t3_jdsbov,19-10-2020

> If you prefer more realistic shows, this probably won't be for you.

This is an understatement. It's a dreamlike portrayal of Paris that, as you rightfully said, takes a fair amount of liberties. Great for turning your brain off for a few hours but obviously not meant to be accurate. 

I wish the show included the horrendous smell of piss that follows you around late at night. Or the drunkards and troublemakers on the RER. Or the overpriced food at famous destinations. Or the hordes of tourists. Or the pickpockets that can spot a clueless tourist from a distance away.

176,18,fkk023l,t1_fkji938,"While hornbills are monogamous, and tend to mate for life, a hornbill that loses its mate is more likely to just move on and find another one.

The only time a hornbill will possibly die after the loss of its partner is during the breeding season - upon finding a suitable nest site, usually a large tree hole, the hornbill pair will use soil, clay, and even their own droppings to seal the female inside, leaving just a narrow gap that is wide enough for the male's beak.

For many species of hornbills, once she's sealed inside, the female sheds her flight feathers, leaving her completely helpless and dependent on the male to provide her with food. If something happens to him, she is doomed; even if she breaks out of the nest prematurely, her flight feathers would not have grown back yet, making it difficult for her to fend for herself. But during other times of the year, hornbills that lose their mates, both male and female, have no problem getting on with life and eventually finding new partners.

The purpose of sealing the female inside the nest has been [debated by scientists](https://whyy.org/segments/in-quest-for-fidelity-a-model-from-the-animal-kingdom/), with several different hypotheses put forward.",t3_fiusfs,15-03-2020

[**Bear Grylls Sahara Quicksand video**](https://youtu.be/MJTGwZM05lQ?t=100) 

If you are waist deep in quicksand, 

1. Flop your chest forward onto the surface of the sand.
2. Put your body weight on your chest.
3. Wriggle a leg out of the sand.
4. Monkey crawl your way out of the sand.

[**How to escape quicksand at Mont Saint Michel in France video**](https://youtu.be/z0CFgdMjS5w?t=159) (Loud wind noise in the video. Headphone users beware.) 

If you are thigh deep in quicksand, 

1. Balance yourself on one leg.
2. Gently shake the other leg in a slow stirring motion to free your leg up from the quicksand. 
3. Once your leg is free, brace your knee on the surface of the sand. 
4. Put your body weight on the knee.
5. Shake your remaining trapped leg gently to get it free from the sand.

>Quicksand—that is, sand that behaves as a liquid because it is saturated with water—can be a mucky nuisance, but it’s basically impossible to die in the way that is depicted in movies. That’s because quicksand is denser than the human body. People and animals can get stuck in it, but they don’t get sucked down to the bottom—they float on the surface.

It's *not* quicksand. According to TS u/palindrome77's description:
> a man buried waist deep in what appeared to be some *black mud-like* substance. He *wasn't sinking any further* [...] My shoes and shorts were covered into *black muck*.

Quicksand is not mucky. If the substrate is black & mucky, it's likely to be *mangrove mud*. Even deeper (below the mangrove mud) would be *marine clay* -- which has a cement-grey colour & a very soft peanut butter-like mucky texture.

In both mangrove mud & marine clay, you will sink to a significant depth if you're wearing normal shoes, but these substrates (unlike quicksand) won't swallow you up within seconds. You just feel like you are stuck inside a giant tub of peanut butter.

Mangrove mud & marine clay are common at coastal & riverine areas -- both current, as well as historical (reclaimed & built over). For instance, if you dig a deep hole in the middle of Sengkang Park or Bishan Park, you can hit marine clay within 1 to 1.5 m of the surface.

Pasir Ris Park itself was built from mangrove swamp, & whilst one may not be digging holes in the middle of Pasir Park, there are still remnant mangrove & offshore areas where the original mangrove mud & marine clay substrates are just barely below the more modern surface. 

And like TS, I had the same sinking-&-stuck-in-black-muck experience years ago, when I was looking at mudskippers at the lower reaches of Sungei Pandan (after the tidal gate) during low tide.

One moment I was on relatively firm substrate, & the next step resulted in my entire leg suddenly sinking into the viscous black mud up to my hip. My hands were muddied as well when I tried to break my fall straight down into the mud.

Luckily, since I was just 1 m away from the river bank & with one leg still free, my captive leg did not manage to sink any further beyond my hip. The base of the mud column closer to the centre of the river (which looks tantalizingly walkable during low tide) would probably be somewhat deeper, possibly reaching neck depth.

In the end, I managed to slowly haul my sunken leg out of the mangrove mud. Somewhere nearer the surface, my securely-laced sports shoe came off, & I had to stick my arm into the black muck to find the buried shoe & scoop it out.",t3_ap3otn,16-02-2019

> A human is unlikely to sink entirely into quicksand and drown at all due to the higher density of the fluid (assuming the quicksand is on dry ground and not under water, but even if underwater, sinking is still improbable). Quicksand has a density of about 2 grams per milliliter, whereas the density of the human body is only about 1 gram per milliliter. At that level of density, sinking in quicksand is impossible. Descending about up to the waist is possible, but not any further. Even objects with a higher density than quicksand will float on it—until they move. Aluminum, for example, has a density of about 2.7 grams per milliliter, but a piece of aluminum will float on top of quicksand until motion causes the sand to liquefy.

624,18,ev3qdq8,t3_chzfqn,"It is not a traveling salesman problem.

It is a shortest path problem on an unweighted directed graph. Define your graph as such:

**1. Vertices are directional non-intersecting MRT line segments.**

Each segment of a MRT line that does not intersect any other MRT line gives 2 vertices, one representing each direction of travel. For example, The segment between Tuas Link and Jurong East has 2 vertices: one in the ""Tuas Link -> Jurong East"" direction, and one in the ""Jurong East -> Tuas Link"" direction.

**2. Edges are MRT line transfers.**

Each vertex *v* has an outgoing directed edge towards each vertex in the set *h(v)*.  Define *h(v)* as the set of line segments such that for each line segment *w* in *h(v)*:

* *w* starts at the terminating point of *v*;
* *w* has a different colour from *v*.

For example, the vertex for ""Botanic Gardens -> Bishan"" (call it *v*), has outgoing directed edges to the vertices for ""Bishan -> Choa Chu Kang"" and ""Bishan -> Newton""; but **not** ""Choa Chu Kang -> Bishan"" or ""Newton -> Bishan"" (does not start at the terminating point of *v*); **nor** ""Bishan -> Botanic Gardens"" or ""Bishan -> Serangoon"" (same colour as *v*).

**Problem instance**

For this problem the origin vertex of the shortest path problem is ""Tuas Link -> Jurong East"" and the destination vertex is ""Tampines -> Pasir Ris"".

**Algorithm**

Having constructed the graph, run breadth-first search for the solution. Time complexity and space complexity are linear in the product *b|V|* of the graph, where *b* (branching factor) is the maximum out-degree of any vertex, and *V* is the set of vertices. To reduce memory to be linear in search depth *d*, while sacrificing time due to repeated visit inefficiencies giving *b^d* in time, use iterative depth-first search.

Note that this graph has cycles. Note also that this formulation works even if LRT lines are considered.

Since dear fellow redditporean u/wyred-sg said that it is not restricted to just travelling on the MRT, I have a solution here.
<Transport mode>

1. Tuas Link <EWL> to Jurong East
2. Jurong East <NSL> to Choa Chu Kang 
3. Choa Chu Kang <BPLRT> to Bukit Panjang (with the loop inside the LRT)
4. Bukit Panjang <DTL> Expo
5. Expo <EWL> Changi Airport
6. Changi Airport Terminal 3 (PTB3) Bus Stop code 95109 <858> Woodlands Temp Int
7. Woodlands Temp Int <187/963> Blk 223 Bus Stop code 44269 
8. Blk 223 Bus Stop code 44269 <190> Choa Chu Kang Int
9. Choa Chu Kang <NSL> Marina South Pier
10. Marina South Pier Bus Stop code 03419 <400> Marina Bay Stn Bus Stop code 03539
11. Marina Bay <CCL> Promenade 
12. Promenade Stn Bus Stop code 02161 <111> Dhoby Ghaut Stn Bus Stop code 08031
13. Dhoby Ghaut <CCL> Harbourfront (one overlap at Promenade Station 😐)
14. Harbourfront <NEL> Sengkang 
15. Sengkang LRT East Loop
16. Sengkang LRT West Loop
17. Sengkang <NEL> Punggol 
18. Punggol LRT East Loop
19. Punggol LRT West Loop
20. Punggol Interchange <83> Sengkang Interchange
21. Sengkang Interchange <156> Clementi Interchange
22. Clementi <EWL> Pasir Ris

Hornbill pairs are territorial, and a single pair of adults can't produce so many young at once, so it might be a group of subadults that have dispersed from their own families and are hanging out together. As they grow older, they'll eventually pair up and establish their own territories.

I went to read up a bit more and it turns out that the Oriental Pied Hornbill is known to form flocks outside of the breeding season, comprising both adults and juveniles. I guess they're friendlier to each other when you don't have a prime nesting spot and food resources to defend. And in some cases, the young from previous broods might stay with their parents for a while after fledging, so you might also have seen a pair with 2 or more batches of offspring.

> Some recovering Covid-19 patients will be moved out of hospitals to a “Community Isolation Facility” at D’Resort in Pasir Ris, from Tuesday, Mar. 24.

> The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced this in a press release issued on Mar. 24.

> On Tuesday, 49 new Covid-19 cases were also announced, bringing the total number of cases to 558.

> Patients to be isolated and receive medical care

> The patients will continue to be isolated at the facility, which has a capacity of about 500 persons.

> They will also receive medical care there, although these patients “do not generally require significant medical care”, as these patients are “clinically well enough to be discharged from medical care” even though they still test positive for Covid-19.

> MOH said that the facility is modelled after existing Government Quarantine Facilities, though the staff there would observe “a higher baseline level of infection control”.

> MOH also said that the cost of being isolated in the Community Isolation Facility would be borne by the government.

> Legal requirement to remain in isolation facility

> Patients sent to the isolation facility will be served with an “isolation order”, which legally requires them to remain in the facility and isolate themselves, MOH’s Director of Medical Services Kenneth Mak said, at a press conference on Mar. 24.

> Mak explained that the isolation order would be the “equivalent of a quarantine order”, issued to ensure that these patients remain in the facility and respect the rules.

> He added that the isolation order would be lifted when the patients no longer test positive for Covid-19 infection, and are deemed fit to return home by doctors.

> Previous policy of hospitalising all cases “not efficient”

> Previously, all patients were hospitalised, which MOH explained was to help with understanding of the disease, as well as to isolate Covid-19 patients.

> However, this has not been an efficient use of hospital resources, MOH said on Mar. 24.

> Thus, setting up the Community Isolation Facility would help to ensure that healthcare facilities in Singapore are able to cope with “a possible surge” in cases.

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong had previously said that Covid-19 patients who required less support could potentially be housed in alternative facilities, instead of being hospitalised, at a press conference on Mar. 18.

> Gan also said that approximately 80 per cent of the people who were hospitalised required minimal health support.

> The WP members that will be taking care of the GRC include He Ting Ru, Jamus Lim, Raeesah Khan and Louis Chua.

> WP's He Ting Ru updates Sengkang residents on town council matters

> The leader of the team, Ting Ru, acknowledged that there was some confusion in the past week after Polling Day results.

> Some residents have been calling the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) to report estate matters and Ting Ru clarified that the Sengkang residents can still seek help from the Pasir Ris - Punggol Town Council (PRPGTC) and Ang Mo Kio Town Council (AMKTC) during this transition period.

> Ting Ru, who is the chairman of the Sengkang Town Council (SKTC), also shared some information on the handover.

> This includes WP's team seeking documents from PRPGTC and AMKTC on July 15 a request they repeated on July 17 after a virtual meeting initiated by PRPGTC.

> Ting Ru also said that the team asked for a physical meeting to discuss further and to be briefed by the two town councils that are currently serving the residents.

> Janil: WP's Sengkang team not ready to be briefed earlier

> In response to Ting Ru's Facebook update on July 19, Pasir-Ris Punggol GRC MP Janil Puthucheary said on Facebook later in the evening that the PRPG and AMK teams are ready for a smooth handover ""as soon as SKTC is ready, in the interests of residents"".

> Janil said that the PRPG and AMK TCs chairmen designates have been ready since last week to kickstart the handover process as prescribed by the Ministry of National Development.

> He said that the initial contact with the WP's team had been through individuals who were not the elected SKTC members.

> They requested to get in touch with the SKTC Chairman and the appointed team.

> Subsequently, they had the July 17's virtual meeting with Ting Ru and fellow Sengkang teammate Chua.

> WP's Sylvia Lim, Png Eng Huat and an AHTC staff member also attended the virtual meeting.

> Ting Ru provided a point of contact the next day and the PRPGTC told her that they will be furnishing the requested contracts on July 20.

> Janil added that the SKTC team was ""not ready"" to receive the briefing that was offered on July 17 and they will be meeting again in person on July 23, Wednesday.

Not sure what this is about. Seems like someone in WP, that was not the four mp-elects, approached PRPGTC for the contracts and got stonewalled.

>	The SKTC team were not ready to receive the briefing that we offered at the meeting on the 17th July, but we look forward to discussing the issues at the in-person meeting on the 23rd July.

Seemed like SKTC wanted to see the contracts first before the discussion so that they can question PRPGTC on anything that is unusual or unexplained. PRPGTC wanted to do the briefing on the 17th without SKTC having had the opportunity to read through the contracts, but WP declined. Janil then says the WP team was not ready.

Frankly even if not ready, I would cut the WP some slack since their victory was not exactly expected and it's good on them to let residents know who to reach out to during the transition.

On your point on echo chamber, my suggestion is to just move on and don't comment on the political posts or only when you disagree with the PAP on certain policies. Then again, that's if you value karma (which I do! even if it's silly). Accept that the subreddit is an echo chamber and use it as such. Even echo chambers have value. For example, it shows what people in the echo chamber thinks. Just don't rely on it for a civil discussion.

To be fair, I will say that where's there's mixed responses (in terms of upvoted/downvotes) where outright factual errors are pointed out. The caveat is that the original incorrect comment will often, but not always, have more upvotes.

Also doesn't help that mentally ill people are encouraged to be upfront and honest about their condition, yet society disregard them at the same time. Claiming that they are just weak individuals that needs to get more sunlight and exercise. Or just get a job as if employees are all willing to open arms and accept a mentally ill individual. It's a tough spot and unfortunately there is no way to educate the public who thinks they are too smart and better than everyone else cause they were born into a good family.

1. the hawker centre is close to the mrt station. but what is visible from the mrt is just a wall with the words pasir ris hawker in faint colours. the stalls within and seats/tables are not visible unless you walk into the palce. 

2. 2 levels of hawkers. but there is lousy layout to get to second floor. either walk up a closed staircase with dim lights. or take the lift from the back of stalls. some sunlight or windows in the staircase would help a lot. gives a better vibe.


3. nice layout of actual hawker stalls. its open and airy. but hardly a crowd during lunch. white sands is crowded with students and office workers eating...but not this place.


what's the point of asking for marketing funds when initial layout and design of the hawker centre is so stupid. they need a multi million dollar makeover to make the place more physically visible and improve the staircase.  

just saying again. better to let these social enterprise hawker centres die out by not patronising them. not sure what they value add to the standard hawker model nea already runs. seems more of socializing costs and privatizing profits. ",t3_9dsfzr,07-09-2018

$1400 from **each stall** for cleaning and washing. but somehow cleaners still paid about $1000+ only.  

someone should investigate if ntuc foodfare outsource these services like dishwashing or marketing to $2 companies like AIM.

> Currently owners of e-scooters don't need to do the following:

>Register with TP, which enables them to evade any responsibility in an accident quite easily.

> Undergo any basic theory or practical riding lessons, which would ensure users know how to handle their PMD in a responsible manner and set a certain standard of behaviour that we, the general public should reasonably expect from them.

> Have mandatory, initial and periodical inspections of their scooters by an accredited government body, which is essential to ensure that they are road-worthy, safe to ride in a public area and most importantly, won't catch fire when they're charging overnight in an enclosed area.

> Mandatory insurance coverage for their PMD, which would ensure that any injured victims get compensated for their medical bills should the PMD user get involved in an accident.

> Jail time for committing a serious offence with a PMD. They can also own and operate a PMD even after being convicted of an offence unlike vehicle license holders, who are generally barred from operating a vehicle for a certain period of time if they have been convicted of a serious traffic offence. IMO PMD users shouldn't be getting off that easily after being convicted for a serious offence.

> List not exhaustive, feel free to add on.

> I think the gahmen needs to seriously take a look at the following and decide whether all that regulation and enforcement is worth all the trouble or just give up and ban those things already.

> SINGAPORE: A 24-year-old man has been arrested over a case of rash act causing hurt along Pasir Ris Drive 1, police said on Friday (Apr 13). 

> An 11-year-old girl was also taken to KK Women&apos;s and Children&apos;s Hospital on Thursday night, authorities added. 

> The girl&apos;s father, Mr Rahmat Nizam Samat, said his wife received a phone call at around 7.15pm alerting her that her daughter was bleeding at the mouth outside Pasir Ris East Community Club (CC).  

> ""I made my way there and found out she had been hit from the back by an e-scooter rider,"" Mr Rahmat Nizam told Channel NewsAsia. 

> ""The doctors at KK hospital had to realign my kid&apos;s jaw and gums. She lost two teeth due to the incident and sustained cuts and abrasions to her head and under her right eye, as well as to her left palm, elbows and knees.""

> He added: ""She was given seven days of MC and will need to return (on Friday) for further check-ups."" 

> Police investigations are ongoing.

This particular implementation is not what you're asking for, I know (the list is based on manufacturer claims), but it and similar schemes don't work because the performance of your PMD depends on the rider's body weight, battery charge, and the rider's actions.

In reality you just need a DB with double-entry bookkeeping logic, so that any customer deposit sits in an escrow account (not with NTUC) and any customer withdrawal (in this case, purchasing a plate of food) would trigger a payment to the nominated account of the Hawker. You could easily set this up to be near-real time, however I don't see the point - it would cost less in bank transaction fees to sum the customer withdrawals on a daily/weekly/monthly basis (maybe let the hawker decide - as I'm sure they bear the bank fees but also need the cashflow) and send a batch payment.

> A large Oriental Pied Hornbill was spotted recently by a nature lover apparently toying with a smaller bird.

> Shaking smaller bird

> The photo was taken by a Mothership reader on Nov. 15 when she was birdwatching at Pasir Ris Park.

> She suddenly heard some noise coming from the trees, when she spotted five hornbills flying around.

> One of the hornbills was carrying something yellow in its beak. The reader subsequently realised that it was actually another bird — a Black-naped Oriole.

> According to her, the hornbill was ""shaking the poor bird as it went"".

> However, she left before ascertaining if the hornbill ate or released the smaller bird in the end.

> Here's a photo of the incident, showing the oriole dangling upside down from the hornbill's beak.

> Omnivorous creatures

> Hornbills are certainly pretty to look at, and a sizeable population now exists in Singapore after the reintroduction of a pair of captive-bred individuals to the wild in 2008.

> Now, they are not an uncommon sight, even at urban areas.

> In 2018, a viral video of a hornbill prying open a bird cage and devouring the small songbird within shocked many.

> This however, is not out of the norm for the species.

> Hornbills are omnivorous, and while they mostly munch on fruits like figs, they also hunt small animals like snakes, baby birds, eggs and lizards.

> Other hornbill shenanigans

> Totally unrelated but follow and listen to our podcast here

We have 2 paths. One for pedestrians, one for cars. PMD don't belong to either. Letting them on either will only caused accidents.

1366,18,f16nnja,t1_f16kero,"With regards to road tax, that's not the right way to go. Bicycles also don't pay road tax, but can still use the roads. On top of that, the larger and heavier the vehicle the more they generally pay in road tax. Motorcycles don't pay much. Cars pay more, but not much in comparison to heavy trucks.

If you see road tax as a way to pay for the damage and wear **you** cause to the road, the system makes more sense.

If we go to the very basics of road engineering there is a unit called ESAL, equivalent standard axle load. Your road will have a design lifespan of a certain number ESALs, after which you'll need to repair it. You convert any vehicle to an ESAL equivalent, and if you know the traffic composition you can compute your design life from that.

Thing is, the formula to compute your ESAL uses mass of the vehicle to the power 4 (Empirically derived by a US agency called AASHTO who did extensive testing). Vehicle weight plays a huge role.

As a simplified example; Take a 200kg motorcycle and a 1000kg car. If we compare their masses to the power 4 like: (1000^4 / 200^4 ) we get 625. This means 1 car driving across a stretch of road causes as much damage as if 625 motorcycles passes that same stretch. If we instead take a PMD at an estimated 80kg for rider+PMD, the same check tells you 24400 PMDs need to ride over a stretch of road for them to make as much damage as 1 car rolling over that stretch once. 

It gets a little bit more complex for larger vehicles because the number of axles need to be considered, but PMDs, motorcycles and cars all have the same number of axles.

Not saying PMDs shouldn't still be regulated and restricted, but road tax is not the way to go.",t3_d81huq,23-09-2019

> SINGAPORE: Five suspected drug offenders were arrested and a variety of drugs and weapons were seized by the Central Narcotics Buereau (CNB) in an operation on Monday (Feb 12). 

> CNB said in a news release on Tuesday that about 427g of heroin, 409g of Ice, 101 ecstasy tablets and 22 Erimin-5 tablets worth more than S$74,000 were seized. The drugs were enough to feed more than 400 abusers for a week, said authorities. 

> Four parangs and a baton were also recovered. 

>        The drugs and cash seized by CNB in the operation. (Photo: CNB)   

> The first three suspects - two Singaporean males and one Malaysian male - were arrested at a petrol kiosk along Pasir Ris Drive 1, where they met up. 

> About 227g of heroin and 253g of Ice were found in the car of the two Singaporeans, aged 27 and 28, while 6g of heroin, a small amount of Ice, the drug paraphernalia and S$7,500 in cash were seized from the 28-year-old Malaysian and his Malaysia-registered motorcycle. 

> CNB officers then raided the residence of the 27-year-old Singaporean at Pasir Ris Drive 3, where they forced their way in after occupants within the unit refused to open the door despite repeated warnings. 

> Two Singaporean females aged 24 and 29 were arrested in the unit. The younger woman was found hiding inside a cupboard. 

> About 194g of heroin, 154g of Ice, 101 Ecstasy tablets and 22 Erimin-5 tablets were recovered from the unit, as well as two digital weighing scales. The weapons were also found in the unit. 

> Investigations into the drug activities of all the suspects are ongoing, said CNB.

> SINGAPORE: The engineer in charge of two SMRT employees killed on the job in March 2016 was sentenced to four weeks’ jail on Monday (Mar 12).

> Lim Say Heng, 48, pleaded guilty to one charge of causing death by negligence. He could have been jailed for up to two years and fined.

> Lim, who had worked for SMRT since 1999, was in charge of a 15-man team tasked with investigating a possible signaling fault between Tampines and Pasir Ris MRT stations on Mar 22, 2016.

> Instead of taking a train to the work site as required under safety guidelines, Lim led the team onto a walkway parallel to the track to proceed to the work site on foot and without warning incoming trains.

> The only safety measure attempted was a handwritten note put up at Tampines MRT station, but it did not indicate to train drivers that there were workmen on the track ahead.

> The men reached the work site about 190 metres from Pasir Ris MRT station shortly after 11am. Lim stepped off the walkway and onto the track at 11.05am.

> Employees in the control room monitoring train movements saw Lim step onto the track, and that a train was approaching.

> An employee radioed the team, but there was no response. He then exited the control room and shouted at the men to get off the track.

> Lim heard the shouting and jumped off the track to safety.

> Trainees Nasrulhudin Najumudin, 25, and Muhammad Asyraf Ahmad Buhari, 24, were directly behind Lim and had stepped off the walkway too, following the engineer’s lead.

> It was their first time on the track, and their last. The men were hit by the oncoming train, which was travelling at a speed of up to 80km/h.

> They were pronounced dead at the scene.

> Lim was [sacked](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/2-smrt-staff-including-train-driver-sacked-over-fatal-pasir-ris--7830336) – along with the driver of the train that killed the men – months after the accident, which remains SMRT&apos;s worst fatal rail incident.

> ""HIS CAREER HAS GONE TO SHAMBLES"": DEFENCE

> On Monday, defence lawyer Lee May Ling argued that a fine of S$10,000 – the maximum amount – would be fair. “He was not solely responsible for the implementation of safety protocols … (and) was not the only person who had failed to abide (by them)”, Ms Lee told the court.

> She pointed to “systemic failures” at SMRT to enforce safety rules. “There were multiple points of responsibility, at least from the fact of the multiple parties charged and convicted,” Ms Lee said.

> Train operator SMRT and its director of control operations Teo Wee Kiat [were charged](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/smrt-director-among-those-charged-over-fatal-train-accident-7652686) alongside Lim in December 2016. 

> The company had also been ordered to pay a [record fine of S$400,000](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/smrt-fined-s-400-000-for-safety-lapses-leading-to-fatal-accident-7616972). It was convicted under the Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA) for failing to do the necessary to ensure the safety and health of its employees at work.

> At a hearing in February 2017, the prosecutor said the accident took place “against the backdrop of an inexcusable systemic failure to ensure … strict compliance with (safety guidelines)”.

> The prosecutor lambasted the Operations Control Centre – directed by Teo – for “giving the green light to employees (to work) in clear contravention of (safety guidelines)”.

> Teo was [fined S$55,000](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/smrt-trains-director-fined-s-55-000-for-fatal-pasir-ris-track-9263332) in September 2017 after he pleaded guilty to the same charge under the WSHA. The prosecutor had said Teo knew safety protocols were regularly ignored, but did nothing to remedy the situation.

> At the time of his sentencing last year, Teo was still working for SMRT and was credited with implementing stricter protocols governing track access during traffic hours.

> Ms Lee, Lim’s lawyer, urged the court to keep in mind the price Lim has already paid for his negligence. “His career has gone to shambles”, Ms Lee said, and Lim struggles to provide for his wife, children as well as his elderly parents who are unwell.

> “Above all, (Lim) has paid the price of his negligence by having to face the fact every day that Nasrulhudin and Asyraf have lost their lives”, she added.

> Even the maximum fine of S$10,000 would be harsh punishment for Lim, argued his lawyer. “The effects of a financial penalty on an organisation like SMRT and a well-paid director like (Teo) completely differ from the effect of a financial penalty on a man like (Lim)”, she told the court.

> But District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt said Lim’s failure to check that safety protocols had been followed that day was the “most proximate and direct cause of death”. As such, a jail term is warranted, the judge said.

> A coroner’s inquiry into the deaths of Nasrulhudin and Asyraf is expected to take place.

I would probably swerve left as well as its natural to swerve towards the direction of less/no traffic.




>Imagine doing that on the highway with motorbikes lane splitting.

Firstly, motorcyclist aren't taught to lane split as it's dangerous.

Secondly, from my observation and experience as a rider, motorcyclist don't usually lane split on the leftmost lane unless they're turning left

",t3_a93vtk,24-12-2018
1522,18,ecgccwb,t1_ecgbdm1,"Thanks for highlighting green is mod status. 

Why I feel this way is I because I have come across some cyclists who had blocked public buses with children going to school and adults late for work. They cycle right in the centre of the bus lane and taking their own sweet time. The bus had to crawl behind the cyclist and that defeats the purpose of having a bus lane. Do you know how excruciatingly painful it feels to be a passenger on one of the buses behind these asshole? It's like having your appendix removed without anaesthesia.

Actually, this is not true. If you look at the video again, there is an increasingly widening gap between the camera (the car in front) and the cyclists. This is because the cyclists cannot keep up with the traffic. Of course, that’s because they cannot accelerate from stop at the speed of a motorized vehicle. Hence, they will always be slowing down moving traffic. 

In fact, if you look at the video again, (the one posted by roads.sg and reposted on the mothership website), they have to digitally zoom in even before the cyclist hits the mirror. You can see this from the limits/edge of video changing. 

Also, not only was the cyclist holding up the lane of the lorry, he was holding up the lane beside it too. If you look at the video again, the lorry tried to keep right to give space to the cyclist and attempt an overtake. In doing so, he ate into the right lane as well, causing the red vehicle to slow down as they were too close to each other. Meanwhile, you can see the car in front of that red car being able to move quickly out of frame as its path is not blocked. This car’s speed is on par with the video car’s speed. This shows the usual speed of the road without anyone hogging it. 

So in summary: not only were the cyclists not able to keep up with traffic, they were blocking the road and slowing down not just one but two lanes of traffic. ",t3_a93vtk,25-12-2018

Yet all this arguing is beside the point. The lorry is way too close to the cyclist. He is driving unsafely. The cyclist then does one thing he certainly should not have done, to hit the car.

When they start slowing down for the traffic lights, it is natural to take the center of the lane. When you stop at a light it does not matter if the bike is in the middle, he is blocking no one. The point of taking the center here is so that you can start again when the light is green. If the lane is narrow, and you have a car right next to you, it is hard to start biking since initially your side-to-side stability is worse. You therefore take the center such that you can start to accelerate and not create potentially dangerous situations. Then after the light he starts to go left to follow his friend, but the lorry driver cannot wait for this to happen and starts to dangerously overtake. At the point of collision, they are going almost as fast as the car in front.

They indeed cannot accelerate as fast, but at the time of overtaking they are almost as fast as the car in front.

They only zoom in in the replay. There is always a bit of rubbernecking after a light.

In what world is the lorry trying to give space? He is trying to squeeze past without having the room. The cyclist is not blocking two lanes, the lorry is. The cyclist cannot be held responsible for the lorry's dangerous overtaking. 


Additionally, after the light he is moving to his left to let the lorry pass. He does not do this immediately, because the road narrows down after the traffic light, so he is trying to maintain a line towards the left edge of the road after the narrowing down. This is to avoid a dangerous squeeze situation later. Unfortunately the lorry cannot wait for this and then goes way too close when overtaking.

>So in summary: not only were the cyclists not able to keep up with traffic, they were blocking the road and slowing down not just one but two lanes of traffic.

Ridiculous to blame the cyclists for the lorry's actions. If he just had a little more patience none of this would have been an issue. Instead he recklessly endangered someone else's life just because he did not want to waste 15-20 seconds. ",t3_a93vtk,25-12-2018

Not to mention that the lorry had the intention to change lane just to overtake, with the taxi slowing down to let the lorry cut into his lane. Instead, the cyclist chose to keep close to the lorry so that he can take a swing at the lorry, causing the incident.

He was clearly stable after accelerating and could have panned to the utmost left with ease by the time the lorry tried to cut into the taxi's lane. He didn't and chose to hit the lorry. If he had politely panned more to the left, the lorry would have cut into the taxi's lane and nothing would have happened. Ask yourself this, if after accelerating, he had ride along the yellow lines like his partner did, would he be able to hit the lorry? 

There is also the part cyclist has no intention of letting vehicles overtake him by riding in such a manner (side by side), before or after the traffic light. Forcing the first vehicle(the one with the video) to overtake by changing lanes. From his previous encounter, i see no reason to believe that he is moving towards the yellow lines during the incident. Correct me if im wrong, but i do not believe i saw cyclist watch his left to see how much space he has left to go, he seems only to be interested in maintaining the position between himself and the lorry that would allow him to take a proper swing to dislodge the mirror. Apart from that, i also saw the lorry jerk, possibly due to braking. If i take that into account, the cyclist (who didn't need to brake), would not be close enough to hit the lorry unless he himself slowed down to do so.

> “I never forget a friend. I never forget him and I know that he is a man who has helped many people,” said Dr Tan.

> “When I was in need, when nobody came to help me, he was the one who came to help me,” he continued. “In life, never forget good friends.”

> Speaking to the media in a separate doorstop, Lim said he had helped “many parties” when they did not know how to fill in nomination forms, or could not obtain assentors, proposers, or seconders for Nomination Day.

> Lim described Dr Tan as a “true friend”. “The fact that he is present here is good enough to show that there's true friendship”, he said.

> SDA has been in the Pasir Ris area caring for residents for 13 years, according to Lim.

> Asked about his chance for the 10 July GE, Lim rated it as “very good”, saying that SDA has stepped up providing its community services in the past five years. “And people here know us, even with a half mask they can recognise me,” he said.

> SINGAPORE: A senior constituency manager at the Residents' Committees (RCs) of two zones in Pasir Ris reused payment vouchers from one of his zones to claim cash from the vice-chairman of the other zone.

> He lied to the vice-chairman of Pasir Ris Zone 8 that he had used his own money to pay vendors and wanted reimbursement, and received four cheques amounting to S$5,919.27 for invoices already paid for by Pasir Ris Zone 7.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> For his crimes, 37-year-old Li Xuanwei was sentenced on Thursday (Jul 16) to 12 weeks' jail. He pleaded guilty to two counts of cheating, with another two charges taken into consideration.

> He is no longer with the RC.

> The court heard that Li joined the People's Association in March 2008 as a constituency manager, and later became a senior constituency manager at the RCs of Pasir Ris Zone 7 and Zone 8.

> In October 2015, the Housing and Development Board (HDB), along with Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council and its RCs embarked on a neighbourhood renewal programme to improve amenities in its precincts.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> This programme was fully funded by the Government and implemented by the town council, the court heard.

> As the programme required the support of at least 75 per cent of the residents, the RCs of Pasir Ris Zones 7 and 8 were tasked with organising an event to explain the programme to residents and garner their votes.

> Li was tasked to organise a one-day event on Mar 3, 2018. He engaged the vendors, prepared payment vouchers and cheques with supporting documents, and presented them to the RC chairman of Pasir Ris Zone 7.

> After the chairman signed the cheques, Li made payments to the vendors. However, he reused these payment vouchers with supporting invoices and receipts and made fraudulent claims from the RC vice-chairman of Zone 8, Mr Rajeev Divakaran Nair.

> He deceived Mr Rajeev into believing that he had used his own cash to pay the vendors and so needed reimbursement.

> He tricked Mr Rajeev at Pasir Ris Zone 8 RC on Apr 19, 2018, claiming that he had paid S$504 for sculpting balloons and S$1,016 for bags. Mr Rajeev believed him and gave him a sum of S$1,521.

> A few months later on Jul 4, 2018, Li again cheated Mr Rajeev by saying he had paid S$2,199 for unspecified expenses for the programme, and received this sum as a ""reimbursement"".

> FRAUD UNCOVERED AFTER AUDIT

> The fraud was uncovered by the constituency director of Pasir Ris East Constituency Office in August 2018 after an internal audit was conducted of the accounts.

> He confronted Li, who admitted to cheating Pasir Ris Zone 8 by recycling invoices that had already been paid by Pasir Ris Zone 7.

> Li made full restitution to Pasir Ris Zone 8 on Aug 10, 2018, and the constituency director lodged a police report later that year.

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Yen Seow sought at least 15 weeks' jail, noting that Li had committed ""premeditated offences against a public institution"".

> He said the RC exists for the public good and serves to promote the welfare of its residents, relying on ""limited public funds to deliver its mission"".

> ""The accused played a critical role in safeguarding and ensuring the judicious use of these funds,"" said Mr Tan. ""Despite knowing this, the accused saw it fit to abuse his longstanding position of trust and authority in the RC by diverting $5,919.27 of such public funds to himself.""

> In doing so, Li defrauded not only the chairman and vice-chairman of the RC, but also all the residents under the RC’s purview, said Mr Tan.

> ""Such dishonest conduct strikes at the heart of the RC’s mission and tarnishes the good reputation of other officers in a similar capacity as the accused,"" he added.

> Such crimes are difficult to detect, as shown by the fact that four such scams went undetected for about five months, said the prosecutor.

> He noted that Li had pleaded guilty. For each charge of cheating, Li could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined.

> CNA has contacted the People's Association and Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council for comment.

> He may live in the corner unit of a Housing Board (HDB) block in Pasir Ris, but getting to the lift lobby for Mr H.Q. is like walking through an overgrown garden.

> The 20-year-old, who would give only the initials of his name, lives next to what neighbours have nicknamed ""the jungle house"".

> Rows of leafy plants are crammed pot-to-pot in the common space in front of the eighth-floor unit in Block 101 Pasir Ris Street 6.

> When The Straits Times visited yesterday, there were about 40 tall potted plants lining the walkway. A woman in her late 40s, who did not want to be identified, was seen watering the plants and trimming leaves.

> Neighbours say the large collection of plants is an obstruction and a fire hazard. ""The plants have been like this for the past eight to nine years,"" said a neighbour who lives in a maisonette below the ""garden"" and who declined to be named. He said he sometimes has to trim the creepers growing on the balcony of the eighth-floor unit that reach down to his window. The plants also attract red ants, which come into his unit.

> ""The other neighbours and I have approached (the resident of the eighth-floor flat) directly in the past and the town council has contacted her, but nothing much has changed,"" said the neighbour, who is in his mid-60s. ""The number of plants has reduced recently, though.""

> The owner has told ST that she has not been approached by her neighbours, and that if they had done so, she would have been accommodating and made changes.

> An eighth-floor neighbour, Mr Lee, 67, who declined to give his full name, said cleaners occasionally help to remove some of the plants. He said the owner has been tending to the plants diligently every morning for many years and that only the units near the corner are affected.

> Mr H.Q. and his family have few complaints about the plants growing beside their doorstep. ""The owner maintains the plants so that they don't grow into our area,"" he said, adding that the owner is a keen gardener averse to killing the plants because of her religious beliefs.

> Related Story 7 fridges along Simei corridor: Other unusual items spotted in HDB corridors

> Related Story Mannequin on Clementi HDB ledge gets to stay for Christmas after town council gives nod

> But he admits that they pose a safety hazard and are difficult to navigate if he is holding large items.

> A spokesman for Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council said it has advised the owner several times not to place too many potted plants in the common area. But while she would remove some of them, she often returns them to the common area later.

> The spokesman added that while the town council understands the resident's desire to create a high-rise garden city, it ""would like to reiterate the importance for residents to maintain obstruction-free passageways. This will create a safe living environment for all"".

People who don't bother to carry or too lazy to carry one are also unlikely to return it. Not because they want to steal it but to them returning it is bothersome. 

Its the same reason why supermarket trolleys in many countries require a dollar coin to be slotted in for its use and that coin can be retrieved when you return the trolley to the trolley lane. The trolley is worth much much more but the coin deposit encourages the return of the trolley. 

Do a rack that releases an umbrella on receiving a physical or digital token as a deposit. That would address the issue. 

The same logic is applied when roads have clearly marked lanes rather than no markings at all. We all accept that road must have lane markings but we can't seem to think thru how to execute the umbrella sharing scheme. 101 in all Business schools of repute.

> SINGAPORE - After years of waiting, Pasir Ris Town finally got its first hawker centre - and it&apos;s a place that offers traditional and hipster cuisine at affordable prices, as well as a taste of the arts and music.

> Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre, which officially opened on Thursday (Jan 25), has 770 seats with 42 stalls on two floors and overlooks Pasir Ris Park.

> Twenty stalls on the ground floor sell popular local dishes, while 22 stalls on the second floor offer cuisine such as rice bowls with wagyu beef and Thai boat noodles.

> Visitors can also attend events at the hawker centre such as art markets, craft fairs and music gigs. A kids&apos; area is also in the works.

> Pasir Ris resident Yu Li Li, 50, who was among the patrons at the hawker centre on Thursday morning, said: ""I&apos;ve lived in Pasir Ris since 1999 and this is our first hawker centre. It&apos;s well worth the wait.""

> ""It&apos;s really the ideal place for me. It&apos;s not cramped like a restaurant, and I get to sit next to nature. The food is cheap too, even on the second floor,"" said Ms Li, an education coach at MindChamps.

> The hawker centre is managed by NTUC Foodfare, a social enterprise tasked with keeping meals healthy and affordable for Singaporeans.

> At least two dishes at every stall will be labelled as budget meals - offering patrons affordable and quality food, said NTUC Foodfare. Budget meal prices at the stalls on the first level cost a maximum of $2.80, but prices will vary at the hipster stalls.

> Healthier meals under 500 calories are also offered, marked with the Healthier Choice symbol by the Health Promotion Board (HPB).

> The hawker centre also features centralised dishwashing and common crockery systems. Diners will also have to clear their own trays.

> Cashless payment service is available. Diners can use their Plus! cards, Plus! Pay or DBS Paylah! on the mobile application Foodfare. 

> By mid-2018, they can order food via the app - wherever they are - and collect it from the hawker centre, said an NTUC Foodfare spokesman.

> The hawker centre is the third one managed by NTUC Foodfare, after Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre and Kampung Admiralty Hawker Centre.

> It was originally scheduled to open in late 2017, but the installation of the gas supply took longer than expected, causing the delay.

> The hawker centre provides an opportunity in entrepreneurship for aspiring hipster hawkers like Ms Cheryl Tan, 24.

> Ms Cheryl Tan, owner of Tasty Street, holding a bowl of Iberico lor bak from her stall which costs $6.50. ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI

> After working as a pastry chef in hotels and restaurants for more than three years, she quit her job and set up a stall with two friends from her culinary course at Temasek Polytechnic.

> Their stall Tasty Street sells donburi - fusion rice bowls with ingredients like wagyu beef, deep fried tofu and sous vide chicken breast.

> They are beneficiaries of the ""hawker-preneurship"" programme that offers help in the form of funds, branding advice and equipment management training by NTUC Foodfare.

> ""We graduated and decided to part ways to learn different cuisines, from Thai to French cuisines. Our main goal now... is to bring our background on premium food, and translate that into food for the masses,"" said Ms Tan.

> That is good news for residents like Ms Li.

> ""We were sad for many years about not having a hawker centre. And today, the answer is finally given to us.""

> SINGAPORE - National Parks Board (NParks) officers are looking into the cause of hundreds of fish deaths along a stretch of beach in Pasir Ris.

> The silver-coloured fish, as well as several crabs, were spotted washed up at Pasir Ris Park on Monday morning (Feb 3).

> Three cleaners were seen along the approximately 150m stretch of shoreline clearing the dead animals into large bags at about 8am.

> NParks coastal and marine director at the National Biodiversity Centre Karenne Tun said that based on preliminary findings, the fish were mostly of the Hilsa kelee species, which is part of the cluepid family of wild fish found in Singapore's coastal waters.

> ""NParks officers did not observe any dead fish or biodiversity along the surrounding coastal areas along Changi Beach, East Coast Park and Pulau Ubin, including Chek Jawa,"" said Dr Tun.

> There were also no reports of fish deaths at the nearby fish farms, she added.

> NParks officers will continue to monitor the coastal beaches for anomalies and look into the cause of the fish deaths.

> In April last year, thousands of fish died in the waters near Lim Chu Kang jetty and in nearby fish farms.

> Fish farmers in the area sent motorboats out to remove and dispose of the dead fish that had surfaced in the sea.

> The warmer weather was said to be the likely cause, as higher temperatures could have resulted in a lack of oxygen in the water.

> There was also a mass fish death in 2015, when around 600 tonnes of fish died in a span of two weeks due to a plankton bloom.

> A bloom happens when plankton multiply rapidly due to warmer temperatures in the water. Plankton suck oxygen from the water.

>SINGAPORE - A decorative structure on a Housing Board block in Pasir Ris fell from a height of at least eight storeys on Monday morning (June 18).

>The incident at Block 270 Pasir Ris Street 21 startled Ms Ye Ruoshi, who was feeding her three-month-old daughter at around 11am when she heard a loud crash that sounded like thunder.

>""At first I thought it was thunder because it was drizzling, but it was such a loud crashing sound that we thought maybe something fell,"" the 45-year-old artist told The Straits Times.

>The sound was so loud that it startled her daughter, who began to cry.

>Ms Ye, who lives with her parents, went to her window to investigate the source of the noise, and saw neighbours pointing towards the block opposite her flat, she told ST.

>""Thank God nobody was downstairs at the time,"" said Ms Ye, who also has three sons. She added that she took photos of the fallen structure to warn her children.

>Within an hour, she saw police officers arriving at the scene to cordon off the area with tape.

>At around 3pm, Pasir Ris-Punggol MP Zainal Sapari posted on Facebook about the incident, saying that there was no injury.

>He added that police and the town council's representatives are at the site, along with officers from the Housing Board's technical department.

>""Cause of damage is still under investigation,"" he added.

>The Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council and HDB told ST that they were informed about the incident at noon on Monday. 

>A spokesman said: ""The panel is part of the façade design and is non-structural. The building is structurally safe."" 

>She added that the town council will be repairing the damage as well as taking additional precautions by checking neighbouring blocks with similar features.

> The town council has also cleared the debris and cordoned off the area beneath the affected facade.

>Ms Ye told ST that a similar incident with a covered walkway in the estate occurred earlier this year. Part of the roof fell from the linkway, leaving a hole that has yet to be repaired, she said.

>In September 2016, a concrete sunshade was partially dislodged from a Housing Board flat in Tampines. It was later found that there were no rebars on the side of the sunshade that dislodged, following an investigation by a professional engineer engaged by the Tampines Town Council. 

>By late October that year, it was reported that parts of housing blocks have fallen off on at least three occasions over the past two months.

Slowly back away from the wild boar. 

If you have time, try to reach higher ground such as a boulder, car, possibly even climb a tree. But please consider that this might be hard to apply due to the closeness and speed of a wild boar surprise charge.

When attacked, keep your footing. Try sidestepping quickly to avoid being swung by its tusks.

If all the above fails, fight back with whatever available at hand (sticks, your bare hands, a knife?) until mauling ends.

Even when attacked, try to keep your standing position by all means as you can suffer greater injuries once down.

> Mr Sharael shared his experience ""working with cutting-edge technologies"" in cars, oil rigs, aircraft engines and factories across the world. Speaking about the rise of the digital economy and the expected changes to the industries as they evolve, he said he wants to work with residents to help them develop the right skillsets and create good jobs.

> Mr Puthucheary rounded off the speeches by reiterating Pasir Ris' ""extensive rejuvenation exercise"" and Punggol's ongoing growth.

> SDA chairman Desmond Lim spoke in Mandarin, while secretary-general Abu Mohamed spoke in Malay.

> Another new face, electrical engineer Kuswadi Atnawi, said the SDA is contesting in these ""trying times"" to deny the incumbent the majority in Parliament, so that ""they would not pass any Bill or any policies that will cause more strain to our lives and livelihoods"".

> ""Touch your heart, ask yourself – 'Why, why did they do this to call for an election at such an irresponsible time?'"" he said. ""Shouldn’t the Government be focusing on helping people succeed? Instead, it wants to put your lives at risk. But what is done is done.""

> He also spoke of how ""there are people who laugh at us"". SDA contested in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC in the last three elections but has never won, and chairman Mr Lim was criticised for his command of English in 2015.

> ""They say - 'Why not give up, since you lost before.' And we say the SDA will never give up,"" said Mr Singh. ""And the simple reason is: We have walked the ground in Pasir Ris-Punggol for 13 years. We feel the pain of the bad policies.""

> If elected, the party will challenge the Government to return CPF in full at retirement age, use an extra 1 per cent of GDP to help poor families, tighten immigration controls and enact fair labour policies as well as stop ""irresponsible spending on extravagant government projects"".

> SINGAPORE - A lorry driver who was seen in a viral video having an altercation with a cyclist was sentenced to seven weeks' jail and fined $500 on Tuesday (Jan 14).

> Teo Seng Tiong, 59, was also disqualified from driving for two years.

> His lawyer, Mr Chia Boon Teck, told the court that his client, a Singaporean, intended to appeal.

> Teo had earlier been convicted of causing hurt to cyclist Eric Cheung Hoyu as well as for failing to report an accident to the police within 24 hours.

> The video of the incident, which occurred at the junction of Pasir Ris Drive 3 and Pasir Ris Rise just before noon on Dec 22, 2018, garnered more than three million views online.

> On Tuesday, the court heard that Teo had previous convictions for voluntarily causing hurt in 1988 and 2012, and was convicted for affray in 1999. He was also convicted for an obscene act in 1993 and insulting the modesty of a woman in 2007.

> He also had multiple traffic offences involving careless driving, speeding and beating a red light between 1999 and 2015.

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Gabriel Choong called for the court to sentence Teo to 10 weeks' jail and a fine of $500. The DPP also called for him to be disqualified from driving for three years. The defence pleaded with the court to impose a fine for both of Teo's charges.

> In remarks during sentencing, District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt said he was unable to agree with the defence for a fine on the more serious charge of causing hurt by rash driving.

> He added that the sentence called by the prosecution also did not give ""sufficient consideration to the deliberate actions of the cyclist... in breaking the lorry side mirror in the incident"".

> But the judge also said that the reaction of the accused thereafter was ""disproportionate"".

> Related Story Lorry driver caught in Pasir Ris viral video convicted of causing hurt to cyclist by rash act

> Related Story Lorry driver in viral video says he swerved in direction of cyclist to avoid taxi

> In the video, Mr Cheung is seen hitting the left side mirror of Teo's lorry.

> The lorry then suddenly swerved to the left towards Mr Cheung, who fell off his bicycle and onto the grass verge on the side of the road.

> Both Mr Cheung and Teo were later arrested within three days of the accident.

> Mr Cheung pleaded guilty to committing mischief and causing obstruction by riding his bicycle in the middle of the lane instead of the leftmost side, and was fined $2,800 on April 12 last year.

> Teo, who contested the two charges, was found guilty last month by Judge Chay, who found that the lorry driver had ""deliberately swerved"" his vehicle into the cyclist.

> The verdict came after a four-day trial, which saw several parties involved in the accident taking the stand, including Teo and Mr Cheung.

> During the trial, Teo testified that he was attempting to overtake two cyclists - one of whom was Mr Cheung - when he heard the sound of ""something breaking"".

> Thinking that he had hit a taxi on his right, Teo said he then reacted in the moment by swerving to his left, in the direction of Mr Cheung, a British national.

> Teo had also said that he was not unhappy that his side mirror had been broken as ""it only costs $15"".

> This was disputed by the second cyclist in the accident, Mr Nigel Harper, who told the court that Teo appeared upset and quite angry at Mr Cheung, and was pointing at the broken mirror repeatedly.

> For acting rashly to cause hurt, Teo could have been jailed up to a year and fined up to $5,000. For failing to report an accident to the police within 24 hours, he could have been jailed up to three years or fined up to $1,000 as a first offender.

i still don't get why don't they allow the scooters be onto the rode. People will scoot safer if they fear for their lives.",t3_b2e7fm,18-03-2019
1922,18,eishdg4,t1_eis67vq,"Agreed, it's the small group that ruins the fun/convenience for the majority.   

The problem was legislation and licensing which had to catch up with the technology. Remember when ride hailing first came about? Rules were so arbitrary then that LTA had to step up their game to regulate the industry.  

The thing is drivers generally try to follow the Road Traffic Act. Number 1 -- they're afraid of fines, number 2 -- license banned means end of livelihood/convenience.  

For escooters, there's no ""riders license"" so to speak. So this small group of YP just do what they want. And when LTA catches them and enforce, they start to cry foul and say they're being victimised of their livelihood.  

So many people with escooters follow the rules and speed limit. But every now and then you'll have a joker who rides his dualtron in the middle of the road. ",t3_b2e7fm,18-03-2019

Either that, or that's the low-level alert, where the feed water isn't filling into the tank quick enough for the minimum level set by TC.

Forgot lol, too long ago

I think it's the low-level one. Because high level they got a physical hole for the water to flow out from the top of the tanks, so just waste water lor, no need to alarm since small matter.

But imagine low level, then suddenly people wake up in the morning want to bathe and shit but no water. Fuckin gg.

If no queue, quite alright. Not many seats also. Let the craze die down and can check it out again.

Promising - the western hot plate stall.  Prawn noodle with sio bak. Soup shop.

Ice cream was quite ex for a hawker though. 

Limiting my comments to second floor only. The first floor is your usual Neighbourhood hawker with no stand out stalls.",t3_7vvrip,07-02-2018
