77,4,g2uzzne,t3_igoj9v,"There used to be a railway branching off from Bukit Timah to Jurong/Tuas area. It opened in 1960s to much fanfare since back then, there was no AYE and transport was very bad. 

Unfortunately, the line failed to live up to its intended purpose and was closed in 1990s and abandoned since. 

An acquaintance of mine who works in KTM and knew a few of the Tanjong Pagar-era rail staff told me that when a train derailed near Bukit Timah in 2010 (a year before the railway closed), the engineers and repairmen went to the abandoned railway, dismantled some rails, and used those rails to repair the damaged track.

You notice a pamphlet on the floor with Communist propaganda written in a language you can't understand. Strange. 'I thought communism died long ago.' In the sea of Chinese characters, you notice a number-""1953"". 

On the other side you see a young couple with their young son out on a picnic, enjoying the afternoon breeze under tree cover. They wear clothing of a bygone era and speak with an unusual accent. Seeing the confused expression on your face, the man heartily greets you and invites you to eat with them. 

You notice that the man's notebook is filled with crude sketches of a circle and a lightning bolt going through it. How unusual. 

The young man introduces himself as Harry and shares his aspiration of starting his law firm and joining politics. With a surprised but subdued feeling, you wryly joke with the man that both him and his year old son will lead this territory out of the hands of the British and into one of the most developed countries in Asia, even surpassing her colonial master.

You can see some post-restoration interior photos [here](https://thelongnwindingroad.wordpress.com/tag/jurong-railway-line/), which show that the wooden sleepers have been replaced with concrete ones and gravel laid down on the tunnel floor to presumably prevent flooding.

Hopefully they preserve the bridges across Sunset Way and Sungei Ulu Pandan as well to give the Jurong Line the recognition it deserves.

> ""Both of us are very open to each other,"" she said. They would spend at least four hours on Saturdays talking about Kathy&apos;s student life, lectures, friends and even potential suitors. 

> ""She always asked me to evaluate those guys who are interested in her, and she&apos;ll listen to my opinion. She told me clearly that she told guys &apos;no&apos;, if mummy said no,"" Mrs Ong said.

> The mother and daughter were so close that they shared the same closet. Mrs Ong said that Kathy was so careful about spending money that she would first check out her mother&apos;s closet whenever she needed new clothes. 

> ""Today I feel so bad. They told me to bring her favourite shoe and I realised that she doesn&apos;t have a favourite shoe because all the events that she attended, she wore my shoes,"" Mrs Ong said.

> ""I was just telling her last week that &apos;in your school holidays, you need to shop for a proper shoe&apos;. The ones that she&apos;s wearing now, those are still my shoes,"" she added. 

> Kathy told her mother that when she got her first job, she would bring her grandfather to Australia, which is her favourite country, for a holiday at her own expense, Mrs Ong said. 

> She also added that Kathy cared deeply for her family - to the point that she would ""care for me more like I&apos;m her daughter and she&apos;s the mother"". 

> Mrs Ong had donated an organ to her brother and since then, suffered frequently from ill health. She said that her daughter was especially concerned about her mother&apos;s health after the transplant.

> ""She always told me &apos;Mummy you cannot leave me&apos;. She made sure to tell me that I cannot die because she needed me to help her choose her husband and to nurture her children to be like her,"" Mrs Ong said.  

> They shared hugs and kisses often, and Kathy would unabashedly hold her mother&apos;s hand when they were out in public. 

> Her friends took note of Kathy&apos;s care for her family, and said that she always put her family first. ""Everything she has done so far, she always considered her parents at every step she took,"" said a friend at the wake.

> ""She was very torn. She wanted to stay in (at her dormitory) every weekend but she was the only child, so she also wanted to go back (home),"" added another friend, who asked not to be named. 

> ""I CANNOT THINK OF ANY COMMITTEE SHE WASN&apos;T IN"" 

> Kathy was part of Ora House under NUS’s Tembusu College and actively participated in student activities as part of the house committee. 

> The accident happened when Kathy was headed to Clementi with three other committee members to buy take-away dinner for an Ora House gathering. They were celebrating and bidding farewell to seniors from the house of about 130 students. 

> Her friends and professors said that Kathy took part in everything from performance arts, science and organising events to develop bonds among her Ora House peers. She participated in about five or six student body committees. 

> Master of the college Gregory Clancey described Kathy as “unusually active"" compared with most students and was keen to volunteer her time in many student groups.

> “She joined a lot of different groups, she was interested in so many things. She was in the college’s house committee and bonded the students together. She was very popular, had a lot of friends,” Dr Clancey said at the wake.  

> “She was a serious and yet very cheerful person and that’s why she was always so popular,” he added. Dr Clancey said that the college had arranged transport for about 120 students to go to Kathy’s wake on Friday. More plans are being made for other friends to pay their last respects before the final send-off on Monday.

> Vice Dean for the Faculty of Science Chew Fook Tim said that Kathy was a “people person"". ""She knows them as an individual and a person that she wants to keep contact with,” he said. 

> At NUS, Kathy was pursuing a Bachelor of Environmental Studies and showed an interest in biodiversity. 

> “She has written a lot of blogposts, some for her assignments but she also did more, and it runs right through that she’s really someone who has a cause, someone who has a passion for biodiversity,"" said Dr Chew. 

> Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh, who is also the rector of Tembusu College, said that he remembered Kathy because she had attended his forum twice. 

> “She always came to the forum and was very interested. Even though there were 600 students, she was somebody I remembered having interacted with her. She always appeared and was a very charismatic person,” Professor Koh said. 

> “We’re going to be in grief for a long time as a community,” said Dr Clancey.

Guilty because I knew if it was anyone else I would have treated it as just another statistic. Guilty because I loved my best friend for the exact same reasons I was friends with Kat. She was vibrant, bubbly and caring. 

She was kind and considerate. I didn’t know her as much as I should, but that didn’t stop her from preparing little exam study packages for us. Me, who was a friend of her friend. 

I was in RadioACtive, and on the off chance we were out and about during school events taking photos, the ones with her in it didn’t have to be taken twice.

If there's incoming vehicles, those going straight get right of way. Otherwise if the opposite straight (and similarly pedestrians path is empty) and it is safe to make the turn, you can go ahead.

Looking at the video, it seems like the taxi driver did not make the correct judgement; it is highly likely that his view of the incoming straight traffic is blocked by the car to his left and in front of him. He basically played ""follow the leader"", or ""hey, that other guy is turning. Sure the road is clear one I can turn also."" 

Instead, that other turning guy made the turn on the barest of margins: he knows he is only very just going to clear the turn in time. Anyone who's even slightly slower (e.g. that taxi) would not make it.

(Similarly, it is likely that the guy going straight only saw the taxi at the last moments, the view almost entirely blocked by the first turning car)

Perhaps it is a misunderstanding of ""right of way"", but I believe what you mentioned is more ""this guy can and must go first during [situation], all the others should wait"", rather than ""this guy is allowed to..."" that most in this comment tree is talking about.

Yes, the taxi (and the car before it) can turn right, they're allowed to. No, they do not have ""right of way"" when there's an opposite straight vehicle incoming.

But here's the kicker: The vehicle in front judged he could clear the junction before the incoming vehicle reached him, and he made the turn. In an oddball way, he does have right of way: the junction is ""clear enough"" for him to complete the turn safely.

The vehicle going straight has right of way, and so he maintained his speed with confidence... which as said in most drivers handbooks all over the world, is wrong: you should always slow down when nearing an intersection.

The taxi made a wrong judgement call here (*likely from observing the vehicle in front of him making the turn*) and made the turn himself. In a lot of ways, he is the most in the wrong.

The report from stomp states ' we had asked the resident to scale down the decoration pieces and shift them to a place which is safer for everyone.'

However, the report from ST states ' A Clementi resident has been asked to remove Christmas decorations, including a mannequin, from the ledge outside his second-storey Housing Board flat for safety reasons.'

So the one on stomp says the residents can still have the decorations, but they will have to scale it down and move it to another place. But in ST, they said they were removed outright.

403,4,g63bxib,t3_iwxn9q,"For those who haven't been following what happened:

The Elections Department (ELD) alleged that New Naratif breached the Parliamentary Elections Act (PEA) by publishing five unauthorised paid advertisements related to electoral activities on Facebook during the GE.

The first takedown notice was given on 4th July, a day after their paid advertisement post on 3rd July. New Naratif published the takedown decision, then went on to make four more paid advertisement posts on 7th to 8th July. 

So basically they flouted a law that was clearly stated in the first place. After the first warning, they went on to flout it a further four times, while politicising the takedown notice.

That's all that is being reported so far from [Yahoo](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/police-investigating-new-naratif-for-allegedly-publishing-paid-ads-on-its-site-during-ge-2020-133229644.html), [Mothership](https://mothership.sg/2020/09/new-naratif-condemns-police-report/), [Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-naratif-says-elds-police-report-against-it-is-harassment-against-govts-critics-abuse) and [CNA](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/elections-police-report-new-naratif-advertisement-ge2020-13123242). 

We don't know if New Naratif took down the post after the warning, or if the second batch of paid advertisement posts were scheduled and forgotten in the rush of the GE. 

I assume that the police investigation has to do with finding out the intent of the actions, [since New Naratif themselves failed to address this in their response.](https://newnaratif.com/journalism/new-naratifs-response-to-the-allegations-by-the-singapore-elections-department/)",t3_iwxn9q,21-09-2020

Some important facts:

* New Naratif boosted 13 Facebook posts during the election period, all of which contained elections-related content. Of these 13, only five were ordered to be taken down by the Elections Department. At the time of the first takedown notice, we had five boosted posts running. Since only one was taken down, it is reasonable to assume at the time that the content of the first post was the problem, not the boosting of posts. We did not re-boost that post, but instead boosted posts similar to the four posts which were not taken down, assuming they were okay. We were not informed when the further posts were taken down. So it's not a case of ""doubling down"" -  we simply didn't know at the time.

* Other organisations boosted posts with elections-related content during the election. Those posts were not subject to a takedown order, nor have police reports been filed against them. AsiaOne (a Singaporean media company partly owned by government-controlled Singapore Press Holdings) boosted around 240 posts, of which around 150 were directly related to the elections, during the election period.

* The Prime Minister’s Office did not, at any time, write to New Naratif to inform New Naratif that posts had been taken down, why they had been taken down, or to establish clear guidelines and boundaries as to what constitutes election activity/advertising.

Anyway, for a full timeline, please visit the [webpage](https://newnaratif.com/new-naratif-under-attack/) which includes links to all the relevant boosted posts (both those taken down and not taken down). Thank you!",t3_iwxn9q,26-09-2020

From the dates on the ads, it seems like the initial takedown on 3 July was applied to the parody cologne ad about discretion.

On 4 July, they added 2 ads - ""Transparency and Accountability in Singapore"" and ""The PAP's Destructive Politics""

On 6 July, they added another 2 - a video on ""Why POFMA is devastating in an election"" and ""Racial Discrimination and the Continuing Legacy of Colonialism in Singapore""

*Should* these ads really constitute prohibited election activity/advertising (i.e. regardless of what the law currently says)? Personally, I don't think any of them apart from maybe the one about the PAP's destructive politics really directly deals with election party politics (and even that strikes me as not-unreasonable commentary + advertising of that commentary, given the sentiment at the time regarding Raeesah, Ivan, 10 million etc). The rest are commentaries on laws and systemic issues which might certainly hurt the PAP's chances, but don't really seem to me to deal with electoral politics in the same ""direct"" way.

As for what the law actually says - [ST reports](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/police-investigating-new-naratif-for-allegedly-publishing-illegal-paid-election) that they're being investigated under s 83(2) PEA:

> 83(2) No person shall conduct any election activity unless he is in possession of a written authority signed by a candidate or his election agent in Form 22 or Form 23, as the case may be, in the First Schedule; and such authority shall be issued only on or after the day of nomination.

Did they violate this ""clearly stated"" law by conducting activity for the purpose of ""promoting... the electoral success at any election for one or more identifiable political parties, candidates or group of candidates"" or ""prejudicing the electoral prospects of other political parties, candidates or groups of candidates"" without written authority? Possibly, and I won't comment on this to avoid prejudging the issue.

But it also seems to me that this law *might* cover (and here, a disclaimer, IANAL, this is not legal advice)... well....  a ton of online comments on the election, including on this subreddit. Or perhaps even someone not part of a political party telling their friends/family who to vote for.

Both were about Raeesah. First was about a radically different treatment she received for actual incendiary comments on racial issues and judiciary vs. some ridiculous accusations against Ivan Lim, brought up from 10 or 20 years ago, which involved breach of no laws and were personal in nature. 

Second post about her own self-professed idolization of Angela Davis - and the post itself was about Angela Davis herself.

Now I don't know exactly how any of it is prejudicing any person's electoral chances if it is their own declaration.

Neither of these posts were promoted - not that I could promote them on FB anyway, since the rules for advertising on social and political issues are tight now.

You must surely be living in some sort of a parallel universe to equate running paid ads that accuse a political candidate (the PM) and his party of oppressing opposition, having all the power, money, influence and ""daddy issues"" (sic!) to two posts, one of which was an explanation of who the candidate's idol is and another asking the public why the treatment of two different candidates is so different.

You want to compare that to scandalizing judiciary or peddling lies that authorities in Singapore discriminate non-Chinese and non-white people?

And no, my posts were not meant to alter people's views, but simply to provide a context to what a specific candidate said and what her sympathies are. I think that highlighting someone's devoted passion, described as ""all you need to know about my politics is that I've read everything published by Angela Davis"", to a person who literally has blood on her hands and was entertained by the entire Soviet Block, while defending a vile cult lunatic who led 900 people to kill themselves in a ritual murder-suicide, is a useful piece of reporting.

I'm convinced that if it turned out that one of opposition candidates was found to have committed murder, WP supporters would come after anybody who blew the whistle rather than the disgraced person.

It's always quite marvelous when left wingers are caught doing something outright heinous and they try to deflect by saying ""oh, oh, oh, but that other guy didn't smile at me in 1998!"".

I've never written a thing about WP's people (aside from AHTC case - where I wrote about just that, the case and the details behind it), until Raeesah Khan professed her idolization of a communist decorated by the Soviet Union.

I do not dabble with BS like that. I thought Ivan Lim's case was absolutely shameful regardless of who attacked him - and, by the way, he was actually torn apart by PAP crowd that opposition supporters simply jumped on, exposing their vile tendencies.

But I do think, of course, that left wing ideas are far worse than right wing ideas, since left wing lunacies screw everybody while right wing lunacies usually screw only some people.

Nobody on the left has any arguments based on ""sound logic and facts"" - literally nobody. The entire left is built on the premise of rejection of responsibility for one's actions. If you're going to build everything on a bad idea, then all you come up with will be wrong as well.

People are poor not because of their own poor choices, but because evil corporations and capitalists oppress them somehow. Women do not earn less because they make different educational and career decisions (not to mention are biologically different than men and less inclined to compete and climb the ladder) but because they are somehow discriminated. Ethnic minorities are not responsible for their bad choices, habits or customs, but are victims of oppression of the majority - be it white in America or Chinese in Singapore.

The entire belief system of the left is built on the premise of power struggle and oppression, that is meant to absolve people of responsibility for their own mistakes.

What follows is that ""enlightened"" left-wingers are, obviously, the saviors of those oppressed. The geniuses who have all the answers and know how to right all wrongs, if only given power. And, sadly, they often are given power and then dictate what others should do with their lives, the fruits of their labor, whom they should employ, how much they should pay and all the rest of this drivel.

It doesn't take long for the entire economies to stagnate and societies to gradually crumble under the burden of properly oppressive control which is relabeled under nice names. ""Affirmative action"", ""wealth redistribution"", ""equality"", ""free healthcare and education"" and so on.

As you can see, it quickly stops being about just ""difference of opinion"" and it becomes a dictatorship regarding what you should do, how, when, with whom and what is morally wrong. And, heaven forbid, you dare to voice your criticism of this you're going to be trampled and erased by the angry mob.

It's quite ironic, since left wingers in Singapore often bemoan some imaginary oppression by the government - whose ""censorship"" extends to fact-checks and penalizing race-baiters - and then literally want to obliterate any and everybody they disagree with.

The left is not and has never been about any liberties. Like PJ thum and other clown activists, it has always been about imposing ideological standards by subversive measures rather than by discussion, let alone any rational thought process.

The left always starts with what it believes the world should look like and then wants to force any and everybody to follow the rules or be outcast.",t3_iwxn9q,22-09-2020

He got really comfy on the curtain rail and slept at sundown.

He was calm and quiet this morning. After awhile though, it was figuring ways to get out, so I let him out in the master bathroom, figuring that if he really wants to leave he’ll eventually find the gap between the slanting glass panels on the small bathroom windows. Left him some new food, water and a birbbath. Not 10 mins later, he DID find the gap and took off!!

Normally, petitions and public support, while encouraging serious discussion and uncovering knowledge on certain issues, still do little concrete change due to the *severe* power imbalance between the public and decision-makers (and their own pursuits too). However, this one, I feel, may just work.

In the latest Master Plan (*and a few Master plans before that tbf*), this entire forest was designated to be a **residential zone**. However, it's still very early in planning stages, with it being ""subject to detailed planning"". The early awareness of this issue could halt any stakeholders from developing what is pristine, *untouched* forest land (okay, slightly touched from old KTM lines, but still). 

The lack of protection it gets from not being declared a Nature Reserve, the potential urbanization from future HDB estates (*which will ALWAYS be extractive of resources, no matter how ""green"" a building is*), and the loss of a natural carbon sink that can mitigate certain pollutants and greenhouse gases, are dangers to this forest.

He also wrote to the SCDF to see if the allegations were true.

> SINGAPORE - Jurong-Clementi Town Council was issued a warning by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) after its officers were unable to use the fire hose reels when a fire broke at a Bukit Batok block last week.

> The fire broke out on Nov 1 at around 4.30am on the 13th floor unit of Block 210A, Bukit Batok Street 21.

> Three people were taken to the Singapore General Hospital for burn injuries and smoke inhalation.

> In a statement issued on Friday (Nov 8), the SCDF said the fire had to be extinguished using water from SCDF's emergency vehicles after its officers found a few hose reel cabinets in the block locked with padlocks.

> After breaking one of the padlocks, there was no water supply for the hose reel inside the cabinet.

> SCDF said that town councils are responsible for the maintenance and proper functioning of their estates' fire safety measures.

> Later on the day of the fire, SCDF inspected the fire hose reels with representatives from the town council, which was then issued with Fire Hazard Abatement Notices (FHAN) under SCDF's framework for dealing with non-compliance with fire safety requirements.

> The notices are warnings issued that require town councils to fix the non-compliance.

> Should the SCDF detect non-compliance issues of the same nature during a re-inspection, the town council would receive a notice of a composition fine of up to $5,000 or even prosecution.

> Related Story SCDF deploys ladder to rescue two men from 13th floor Bukit Batok flat that caught fire

> During various re-inspections of the affected hose reels over the course of the week, SCDF verified that the fire hose reels are accessible and in working order.

> ""SCDF takes a serious view of fire safety and will not hesitate to take action against any non-compliance with fire safety requirements,"" it said.

> The Straits Times has contacted the town council for comment.

> We have all been to our fair share of weddings — but have you ever attended any that left an exceptionally deep imprint on your mind?

> A wedding that Stomper Grace attended on Saturday (Jan 4) was so special and unique that she decided to share her experience with Stomp.

> The joyous occasion was held at Block 306A Clementi Avenue 4 and combined several elements from different cultures.

> Grace said: ""We've all been to weddings in Singapore, but what made the recent one I attended so special is the couple's effortless way of bringing multiculturalism together on their wedding day.

> ""For background, my good friend is a Singaporean Chinese who recently married a Brit who has been living here in Singapore for a number of years now.

> ""With friends and family coming in from all parts of the world, they wanted to show the unique culture of Singapore.""

> According to Grace, the couple chose the void deck of their block in Clementi as their wedding venue ""instead of opting for the usual ballroom"".

> Forget stiff formal gowns and black ties — what made the wedding stand out even more was its 'lepak chic' dress code.

> Grace recounted: ""The food was catered from the couple's favourite restaurant Pariaman, which serves Indonesian cuisine.

> ""There was also a bar that served customised cocktails honouring the couple's respective cultures, as well as a 'potion' inspired by their love for the Dota 2 game.

> ""Guests were entertained with a special lion dance performance and a friendly visit from the ice-cream uncle.""

> Asked if the couple had specifically hired the ice-cream man, Grace explained: ""They reached out to the uncle because he sells ice cream around their block.

> ""They told him, 'Come at this time, we will give you $xxx and you can have some business.'

> ""They weren’t sure if he would turn up because they didn’t officially pre-book him or anything, but he did! So I guess you could say he was hired!

> ""As the groom was Jewish, they also had a chuppah as part of their ceremony decor.""

> (The couple's wedding solemnisation under a chuppah)

> A chuppah is a canopy under which a couple stands during Jewish weddings. It typically consists of a cloth stretched or supported over four poles.

> The Stomper added: ""After the bride was given the ring, the groom broke a glass as everyone shouted, 'Mazel Tov!' (meaning 'congratulations' in Hebrew).

> ""The celebrations continued with a Jewish celebratory dance (known as a Horah), with the bride and groom lifted on chairs while everyone else danced around in circles.""

> (Grace told Stomp that the Horah was her favourite part of the wedding)

> (Ms Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State at the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth and Ministry of Communications and Information, made a surprise appearance at the wedding)

> Grace said: ""What made everything extra special was a surprise visit from the Member of Parliament for Holland-Bukit Timah, Ms Sim Ann, who probably heard about the wedding too!

> ""I can’t think of a better way to witness this beautiful multicultural wedding right here in Singapore.""

> One nature lover in Singapore, Brice Li, who opened the public's eyes to the hidden gem of greenery that is Clementi Forest, has drawn up a new proposal for the forest's conservation.

> 500m boardwalk

> Li first posted dreamy-looking footage of the misty forest at dawn, sparking much online interest at this once-overlooked piece of land.

> The 85-hectare green space is bounded by King Albert Park, Clementi Road, Old Holland-Ulu Pandan Road and the main Rail Corridor, and lies in the heart of Clementi's residential areas.

> On Nov. 28, Li shared to Facebook his idea of conserving the untouched forest.

> He suggested for a 500m elevated boardwalk cum nature trail to be constructed in the forest.

> This boardwalk, he said, would start from Clementi Rd and run towards the Rail Corridor. It would give visitors perfect views of the forest's ""most iconic sites — the dreamy mist-filled area surrounded by dense forestation"".

> The picture-perfect sight, Li said, is a mere 200m away from the main road.

> Another route will then extend for 650m from the boardwalk, and head towards Maju Forest via the Clementi Rail Underpass.

> This route allows visitors to experience travelling through a mature secondary forest and observe the native flora and fauna, as well as enjoy the sight of the historical railway track — which has since been dubbed the ""Lost Railway to Jurong"".

> Speaking to Mothership, Li also said that the proposed route for boardwalk to be built on is also the path that most hikers take when they enter the forest now.

> The path can get really muddy or even flooded with water especially after heavy rain and this is why he proposed to build a boardwalk for more people to enjoy the beauty of the forest comfortably, Li adds.

> No plans for development at the moment: URA

> Li said: ""The rich biodiversity in this unique forest is really worth conserving for future generations.""

> He added that the proposal had been sent to various agencies such as the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), National Parks Board and Minister for National Development, Desmond Lee.

> Previous news of Clementi Forest sparked many calls for its conservation, due to the area being designated for residential development, according to the URA's 2019 Master Plan.

> However, URA has since told Mothership ""there are no immediate plans for residential development at the site"".

> URA added that there is a need to balance both the needs for development and conservation in land-scarce Singapore.

> This includes setting aside land for various housing choices, as well as green spaces.

> ""While there may be some sites which are needed for development, others do not have plans for quite some time to come, and we will ensure they remain green,"" the URA spokesperson said.

> Any development plans for and around Clementi forest will involve necessary studies to take the biodiversity in the area into consideration and to reduce potential impact on the natural environment.

> Totally unrelated but follow and listen to our podcast here

If forests are storage banks of carbon, ideally shouldn’t we be cutting down forests (to make other stuff with this said stored carbon, NOT burn it of course) and replanting trees? Trees eventually die and decompose, which releases CO2. And they can’t really grow a lot bigger when they have reached maturity, which means there’s a limit to how much CO2 they can absorb, to photosynthesise and grow. Won’t planting new trees allow for more potential of absorption of CO2 than relying on existing trees in the long run?",t3_k5ne4i,03-12-2020

Death and decomposition in the forest releases carbon dioxide more slowly, as the wood is broken down over time. And some of the carbon ends up getting buried underground. Clearing forests and processing the timber releases a large proportion of this carbon in a short span of time. Whatever carbon remains in the products made from timber are probably not going to last as long as the trees themselves, so rather than having the carbon locked up in the trees for centuries, it's all going to be released in a matter of years or decades. And when you consider the fact that logging often involves entire stands of trees all being felled at once...

Leaving carbon absorption and sequestration aside, old-growth forests are irreplaceable habitats for many other plant and animal species.

There is a concept to burn trees for heat while utilizing carbon capture technology. As long as trees are replanted it's a long-term net negative co2 effect (provided the production chain does not produce too much co2).

Now imagine if all vehicles on the roads are self driving. There will no longer be a need for traffic lights for vehicles. A central computer will just calculate and control all vehicles. Traffic lights for pedestrians will change from being from timed to push a button. That will remove alot of stopping for buses from traffic lights.

Next, imagine that getting onboard a bus changes from flagging it down to booking it on an app like grab. Not only will you be able to track the bus on the app and know exactly when it will arrive but the central computer can calculate the most efficient path that every bus in Singapore takes depending on the demand at that moment. In a way, buses will act like Grab share. This will reduce so much of the stopping at bus stops. It will also reduce the need to change buses.

Now, with self driving cars, no longer we need huge buses. The reason for huge buses in the first place is because of expensive bus driver. Instead, we can have tiny buses that brings you from one place to another without the need to drop and pick up so many people.

Moreover, if we invest in a double layer or even triple layer of road system, be it underground or overhead, it will significantly increase the number of   
self driving vehicles our roads can handle.

If you take away self ownership of most vehicles and replace them with shared ownership, carparks will become redundant as almost all vehicles will be on the road or in maintenance at all time. That will free up so much land for Singapore.

Not to forget, with the removal of human limitations on roads and all the stopping. Vehicles could travel double, triple or even higher speeds on road.

I'm not sure this is true. We're always going to be constrained by available road space - there's only so many vehicles that can travel along a section of road in a given time at peak hour (because of the physical space taken up by the vehicles + safe following distance), and buses make much better use of that space, achieving much higher throughput (passenger * distance per hour) than smaller cars. Self driving cars might reduce but not eliminate the safe following distance needed.

You talked about adding stacked overhead/underground roads along all the major arterial routes, but that has major downsides: it is going to be super expensive, time-consuming, and also rather ugly; also it's not likely to actually solve the problem, because time and time again adding road capacity in crowded cities like Singapore has been shown to lead to increased road usage due to induced demand, and that increased car usage often swallows up all the added capacity to the point that congestion is just as bad as it was before the new construction.",t3_aajaty,30-12-2018

Think about it, if you do not change the old inefficient bus routes, the new generation of elderly will be stuck with it. That means, our bus routes will become more and more inefficient because the problem with elderly will never go away.

The solution here is to manage the change and decrease the inconvenience to the elderly and not to avoid change altogether. 

A suggestion will be to get the community to help them out. They can work with schools to provide the manpower needed to teach the elderly. Its good community service. I used to be approached by so many elderly asking for directions at public transport. Together we can make bus routes more efficient.

We can also enable automated vehicles at night. Shouldn't make a lot of noise since they won't speed, they won't honk etc. They also will not block people since it is at the dead of night. This will help to improve the image of public automated vehicles in the eyes of civilians.

2. you don't need vehicles to get to those places you like at night
3. cars are expensive af. if you don't use it for the reasons above, still worth it meh?

The third reason will be the most compelling reason. Keep hiking vehicles' costs up while providing automated vehicles. This is probably not ethical on some level but I think it will be the most effective.",t3_aajaty,30-12-2018

> On Nov. 22, Lianhe Wanbao reported that the hose reel cabinets in three Housing Board blocks were used by residents to store various items.

> Advertisement

> These included mattresses, full-length mirrors, ladders, and suitcases.

> Now according to The Straits Times, the Jurong-Clementi Town Council (JCTC) has removed all the items in the cabinets and told residents not to use the spaces for storage.

> This is because of the danger it poses to Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) crews in the event of an emergency.

> The SCDF had said that it would look into the matter and follow up with the town council.

> Advertisement

> They inspected the blocks on Saturday, according to The Straits Times.

> According to Wanbao, the items were found in hose reels cabinets on ten storeys in Blocks 422 and 423 and the carpark of Black 419 in Clementi Avenue 1.

> The residents were reported to have placed household items in the cabinets because they did not have enough space in their houses.

> A town council spokesman was quoted by The Straits Times as saying that investigations would continue, and be expanded to other blocks.

> They also indicated that residents would be reminded that “storing items in fire hose compartments is not advisable”.

> Previous hose reels cabinet case in Jurong-Clementi Town Council

> Recently, SCDF issued a warning to JCTC, after firefighters faced difficulties in using on-site fire hose reels to battle a blaze at a HDB flat in Bukit Batok.

> On Nov. 1, a fire broke out at Blk 210A, Bukit Batok St. 21 at around 4:30 am.

> However, SCDF had to break one of the padlocked cabinets to access the hose reel.

> They were then unable to use it as there was no water supply.

> SCDF personnel subsequently had to extinguish the fire using water from the SCDF’s emergency vehicles.

> On Nov. 15, Bukit Batok SMC Member of Parliament Murali Pillai apologised to the residents for the unfortunate incident.

> He also said that the town council has identified two officers who were responsible for padlocking the fire hose compartments to prevent misused.

> They have admitted to their mistakes and the Town Council management will pursue disciplinary action against them.

> SINGAPORE — A taxi driver on Wednesday (17 July) admitted to causing the death of a 19-year-old National University of Singapore female undergraduate whom he was ferrying following an accident in Clementi Road.

> Yap Kok Hua, 55, pleaded guilty to one count each of negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide and a negligent act causing grievous injury for the accident on 19 April last year. One count of causing injury through a negligent act and one of failing to ensure his passengers wore seatbelts were taken into consideration for his sentencing.

> Just prior to the accident, Yap was about to turn at a junction at Commonwealth Avenue West and Clementi Road. He had attempted to make a right turn into Clementi Road despite seeing a car coming at a high speed towards him in the opposite direction.

> NUS undergraduate Kathy Ong Kai Ting was seated at the rear left of Yap's taxi along with two other men, Ting Jun Heng, who was beside her, and Lim Jin Jie, who was at the rear right of the taxi.

> Another man, Zon Lim Thou Jung, was seated at the front passenger seat of the taxi. The three men were 22 years old.

> The group was heading back to a NUS residential college, Tembusu College, when they were involved in the accident.

> Video footage of the accident last year made its rounds online.

> The court heard that on the night of 19 April last year, Yap picked up the four passengers from Clementi Mall. Yap did not ensure that his rear passengers were wearing their seat-belts before moving off.

> Yap then drove along Commonwealth Avenue West towards Commonwealth Avenue on the rightmost lane. Upon reaching the signalised cross junction of Commonwealth Avenue West by Clementi Road, Yap stopped at the red traffic light. When the traffic light signal turned green, but before the green right turn arrow lit up, Yap drove into the right turn pocket.

> He stopped and checked for vehicles coming from the opposite direction. Even though he saw a car coming towards him from the opposite direction at a high speed, he decided to do a right turn.

> The 21-year-old car driver, Ng Li Ning, who had the right of way, was unable to avoid the taxi and the two vehicles collided. A Health Sciences Authority report later found that Ng was travelling at a speed of 92 kmh to 97 kmh on a road with a speed limit of 70kmh. The same report also found that had Ng's car been travelling within the speed limit, a collision would likely have been avoidable.

> Both cars spun and were severely damaged, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh. The taxi also hit another car which was stationary at the signalised junction.

> All the passengers were conveyed to National University Hospital where Ong was pronounced dead at 10.25pm.

> Zon Lim suffered from multiple facial lacerations, bruises and glass in his wounds.

> Lim Jin Jie received bruises and a fracture to his spine.

> Ting had a traumatic brain injury, and became vegetative initially but his condition has since improved. He suffered multiple injuries to his ribs, lung, left kidney and pelvic bone, and was dependent on a ventilator. He is still undergoing rehabilitation.

> DPP Koh sought eight weeks' jail for Yap and a disqualification from driving for five years.

> The accident claimed Ong’s life and inflicted serious lasting injuries to three others, said the prosecutor. The accused was “aware of the danger approaching but decided to run the risk anyway”, he added.

> Yap was fined for several traffic offences up to 2016, including failing to conform to red light signal on three occasions, careless driving and speeding, according to the prosecutor.

> Josephus Tan, Yap’s lawyer, asked for six weeks' jail but agreed with the prosecution on the disqualification period.

> The lawyer from Invictus Law pointed out that Tan had first checked for oncoming traffic.

> ""This is in stark contrast to the typical dangerous driving or even careless driving cases whereby the offender simply proceeds to drive through the junction without a single stop whatsoever,"" said Tan.

> Referring to the HSA report, Tan pointed out that the accident might have been avoidable if Ng had been travelling within the speed limit.

> Yahoo News Singapore understands that action will be taken against Ng.

> For a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, Yap could be jailed up to two years, fined or both. For causing grievous hurt through a negligent act he faces jail of up to two years, or a maximum $5,000 fine, or both.

They later added more lines in the north that absorbed branch line into a continuous NS line. This means that those heading towards jurong east now had an additional route, via woodlands, hence the small print ""via woodlands""

>The MRT has since been expanded. The first expansion was in 1996. This was a S$1.2 billion expansion of the North South Line into Woodlands, merging the Branch Line into the North South Line and joining Yishun and Choa Chu Kang Stations.

1306,4,du6dup2,t3_7x8lts,"Would say that it's more to let commuters know that the direct route may not necessarily mean the shortest route.

e.g. From Bukit Batok to City Hall – one *can* take the Red line all the way, but it's much faster to transfer at JE and take the Green line instead. Those who are not so familiar with travel times may end up thinking that a direct route=a faster route; this is especially the case with tourists.

But you see the signage and it says ""to Jurong East via Woodlands"" and you'll be like ""wtf I need go all the way to woodlands(north) then go JE(west)??""

It's basically to tell commuters that it will pass through Woodlands which is popularly very north and far away from the rest of SG. The North South Line is a mess in which the northbound train is towards MSP and the south bound train can go towards the north due to the urban geography of the planned towns in Singapore (surrounding the central catchment area). This is just a way for SMRT to guide commuters to take a more ideal route and to let them know that they will go around via woodlands rather than thru straight to JE.",t3_7x8lts,13-02-2018
1309,4,du6bldu,t3_7x8lts,"Here is my theory. (Not very confident in my answer)

1. It is for easier commuting to the neighbouring Malaysia via Woodlands.
2. Back then when the North-South Line was first constructed, it was from only Yio Chu Lang to Toa Payoh in 1987. Then, there was the sight extension towards Yishun and Marina Bay. The first official extension of the North South Line is to close up the gap from Choa Chu Kang (The northern end of the former Branch Line) to Yishun.

To go from Orchard to CCK, you'd probably take the EW line. Woodlands is about as far as you'd want to go in many cases.

1314,4,du6gcb6,t1_du6dtf2,"For those of us old enough to remember when there was only the North, South, East and Marina lines, with 2 central interchange stations, this is the right answer.

When they added the Woodlands line, it was somewhat equal in timing to travel from Bishan to Jurong East via Woodlands or the old route of going via City Hall then west to Jurong East. Thus, any trips from Braddell onwards would actually be faster if you didn't take the direct route.

> SINGAPORE - A personal mobility device (PMD) that was being charged in a Housing Board common corridor on Thursday (Dec 5) caused a fire that led to three residents being evacuated, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said.

> There were no reported injuries, SCDF added in a Facebook post on Thursday.

> The fire happened at Block 715 Clementi West Street 2 at 12.45pm, and was put out by SCDF officers with a water jet.

> In the first half of this year, 49 fires related to PMDs were reported - an average of about two a week.

> In the worst of these, a 40-year-old man died in hospital in July after he was rescued from his burning Bukit Batok flat, with the blaze linked to three e-scooters later found burnt in the unit.

> SCDF also reminded PMD owners to ensure their devices adhere to UL2272 safety standards, which is a set of safety requirements covering the electrical drive train system of PMDs, including the battery system.

> The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has previously said that the estimated 80,000 PMD users here must make sure their devices comply with the UL2272 standard by July 1 next year.

> The LTA is facilitating the free disposal of non-UL2272-certified PMDs at 181 spots across the island, in a scheme that will last six months from Sept 23 this year to March 31 next year. Those who do so before Dec 31 are eligible for a $100 incentive.

> More information on the disposal scheme can be found on LTA's website.

> Chua surmised that these people were borrowing money due to the economic impact of Covid-19.

> He also questioned why the shop was still operating by its back door, even though its front was closed like all the other shops.

> Are moneylenders considered an essential service?

> According to GoBusiness, services ""relating to maintenance of monetary and financial stability"" are considered essential services.

> In response to queries by Mothership, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and Ministry of Law (MinLaw) have confirmed that ""licensed moneylenders who have obtained general exemption are allowed to continue with limited operations during the circuit breaker period.""

> However, they have to ""adhere to strict safe distancing measures"" and are ""subject to limited operating days and hours"".

> Here is their statement in full:

> ""Licensed moneylenders provide access to credit to persons who may otherwise turn to unlicensed moneylenders. Licensed moneylenders who have obtained general exemption are allowed to continue with limited operations during the circuit breaker period. As with other businesses which are permitted to operate, licensed moneylenders are to adhere to strict safe distancing measures. In addition, licensed moneylenders are subject to limited operating days and hours, to further minimise the risks of transmission.""
