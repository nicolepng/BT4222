49,26,dxtg1b7,t3_8e8ing,"I just drove past the junction about 2 hours ago. It's a T-junction for vehicles and buses to exit Yio Chu Kang MRT. So unless you are exiting from the station, you are simply driving on a straight road. Yes, it is a very busy pedestrian crossing because all the HDB flats and schools are across the road. Still, I don't understand how the lorry could have swerved into pedestrians by driving straight. The only possibility I can think of is if the driver thought the junction was an entrance to the station, saw a bus exiting and swerved to avoid the bus. ",t3_8e8ing,23-04-2018

TL;DR, say on average you have 12 fatal accidents a year.  They are unlikely to happen once a month on the same day, so that would mean there is a high probability that there will be large gaps followed by two events being closer together.

Imo the first area to look into is the driving test. Driving tests only measure ones' ability to handle a vehicle in that given time in his/her's most focused state of mind. Not ones' situation control and spatial awareness over an extended period of time,driving duration and experience. It definitely needs an overhaul. And if someones' aptitude is determined to be lacking, the person should be disallowed from driving for life. Not everyone is born with good situational handling and spatial awareness.

I’ve done professional lab analysis of the presence of ammonia in wastewater, using APHA4500 (standards for the examination of water and wastewater). 

May I have how you did the test yourself? Also, some more info about what reagent/indicator you are using would be great :)


Also, even though the vial is not accurate enough, you’ll need to fill the water up til the calibration mark, what this means is to have the meniscus of the water level alongside the calibration mark. Even though this only contributes to negative error, I suspect that this would be a sign of various other analyst errors.

Besides, what did you rinse your equipment and apparatus with? The concentration level of ammonia is quite low (0.5ppm, approx 5mg/L). As normal tap water is not pure enough, preferably de-ionized water should be used (if you have it) or store-brought distilled water could be used.

Of course, boiled water works too, as it “boils” the ammonia/ammonium off. However, this introduces various other errors which may affect the delicate accuracy and precision of the final reading.

204,26,g4yj6ti,t1_g4xpxeo,"Hi, thanks for reaching out man.

Currently, I'm using a basic test kit for aquariums, API NH3/NH4 test kit with 3 different test tubes and 3 different pipettes.

Regarding water levels, its seen from a different angle but I've filled it well up to meniscus and gotten rid of parallax error.

Unfortunately, I used tap water to rinse as I'm not actually conducting water tests for accuracy and research but rather mainly because I'm moving homes and trying to see if the water running in my new home is stable and safe for aquamarine life. 

However, i do agree there are a lot of errors because previously, i has a result of 2.0ppm ammonia from contamination and many other errors. But thanks to other replies from people, I found out that the standard of drinking water is usually at a 0.5ppm, which is a relief.

Again, not trying to shit on anyone or promote anything, but thanks for reaching out to me and helping out, really appreciate it!

A filter would definitely fix it, which is why my new house has one but not technically for drinking purposes (as it reuses rainwater).",t3_ircnx1,12-09-2020

Tap water definitely has chlorine. The garage filtered water doesn't have any traces of chlorine. Usually chloramine is in the water and take a day or so to evaporate.",t3_ircnx1,14-09-2020
209,26,g577vxj,t1_g56h7s7,"okay just take it as some rainwater and filter tt type of thing. But it says ""not for drinking"".

Then i compared that water and our tap water and it's safer to drink than tap water.",t3_ircnx1,14-09-2020

211,26,g5160xa,t1_g50yc2j,"Because using fish biology to make a conclusion about human biological needs is extremely misleading at best. Different animals require different living conditions. 

It would be like someone asking if 400psi air pollution is bad for humans, only for the response to be that fish can still survive when the air is 400psi. Of course fish are unaffected by air pollution since they're underwater -- and we shouldn't draw a conclusion that humans are also likewise unaffected by air pollution. 

Similarly, the presence of small amounts of ammonia in our water supply affects fishes more significantly because they live in the water permanently, while we only drink it perhaps once every hour.",t3_ircnx1,13-09-2020

214,26,g57j60b,t1_g57j3h4,Yeah Ik it has but there was some rumours about needing more anti chlorine for water changes for fishes cause of a supposed increase in chlorine levels,t3_ircnx1,14-09-2020
215,26,g51qmah,t1_g5160xa,yeah and tolerance level for ammonia content for fishes and humans are surely different as well,t3_ircnx1,13-09-2020

217,26,g57k6qc,t1_g57j60b,"Well so far i tested my aged water (ordinary bucket/pail of around 7gallons), not any traces of chlorine.

If needed, I suggest ageing the water. It's healthier for fishes thanks to the water being more oxygenated. Chlorine evaporates within 24hrs as well.",t3_ircnx1,14-09-2020
