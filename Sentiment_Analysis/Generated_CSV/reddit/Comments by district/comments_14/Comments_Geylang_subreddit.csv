This has to be the most implicit Malay song about Geylang ....


Especially the last sentence, ""pulang mari lah pulang bersama sama"" = let us go home together.

Paku = Nail. You know lah ....

Rama Rama = butterfly


Original lyrics:


Geylang si paku geylang 

Geylang si rama rama

Pulang marilah pulang

Marilah pulang bersama sama

But you have to understand that their primary purpose isn't quite the same as whatever I'm doing here. Their focus is more of ""where to find food"" with the occasional tidbit of information. 

&#x200B;

And... the sad thing is there isn't really much other food blogs in Singapore that don't focus on where to find food. SethLui videos are actually branching out a little away from purely food reviews, and they recently accepted my contribution talking about Fish Soup history. [tuck-shop.co](https://tuck-shop.co) is an investigation journal that is pretty interesting, but considering the authors are in the US it's not actually a Singapore blog now, kinda. 

&#x200B;

There's a very simple reason why this is. If you put out an article ""good stuff in Sengkang"", people will seek out that article and share it with their friends. It doesn't even matter if the words don't say anything. You just need to have filler sometimes. Because people don't read. It's why Instagram marketing works. Once you trained the photography skills, writing speed, etc, it's pretty quick to pump out articles like this. As long as Sengkang or any place exist and people feel the want to eat something different, they will look for your article. And because people seek your articles, you don't have to actively appeal to them. 

&#x200B;

On the flip side, because it is theoretically quick to execute and relatively fast to train, there's A LOT of content like this. But once you build authority (like the major food blogs here) people will seek you out. 

&#x200B;

Then on the other hand, nobody really cares about ""history of XX food"" or ""why pasar malam hipster"" enough to search about it. It's not something people think about, so they don't look for it. So conversely we have to look for people who might be interested in the topic, show it to them and hope it catches their attention. Every read is something actively fought for. 

And the nature of the topic requires a lot of research and time just to write a few words. It also happens that a lot of people blog as a side while full timing, so almost nobody can or are willing to do research.",t3_bpcwga,17-05-2019

The question is how long does it take for change to happen. Now people's opinions gets voiced out pretty fast, so I would expect Pasar Malam to become closer and closer to what people want. 

If over time people decide that traditional things have no place anymore then Pasar malam would only have hipster things. As far as I can tell, people value tradition, though they won't necessarily put active effort to prevent it from phasing out, save for a minority. 

Worse case scenario we are just left with records. But then maybe 50 years after that some other people can use that to revive the tradition. 

The gahmen is unsurprisingly powerful since, when you look at the history, they were basically the ones who controlled how the pasar malam turns out indirectly. But they're made up of people too so hopefully the gahmen and people value the same thing.",t3_bpcwga,16-05-2019

he said he used to sell shoes/slippers/sandals at pasar malam every night, earning bit by bit and I just have the mental image of him carrying a rucksack of shoes and just laying his wares at our modern day kind of pasar malams. he's also the only person with some understanding of malay in our family because he had to speak it there. 

eventually he made enough to get/rent a shophouse by the 1970s because my dad earliest memories of his childhood were around the shophouse areas in jalan besar.

I guess you could consider yourself really successful if you owned a shophouse at 1970s because by the time I was born my grandpa had already owned a warehouse distributing shoes to other shophouses.",t3_bpcwga,17-05-2019

Like you said, the Instagram marketing spiel is fairly cookie cutter - it's basically at least one young and fairly pretty girl who will prance into the location and then pose with one or two bites with stock music playing and food prices displayed onscreen. Ratings are incredibly inconsistent and arbitrary with no real indicator of quality.

Being able to take a holistic look at the sociohistoric context underlying the food is something I never expected and very much appreciate - it makes you a more informed consumer, not just in the sense of consuming food but as a consumer in the greater sense of the word. I personally think it makes the food taste that much better knowing what goes into it, not just literally but culturally as well. Cheers!",t3_bpcwga,17-05-2019

I was on a jog late at night and I went to rest under a HDB block. Then I saw this father holding his daughter by the hand and the kid was screaming bloody murder and crying. The kid broke free and ran away but the father chased and caught up. 

I took notice because it didn't sound anything like regular children's crying and I was trying to figure out how to help but before I could, the father pulled the girl into the lift. Unfortunately I was sitting too far from the lift to see the floor display. 

I hung around for another half an hour trying to see if the screams would come again so I could pinpoint the location, even took a lift upstairs and walked a few corridors hoping I could hear something from inside a house, but it was just pindrop silence. 

Eventually I came across this couple in the void deck and I asked them if they had heard the screaming, they said yeah they did and it was pretty bad but they couldn't figure out where it was from either.

To this day, I don't know what happened to the girl.",t3_j5xy6r,07-10-2020
412,14,g7wh80z,t3_j5xy6r,"It's true that what he did was wrong and deserved punishment. Anyone with eyes can know that.

However, as his actions clearly show the lack of maturity, the action of uploading the video and the virality of it may not be the best choice.

There are many reasons why identity of minors are almost always kept secret in cases. This should be no different. 

Imagine someone immature enough to do this action, now thinks the whole world is against him or wants him dead. Two things are possible:

1) He learns from this episode and really change his ways.

2) He thinks the world already doesn't care about him or even bothers to give him a chance. Why should he care about anything or anyone's opinions anymore? Continue down worse paths or ends everything.

What is the probability of scenario 1 happening? As bad as those actions were, do we really want to see a 16 year old go down path 2?

Before yall downvote me for ""symphatising"" him, hear me out. Unless you grow up in a toxic n abusive family you wont know the frustration of it. I remember as a pri sch kid once i spent more ($4) than i should during recess (i was given $1.50 everyday to cover recess n lunch, which was hardly enough) and my mom chased after me with a fcuking chopper when she learnt about it. 

When i became a little older it didnt get better, i was kicked and beaten black n blue by my drunkard dad, my school teachers knew but nobody said anything. I have my stuff taken away, things like important documents, contracts, receipts (for claims etc) and valuables getting ransacked. Nmom wanted to take my laptop i use as a spare to give it away to my maternal cousin (her nephew) Idk why dafuq my mom did that, and i confronted her nicely she just went into this crazy tantrum and started slapping me for idk what. Then i restrained her to defend myself (i learned martial art in poly), and she started going to all my neighbours and relatives saying i beat her up. LOL unfortunately most of my relatives bashed me for being unfilial, only a handful believed in me which i am grateful for until today.

Tbh idk what ppl are expecting from me. Am i supposed to stand there and get beaten up? Lmfao

Instead of bashing the kid and asking him to kill himself, honestly, trying to help this dysfunctional family improve would be a way better solution.

> Stomp understands former businessman Zeng Guoyuan, who is better known as 'Parrot Man', was found dead at the foot of Block 68 Geylang Bahru on Saturday night (Nov 16).

> Stompers Fitzy and Sri alerted Stomp to the incident.

> Sri said she saw a police death tent set up at the foot of the block at about 11pm.

> Fitzy, who was neighbours with Zeng and often saw him in the neighbourhood, said that she saw a stain on the ground near the block.

> In response to a Stomp query the police said they were alerted to a case of unnatural death at about. 9.54pm.

> ""A 66-year-old man was found lying motionless at the foot of the said block and was pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic,"" a police spokesman said.

> Police investigations are ongoing.

> ""I hope that our fellow Singaporeans will pray he rests in peace instead of making him a laughing stock,"" Fitzy said.

> Zeng made headlines over the years for his several run-ins with the law.

> He earned his nickname 'Parrot Man' in 2008 after blaming his pet parrot for getting him arrested and charged with abusive language on two police officers. He was fined $2,500.

> In 2011, he gained attention for his unsuccessful attempts at contesting the 2011 general election and presidential election.

> In 2014, he was diagnosed with nose cancer. Following surgery, he was left with a gaping hole in his face where his nose used to be.

> The next year, he told The New Paper that he was selling tissue paper for a living and could no longer look after his beloved parrots.

> In 2017, the management of Ngee Ann City shopping mall had to put up a notice at its premises warning the public not to donate any money to Zeng.

> The management had called the police over 30 times that year to report that Zeng had been pretending to be crippled while selling tissue packets along the underground pedestrian walkway linking Ngee Ann City and Wisma Atria.

> In September that year, a fire broke out at a Geylang Bahru flat that reportedly belonged to him despite his previous claims to be homeless.

> Last August, he was arrested along Orchard Road for persisting in disorderly behaviour despite repeated warnings from police.

> He was arrested again in October after turning violent and hurting two police officers at Geylang Serai.

It's easy to tell them to stay in a hotel, but a hotel room typically does not have a kitchen. For this and other reasons, you can't usually have a normal life in a hotel room. If you can it's usually in a suite that costs an arm and a leg, at least 5x more than a regular rental.

If you want luxury for a short term, like the other person said, service apartments are the way to go. Yes you pay for the luxury, but it works and you don't cause headaches/spoil the residential character of neighbourhoods. Even normal/non-corporate landlords will expect more rent for a short-term stay because of the hassle that isn't amortized.

AirBnB in HDB/condos are just asking for trouble.

I don't think so. It's the same why you can get chicken rice at the hawker centre for $4 or go to Mandarin Hotel for their famed chatterbox chicken rice for ~$25. You don't get 6x the serve at Mandarin Hotel, but instead you pay for the atmosphere. You may say Mandarin Hotel is high end, branded, etc, but I think it is essentially the same.

Wrong. It caters to the instagram crowd now, most of the stalls aren't even selling traditional pasar malam foods anymore. It's all food stuff that people want to take pictures with or other novelty products.

Which is why I called it another artbox.

>The fact that you keep blaming high rentals as the sole reason of high food price

I'm not blaming anything. That's literally the reason given by stall renters.

> ignoring that the high rental is byproduct of it's own success.

What am I ignoring? We were talking about the lack of an authentic pasar malam atmosphere.

Actually, yeah. Because teenagers will blindly follow influencers who are paid to do promo pieces. And people will show up out of nostalgia and leave disappointed.

If you've actually been there, you'd know for yourself. But you haven't and are just talking out of your ass because like I said, and you've continuously shown by your comments, you are arguing for the sake of arguing.

> SINGAPORE: A Bangladeshi worker was sentenced to death on Monday (Dec 14) for murdering his domestic helper girlfriend in a Geylang hotel two years ago.

> Ahmed Salim, 31, was convicted of killing his girlfriend of six years after a tryst in the Golden Dragon Hotel on Dec 30, 2018, when she refused to leave another man for him.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Ahmed, who was betrothed to another woman at the time, first strangled 34-year-old Indonesian national Nurhidayati Wartono Surata with a towel. He then tied a rope around her neck in several knots and twisted her head forcefully.

> He stole her valuables and left her body to be found by a receptionist later that night. An autopsy found the cause of death to be strangulation and a cervical spine injury.

> Judicial Commissioner Mavis Chionh found that his actions before, during and after the killing ""demonstrated premeditation, cogent planning and methodical execution"".

> She rejected Ahmed's partial defence of grave and sudden provocation – that the victim had humiliated him by saying: ""He is better than you, he is better than you in the hotel, he is better in bed, he is better financially. If you don't believe, next week I will go with him, we’ll make a video and show you.""

> The judge found that the victim had said no such humiliating words. Ahmed had not mentioned these words in his multiple police statements and in his interviews with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) psychiatrist.

> The allegations surfaced only one-and-a-half years after the incident, when Ahmed was providing his account of events to the defence psychiatrist.

> ""I find his explanations for his failure to mention the humiliating words in the police statements and to (the IMH psychiatrist) to be far-fetched,"" said the judge. ""I agree with the prosecution that the accused's story of the humiliating words was precisely that – a story.""

> Advertisement

> Even if the victim had said such words, the judge said that this was a premeditated killing, with Ahmed keeping a rope in his pants and taking it with him to the hotel and clearing his bank account beforehand.

> ""On the totality of the evidence ... I find that the accused had decided even before Dec 30, 2018, that he would kill the deceased so long as she refused to leave her new boyfriend and to get back together with him,"" said Judicial Commissioner Chionh.

> Ahmed had also made several admissions in his police statements that showed his premeditated plan to kill the victim.

> In his testimony at trial, led by defence lawyers Eugene Thuraisingam, Chooi Jing Yen and Hamzah Malik, Ahmed said he considered the victim to be his wife, even though they were not married.

> He was diagnosed with adjustment disorder at the time of the offence, but no contributory link was found between this disorder and the crime.

Consumers lose coz they have to pay high prices, vendors lose as rental goes up and their margins get cut, pasar malam organizers lose as they put up higher bids each year (do they collect full rental prior to the bazaar?

A makeshift cough syrup dispensary operating behind a coffee shop in Geylang Lorong 7 sees brisk business every night. No consultation is needed, and the plastic bottles do not come with labels.

And the ""doctors""? Middle-aged men who you can be certain have no medical training, yet are more than ready to sell bottles of cough syrup to anyone willing to pay.

The bottles are hidden inside mailboxes and motorcycle top cases just a few metres away, and are retrieved once a sale is made.

The cough mixture is believed to contain codeine, an opiate abused by addicts for a high.

This black market, which extends also to Lorongs 9 and 11, has persisted despite raids by the authorities over the years.

Demand drives the supply of codeine cough preparations, according to the Health Sciences Authority, which works with various other agencies to monitor and carry out enforcement operations.

More than 460 litres of codeine cough mixtures with an estimated street value of $130,000 were seized from 2016 to last year, with 17 people prosecuted for illegal selling.

When The Sunday Times visited one of the illegal dispensaries last Wednesday night, some customers - mostly men in their 20s to 40s - were seen approaching a man sitting at the coffee shop.

The man, who looked to be in his 40s, would glance around warily, walk to the back, grab a few bottles of the brown liquid and exchange them for cash.

There were at least 10 buyers over the course of an hour or so, with several people purchasing a few bottles at one go. Some later gulped down the contents in quick succession in back alleys before tossing the used containers into drains.

The transactions - lasting no more than 30 seconds each - usually took place with at least two other people acting as lookouts, strategically positioned inside the coffee shop and along the road.

The men, dressed casually in T-shirts and bermudas, alert the sellers if there is a whiff of law enforcement in the vicinity.

One peddler claims his cough mixture is ""homemade"".

""This is good. We also take it,"" he adds, while counting a wad of $10 notes before putting them in his shorts pocket.

Despite their discreet operations, it is easy to find the peddlers - just follow the trail of used bottles. The Sunday Times has seen about 30 empty ones scattered along pavements and drains in the area.

Abusers buy the mixture from the black market when they are not able to get enough from doctors, who cannot prescribe more than 240ml of cough mixture containing codeine to a patient at any one time.

But these illegal fixes do not come cheap.

Each 90ml bottle costs between $20 and $30 on the black market. A similar bottle at a clinic would cost between $7 and $13.

Abusers have no choice but to turn elsewhere, given the strict laws on clinics dispensing codeine cough mixtures, said one user.

The bespectacled middle-aged man, who takes three bottles - or about 270ml - of cough syrup every other day, said in Mandarin: ""Most doctors give only one or two bottles, so I have to hop from one clinic to another to get more. There's also the long waiting time.

""Here, it is much easier to get a few bottles at one go.""

He said he would ""feel sick"" if he did not get his fix. The ""high"", he said, lasts for about three hours.

But addicts buy at their own peril, as black-market cough mixtures are produced with little or no quality control.

Anyone caught illegally importing or selling cough preparations containing codeine can be fined up to $50,000, or jailed for up to two years, or both.",t3_bacoge,07-04-2019

> Suppers are usually a quick and chill affair since they do happen in the middle of the night.

> But some people in Geylang might well have experienced the most chaotic meal they might ever have had.

> So you may or may not have heard, but a fight took place outside an alleyway eatery along Geylang Lorong 19 at around 3am on Thursday, Mar. 15.

> A smartphone [link is removed], alongside three other clips from a dashboard camera in a parked car nearby, was uploaded to Facebook on Friday, March 16.

> From what we gather, there are three main players in this episode:

> In the first clip with the clearest audio, which starts sometime after the first dashcam clip, Ah Beng in Black, accompanied by two other men, including Singlet Buibui, was seen hurling vulgarities as he exited an eatery and approached White-Shirted Dude, who was by this point standing outside.

> 
[https://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29127703_2019596268293125_2306411658588717056_n.mp4](https://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29127703_2019596268293125_2306411658588717056_n.mp4)

> The [link is removed] shows groups of patrons standing up from their seats and moving away from the eatery in view of the conflict that likely began inside. White-Shirted Dude is seen gesticulating to three others he stumbled out of the eatery and seating area with, and yelling at another group of people inside and off-screen.

> The fight got physical when White-Shirted Dude aimed a kick at Ah Beng in Black who was swearing at him, after Ah Beng had knocked down a red stool nearby, with another man and Singlet Buibui backing him up.

> It was White-Shirted Dude who would not prevail, however, ending up getting hit, kicked and stepped on by Ah Beng in Black, Singlet Buibui and another fellow, with Singlet Buibui giving his head a good hard kick, even as he lay flat on the ground.

> In the midst of the attack, a few women tried to stop Ah Beng in Black, Singlet Buibui and their friend from continuing their attack, but one of them (seen here in a white top) was hit back at quite hard by Singlet Buibui.

> Now, normally violence on one woman should suffice to scare the rest off right away, right? Not to Singlet Buibui, though, clearly, because he turned around and followed another woman who was retreating, and decided he had to knock her (on the head, we should add) squarely to the ground too:

> 

> In case you’re wondering where the police was in all this, they were alerted to the incident at 3:19am and have arrested one man (we’re not sure if he happens to be one of the three main players in this scuffle, though).

> Here’s the statement they shared with us:

> “On 15 march at 3.19am, Police were alerted to a case of public nuisance at the vicinity of Lorong 19 Geylang.

> A 22-year-old man was arrested for uttering threatening words and the use of criminal force against public servants.

> This investigation is ongoing.”

My Malaysian friends lamented that their neighbourhood WhatsApp group featured suggestions on beating the police roadblock (their MCO is more restrictive than ours) & reach their *kampung* places in time for Raya & I felt that such behaviours betrays the spirit of the MCO. The movement control order was meant to protect the people from cross-state infections, and rural areas don't generally have easy access to healthcare. I'm stumped to know of people that want to break the law just because they can never shake off their habit (or tradition if you ask a heartland Malay).

For good reasons the enforcement in Singapore is strong, and I have no doubt that the Malays here don't think, generally, like their Malaysian counterparts like what I mentioned above. But as a general feeling, the desire to make Aidilfitri all about socializing is too strong to shake off, and given this is the first year of the pandemic, it is painful to see people wouldn't have the foresight to let go of some traditions in lieu of prevailing global needs.

I advise for patience: for in our anger against them, we forget that we, too, will become them in the future; we best do not respond with anger but with indifference, for we remember that their follies now serve as a reminder to us not to become like them when we become old ourselves.

Drug peddlers even fucking operate outside the Geylang UOB branch. This has been ongoing for many many many years now and even with the new Geylang Police Headquarters built nearby, still persists. 

At this point, I dont think the ""oh they are just bidding their time to catch the real masterminds"" hold water. SPF needs to fucking clean this shit up. Its been fucking years and I'm also sick of it.

Sure its not heroin, but these are nevertheless illegal drugs that people can well overdose on, harming themselves and even die. These are not prescribed and contain illicit substances that are not allowed by HSA for good reason, they are selling knock off pills.

The phrase is also used in some popular media, in particular, the *Command and Conquer: Generals* video game, in which a Chinese faction player can *research* a tech aptly called ""[subliminal messaging][2]"" to improve the effectiveness of their propaganda towers.

In defence of the accepted meaning via the dictionary, the word *subliminal* requires the speaker to contextualise a situation that is unknown or unseen to the listener, failure of which the meaning is lost to general audiences. In this context, on first view, the message in the picture is an overt message to passers-by and is clearly visible to people without needing to hide itself among its surroundings. It is not ""subliminal"", that is: it asks of its readers to act contrarian to prevailing thoughts that has become the hallmark of the general public's political participation in Singapore over the last few decades.

For this writer, however, there is also a hidden meaning to the message, instead. As this writer have waived off his capability to vote (owing to personal circumstances) the message is clear: after seeing how the Malaysian public behaved in their last election, it is refreshing that there exist pockets of Singaporeans who understood the meaning of the power of the ballot vote. Uplifting? Maybe. We shall see soon.

> SINGAPORE - There were 75 new cases of Covid-19 infections in Singapore as of noon on Saturday (April 4), with 69 of them being local cases with no recent travel history abroad, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said.

> Four new coronavirus clusters have also been identified. Three of them are workers' dormitories - Sungei Tengah Lodge, Toh Guan Dormitory and Cochrane Lodge II. The other cluster is located at The Orange Ballroom, a wedding venue at Geylang Road.

> Of the new cases, only six were imported cases with a recent travel history to Europe, North and South America and Asean.

> Forty of the 69 new local cases are linked to previous cases or clusters, while 29 cases are unlinked, and contact tracing efforts are ongoing, said MOH.

> The number of new imported cases has continued to be lower than locally transmitted ones prompting new elevated measures.

> In a wave of new sweeping measures, the Government implemented a ""circuit breaker"" to pre-empt escalating coronavirus infections with most workplaces closed from Tuesday and all schools moving to full home-based learning on Wednesday, among other restrictions.

> Earlier on Saturday, MOH announced Singapore's sixth death from the virus. The patient, an 88-year-old male Singapore permanent resident, had no recent travel history to affected countries and regions.

> He was confirmed to have Covid-19 infection on March 29 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) a day later. The man was cared for in the intensive care unit since March 30. He developed serious complications and eventually died. He had a history of heart and kidney disease, cancer and diabetes.

> He is a locally transmitted case.

> SINGAPORE: A man who scrawled graffiti, including racist messages, on walls and pillars in the Geylang area was sentenced to 13 months' jail and nine strokes of the cane on Monday (Jun 17).

> Chen Jianbang, 31, was also sentenced to an additional 60 days' jail for breaching a remission order. He had been in remission from a 21-month jail term meted out in 2017 for housebreaking.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Across the span of one week in January this year, Chen scrawled more than 10 messages in permanent marker in public places such as void deck walls and sheltered walkways in Geylang and Aljunied, court documents said.

> These acts of ""racially motivated vandalism"" included messages such as ""MALAY MATI"" meaning ""Malay die"", according to the documents.

> The messages were written ""with the deliberate intention of wounding the racial feelings of the Malay population"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Shen Wanqin.

> Aside from the racist graffiti, which formed the bulk of the charges, Chen also wrote lines such as ""DAVE IS SICK"" on a wall at Lai Ming Hotel and ""GARY IS A B****"" on a traffic light control box in Geylang.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Chen pleaded guilty to five charges of vandalism and wounding racial feelings, with another 12 charges taken into consideration for sentencing.

> ACTS NOTICED BY PUBLIC, AUTHORITIES

> His vandalism acts were noticed by several people, including the station master of Aljunied MRT station, a police officer on patrol and a passer-by, all three of whom called the police.

> The graffiti had to be removed with thinner or painted over by hotel employees, town council employees and SMRT employees, depending on where the vandalism occurred.

> In one instance on Jan 7 this year, an MRT passenger approached the station master at Aljunied MRT Station to say that banners outside the station had been vandalised.

> Investigations found that Chen had gone to the area outside the station at about 2.30am that day and wrote ""MALAY FAMILY EAT S***"" in indelible blue ink on a banner hung outside the station.

> He was caught doing so on closed-circuit television camera footage.

> The banner, which belonged to the Land Transport Authority, had to be replaced at S$240, the court heard.

> The prosecutor had asked for 14 months' jail with nine strokes of the cane and an additional 61 days' jail for the breach of remission order.

> She told the court that Chen had multiple related convictions, including committing mischief in 2013. He was also previously jailed for theft and cheating.

> RACIAL HARMONY THE BEDROCK OF PEACE: PROSECUTOR

> ""The accused chose to inscribe racially charged words onto private and public property, thereby allowing the words to be viewed repeatedly over a period of time,"" said the prosecutor. ""The accused also incorporated implied threats of death into the words that were inscribed.""

> She said that ""a strong deterrent sentence"" ought to be imposed, adding that the High Court had previously noted that offences involving racial relations needed to be deterred ""as racial harmony forms the bedrock upon which peace and progress in Singapore are founded"".

> She added that Chen was recalcitrant as he had re-offended shortly after serving his 21-month jail term for another property-related offence.

> When asked by District Judge John Ng if he had anything to say, Chen, who was not represented, said ""I think nine strokes is OK"".

> The judge said that even though Chen was ""prepared to accept the sentence"", the court would be giving a marginally reduced sentence in view of the aggregation principle, which holds that the total sentence should not be crushing on the offender.

> He ordered the permanent marker used in the offences to be forfeited to police.

> SINGAPORE - More than $50,000 worth of illegal codeine cough syrup, sleeping pills and other medicine were seized from a Geylang apartment, said the Health Sciences Authority in a statement on Wednesday (May 8).

> HSA collaborated with police officers from Bedok Police Division on Wednesday morning to conduct an enforcement operation in Geylang, seizing more than 80 litres of illegally manufactured codeine cough syrup and 32,000 tablets of assorted medicine.

> The seized tablets included sleeping pills such as midazolam, nitrazepam and diazepam, as well as other prescription medicine including codeine tablets.

> The total street value of the seized items was approximately $53,000, said HSA.

> HSA said that it had conducted surveillance after public feedback on the illegal sale of codeine cough syrup at a coffee shop in the Lorong 20 Geylang area.

> The authority then established that the illegal products were stored in an apartment on that road.

> Preliminary investigations revealed that the apartment was used to illegally manufacture and store the cough syrup and medicine, and the products had been intended for illegal sale in Geylang.

> Related Story Man nabbed over suspected theft from Bedok clinics, 18 gallons of cough syrup seized

> During the operation, two men and one woman, aged between 20 to 28, were caught inside the apartment.

> The three suspects are currently assisting HSA with investigations for manufacturing and supplying illegal medicine.

> Codeine cough syrups are used medically as a cough suppressant and can only be supplied by licensed pharmacists or medical practitioners.

> HSA enforcement branch director Annie Tan said: ""Cough syrup concoctions made in non-licensed facilities such as this Geylang apartment are dangerous and harmful to health because they are produced under poor manufacturing conditions with no proper quality controls.

> ""Consumers are advised to buy from licensed sources such as registered clinics and approved pharmacies,"" she added.

> HSA said that it takes a serious stand against illegal activities that would harm public health.

> Anyone convicted of importing, manufacturing or supplying of illegal health products, or a combination of the above, can be jailed for up to two years or fined up to $50,000, or both.

> Members of the public are encouraged to report any illegal activity involving illegal cough syrup and medicines to HSA's enforcement branch by contacting 68663485 during office hours or sending an e-mail to hsa_is@hsa.gov.sg.

In the complaint sent on March 13, Geylang allege that officials from the two clubs were spotted days before two of their matches this season.

While the clubs were not named, the complaint referred to the next game Geylang were to play - the Eagles lost to Tampines Rovers 1-0 two days after the complaint was sent - as well the first game of the season.

In their season opener, Geylang beat Albirex Niigata 1-0 on March 2. Both matches were played at OTH.

The FAS confirmed it received Geylang's complaint, and while no disciplinary measures were meted out, its competitions head Aloysius Vetha said: ""While we note that SPL stadiums are also designated as public facilities, we have reminded clubs to be mindful of the professional conduct expected of them.""

A Geylang player, who spoke to ST on condition of anonymity, said that a teammate had spotted a man allegedly manning a tripod and camera on the third floor of the OTH one day before the Albirex game. The man left shortly after being yelled at by players.

In the other incident, a member of Tampines' coaching staff was spotted sitting inside the Tampines Regional Library - a large section of which overlooks the OTH field - and was understood to have been photographed by Geylang coaches.

Geylang officials contacted their Tampines counterparts, and the man in the library left shortly after.

Geylang head coach Noor Ali declined to go into details of the two separate incidents, but said: ""This (episode) should be a learning lesson for everyone - coaches, officials and the league as a whole - about how we should hold ourselves to a certain standard of ethics and integrity.

""In over 20 years in football, I have not seen this (observing training sessions of rival teams) happen before.

""Even at a lower level, you don't see coaches walking into a school or a private academy to film or watch a training session.""

When contacted, both Tampines and Albirex refuted the accusations levelled at them. Tampines chairman Desmond Ong said: ""We are surprised that a complaint of this nature has been made. Having carried out internal checks, we are satisfied that there has been no untoward behaviour by our staff. We are happy to meet with the complainant to address any of their concerns.""

Albirex general manager Koh Mui Tee said: ""We have checked internally, we did not do it, and we have no need to resort to such methods to win games.""

This follows a similar incident two months ago in England, when a member of Leeds United's coaching staff was caught sleuthing on a Derby County training session days before the two sides met in an English Championship match, which Leeds won 2-0.

The incident was dubbed ""Spygate"" by the British press, and Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa admitted thereafter that he watched all his opponents before games, asserting that it was not illegal to do so.

His comments sparked debate on whether such a practice should be allowed, with some pundits suggesting a points deduction for the club, who are chasing promotion to the Premier League.

The English Football League fined Leeds £200,000 (S$354,170) and gave the club a formal reprimand for breaching ""good faith"", even though it said the particular incident did not break any regulation pertaining to poor conduct.",t3_b40744,22-03-2019

1489,14,ej3pgun,t3_b3yxpd,"Hi. I lived in geylang my whole life untill last month, where i moved to Katong due to expensive rent.

Yes it's safe, Geylang has been more tamed ever since the the Little India riot back in 2013 that spark policies to include surveillance camera and making sure all back alleys are litted. Speaking of surveillance camera, there's an infrared cameras installed on the bridge along geylang road, beside lorong 16. It functions as a heat detecting camera so that they can warn the police force should there be a large gathering that may spark a riot way in advance.

Main red light districts are around 16 to 12 iirc, the only one left above lorong 22 is lorong 24, where I used to live. 

Geylang js relatively safe even for women, although you will probably get sexually objectified from walking in the red light lorongs. Expats are often seen jogging around the lorongs because our ghetto is much tamer than their ghettos.

Honestly its worth staying in geylang as there's 2 mrt stations within walking distance. Though renting an apartment from lorong 26 and above are more pricer as its the ""cleaner"" side of geylang with riverfront view; you are competing with other expats that wants to live on city fringe and have access to two MRT stations.

For instance, a one bedroom studio apartment at Rezi26 is going at 1.8k/month, no nego where I could get 1.8k 2 bedroom unit at Katong.

If you are consider renting, you have a better chance negotiating lower rent at Le Regal: which is near all the brothels and illegal gambling den. You can even watch the vices happening from a bird eye view haha.

Generally the downsides is worth putting up in geylang as there are lots of 24/7 cheap coffeeshop and easy accessible to public transport. 

Feel free to ask me anything  :)",t3_b3yxpd,22-03-2019

1491,14,ej370p6,t3_b3yxpd,"Co-worker rented a condo there and I visited his place a few times for house parties. His condo was located in a quieter lane, no problems at all with the noise. Located further down from his place was a house with red lanterns, if you get my drift. A few female houseguests were comfortable enough to walk home on their own, but they were constantly scanning their surroundings. We didn't see any streetwalkers out, but then again the parties usually ended at 10 plus. Maybe the streetwalkers come out a little later?

A few housing agents mentioned to me that it's difficult to get bank loans for houses located at certain lanes. The banks either outright reject your loan or give you a much smaller amount. It's also more difficult to resell those houses on the market. ",t3_b3yxpd,22-03-2019

Geylang is very long so it’s like several neighborhoods from one end to the other. Just go around there one Friday (busy night) and one Monday (quiet night) to check how you feel about it.

Lorong below 30 and above 20 even number will be along flight path to Paya Lebar airbase. In fact most of Geylang will be exposed to F15 and C130 making rounds above few times a week.
It will be slightly noisy if you tend to stay home late in the morning till afternoon.

If you tend to close all windows and turn on AC, it shouldn’t be much of a problem. 

Personal safety is fine, walking home dead at night is safe with all the street lamps.

There are many reasons why a tree needs to be cut down, but judging from Google photos, it doesn't look like it's due to road widening or redevelopment.
