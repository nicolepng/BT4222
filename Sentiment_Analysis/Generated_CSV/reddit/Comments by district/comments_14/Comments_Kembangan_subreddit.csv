> SINGAPORE: A 26-year-old electric scooter rider was taken to hospital on Tuesday (Apr 17) after a collision involving a car in front of Kembangan MRT station along Sims Avenue East.

> The police said they were alerted at 12.50pm to the accident along Sims Avenue East towards New Upper Changi Road.

> The Singapore Civil Defence Force dispatched an ambulance, and the rider was taken conscious to Changi General Hospital.

> Channel NewsAsia understands the rider was crossing the road on his e-scooter when the incident happened, and that he subsequently suffered cuts to his head.

> Photos of the accident circulating online showed an e-scooter under the front wheel of a black Lexus, with the car’s windscreen shattered.

> Police investigations are ongoing.

> The incident comes amid a recent spate of e-scooter accidents. Also on Tuesday, an elderly woman was left with a cut and bruises after being [knocked down](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/e-scooter-knocks-down-elderly-woman-before-speeding-off-amk-10147812) by an e-scooter rider in Ang Mo Kio.

> Register with TP, which enables them to evade any responsibility in an accident quite easily.
> 
> Undergo any basic theory or practical riding lessons, which would ensure users know how to handle their PMD in a responsible manner and set a certain standard of behaviour that we, the general public should reasonably expect from them.
> 
> Have mandatory, initial and periodical inspections of their scooters by an accredited government body, which is essential to ensure that they are road-worthy, safe to ride in a public area and most importantly, won't catch fire when they're charging overnight in an enclosed area.
> 
> Mandatory insurance coverage for their PMD, which would ensure that any injured victims get compensated for their medical bills should the PMD user get involved in an accident.
> 
> Jail time for committing a serious offence with a PMD. They can also own and operate a PMD even after being convicted of an offence unlike vehicle license holders, who are generally barred from operating a vehicle for a certain period of time if they have been convicted of a serious traffic offence. IMO PMD users shouldn't be getting off that easily after being convicted for a serious offence.
