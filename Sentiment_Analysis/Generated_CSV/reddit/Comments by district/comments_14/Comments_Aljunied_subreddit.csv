In Singapore, there really isn't a culture of keeping the environment clean, unlike in Japan where most citizens carry their own plastic bags on their person in case there aren't any trash bins nearby.

From my own experience, many would just toss their trash to the side if they can't find any trash bins nearby (Which is unlikely cuz there's like trash bins everywhere). I even had the experience of hearing a mother telling their young child ""Aiya just throw your trash on the floor, the cleaner will clean it"" (The trash bin was literally a few meters away).

Likewise for reusable cups at drink vendors - these seem to be the worst, at one place I was given a drink in one of those little plastic bags, in a plastic cup, with a plastic straw, and a plastic carrier bag to take it away in. Couldn't believe it.
One of the things everyone told me about Singapore before I moved here is how clean it is. It's not bad, but it has a lot of room for improvement.

Their access to information is different, and the news they hear is very different. This year, without physical rallies and the pulling out of Mr Low, aljunied is in a precarious position of losing the chinese voter base and possibly losing the GRC.

Which brings me to my point that we need to move beyond reddit and talk to the elderly/older voters around us who may be less informed. We need to translate that information, assure them that voting WP/other opposition doesnt mean you support bad guys (trust me this is a thing). In our world, when their votes mean as much as ours, we have to do our best to engage and inform them. 

You can show them clips like pritam singing hokkien songs or Mr low's recent teochew speech. Or try explaining to them why 后生仔 like us favours WP more. Make the new WP relatable to them.

148,14,fxdpjx3,t1_fxdlwqn,"Hmm good question, i do not have an answer to that. What i share below is personal experience so please take it with a pinch of salt.

I feelis that Mr Low won a lot of votes by being very present. I was told (cannot confirm) that Mr Low or a WP rep will come visit if there is a funeral in the constituency. He also speak the teochew dialect which makes him more personable to the voters.

Many of the pioneer/merdeka generation do appreciate what the PAP leadership has done. In their lifetime, they have seen rapid economic growth and their own sons and daughters doing better than they did. They credit all this to LKY/PAP, and thus vote for PAP during the GE.

So what i guess might happen is that in absence of Mr Low, there isn't anyone that can connect to this chinese speaking MG/PG voters and they might swing to PAP instead. They dont hate PAP,  they just liked Mr Low more. If no Mr Low, then i vote PAP. I think thats how it works for them.



Also i want to clarify that my point of the precious post is to not preach to the choir. There is this group of ppl seating at home, like your grandpa and grandma, who is left out of this GE due to covid restrictions. They need more attention than the reddit population do.

Me: But a debate requires a higher level of vocab that normal conversational Mandarin skills is just not enough. Now that I moved out and no longer watch Chinese news with you all, I’m struggling now in this conversation with y’all on the GE though I have no difficulties in conversing on day-to-day topics. And I’m considered one of the better ones among my friends in speaking Mandarin.

Pa (brought up a really good point): This very issue is the result of PAP’s policies. Back then I already commented that it will be too late once they realise the loss of a language.

But let's face it, there is a deep disconnect between some PAP candidates and the layman on the ground. Sometimes, it's almost as if Victor Lye doesn't know what's the common etiquette and customs. Aside from this case, he had a photo op of him on one knee facing an uncle.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-pap-aljunied-grc-team-confident-voters-wp-12889278

I know he's trying to maintain eye level but that photo op really is kinda ridiculous. You don't have to be on one knee to serve people. Plus his recent mosquito bite on his Facebook page etc.

Returning back to the wake, I feel that it's especially weird to have the background of the certificate to have the deceased portrait there, given that the certificate is for something celebratory.

298,14,fwgkllr,t1_fwgiyhf,"Since the enactment of the Town Council Act in Singapore, the MPs run the Town Council.

This obviously creates a huge barrier to entry against the opposition in a Dominant-Party System, when a candidate that defeats the incumbent will need to take over the responsibilities of the Town Council in a short period of time, where the incumbent has very little obligation to co-operate. Predictably, this have led to a few cases where the dominant party has taken full advantage to damage the opposition.",t3_hii4af,30-06-2020
299,14,fwgxx8v,t1_fwgiyhf,"Singapore’s a city state so the “city council” is parliament lol. But each ward does have its own town council that handles the local issues in each area (the boundaries of which are redrawn every election...). So the job scope of an MP here would be much wider than simply speaking about issues in parliament. 

So a huge factor a lot of Singaporeans would put weight into while voting is whether their estate has been well managed by the incumbent MP, and other more pragmatic factors. Being a generally politically apathetic population, people don’t care what goes on in parliament. That lack of interest is also apparently why we don’t have any recordings or livestreams of parliamentary proceedings available publicly. So instead of looking at parliament performance to gauge if a candidate is favourable, you’d have to look elsewhere. 

How this dicks over the opposition is that the town council’s operations heavily favour being in the PAP’s hands, given that the entire system is built around that. You’re likely going to see a “AHTC case/trial” being brought up as a way to bring down confidence in the opposition’s competency to run their town council. Plus, in the past opposition wards would have less amenities compared to pap wards, like less lift upgradings/sheltered walkways etc. This was a tactic used to dissuade the population from voting for opposition - do you want your neighbourhood to become a “slum”? While this isn’t true anymore in the present day, the mindset is still pervasive. 

If you’re going to follow the elections, you’ve probably got to taper yourself a bit regarding the results. By democratic country standards it’s going to be a landslide victory for the incumbent party PAP. The interesting aspect is the margin by which the opposition loses.",t3_hii4af,30-06-2020

He knew my family well as my dad always approached him for his PR issues and he always did his best to help my dad by personally writing letters constantly to ICA and the government while keeping my dad posted. Few times a year he would bring my dad out for coffee at a nearby coffeeshop to just chat and listen to my dad’s concerns and whenever I met him in Meet-the-MP sessions he would always spend a few minutes talking to me and give me candy(I was a small boy back then). Due to his persistence even though the application will get rejected in the end there was at least information coming back to my family every now and then about the situation. When he lost in 2011 and promptly retired, my parents were obv heartbroken. During the night his PAP left our GRC for good he had a van bringing him and his other team members going around saying final goodbyes. My dad and I heard it and immediately rush out of the house and chased the van an entire street down before catching up as he stopped before the exit to the main road to bid farewell to a small crowd forming and cheering for him. Just before the van was about to go he saw and looked at my dad, nodded and said “Goodbye my dear friend” and the van left. Under WP however go to LTK though showed concern and looked like he really wanted to help and even also wrote a letter to ICA and govt but this time different. No letter no follow up and application was somehow rejected faster than before this time. so therefore ya even though technically still the same, it is tougher in being under opposition.

327,14,ghl4sun,t3_knkc0k,"From the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Singaporeans):

> The Singapore Hadramis were major landlords, the large families having substantial properties held in trust, which ranged from private family trusts to public charitable trusts. Most of the land in today’s central business district of Singapore was once owned by Hadrami wakafs. These wakafs, bearing the family names, whether private or charitable, gave considerable prestige to the Arab community among the Muslims in Singapore. In recent years, four factors have affected the wakafs and undermined the status of the community. The first three factors have been a direct result of government policies.
>
> The first was the enactment of the Administration of Muslim Law Act 1968. The Singapore Islamic Council is the corporate body now empowered to oversee the administration of charitable wakafs in Singapore. Prior to the Act, the Arab trustees were in total control of their wakafs. With the transfer of the wakafs’ administration to the Council, the Arabs’ authority over them was considerably undermined. The association of wakafs with the Arabs and their reputation as benefactors diminished as the public no longer saw their connection with the charitable functions of the wakafs.
>
>The second factor was the Rent Control Act 1947. The rents of pre-war properties were controlled and, in effect, frozen. As the Arab wakafs were mostly pre-war properties, the income of the Arab families have correspondingly diminished. The decline in the income from the wakafs resulted in the diminishing economic influence of the Arabs. The Arabs were also not prepared for such a drastic drop in their income. They had not given their children a Western education. Many Arabs went to madrasas or Islamic schools and some families never sent their children for any formal education at all. The changing developments that started taking place in Singapore since the 1960s has made it difficult for the Arabs to compete.
>
>The third factor was the Land Acquisition Act. Given the size of the island, land is scarce in Singapore and it has been the government’s policy to have complete control over land usage. The Land Acquisition Act empowered the government to acquire land required for urban renewal and compensation to be paid on a predetermined formula. The compensation amounts calculated would be significantly lower than the prevailing market value. The government embarked on a major acquisition campaign in the 1970s and 1980s. Pre-war properties were the major target for acquisition as Singapore underwent a modernisation programme. These pre-war properties were subject to rent control and had tenants that could not be removed.
>
>The wakafs were not in a position to develop these properties. Significant properties owned by Arab wakafs were acquired and minimal compensation paid. This eroded Arab wealth and influence. It also diminished the Arab identity as substantial landlords.
>
>The Sheikh Salem Talib Family settlement, for example, used to have more than three pages in its audited accounts listing the properties held, but the current accounts have less than one page. More than half of the properties were acquired by the government. The al-Saggoff Perseverance Estate was acquired in 1962 for urban renewal. Another 10-acre (40,000 m2) plot of land in a prime area was donated by the al-Junied family to the Muslim Trust Fund (a wakaf created by the al-Saggoffs) to be developed so that the income could be used for welfare projects. The Trust wanted to build a mosque and a madrasah, but building permission was not granted by the government. That piece of land was acquired in 1985. In present-day Singapore, the Arabs are no longer considered as the main landowners. Many Singapore Arabs regard the land acquisition policy as the main reason for both their loss of status and identity.
>
>The fourth factor is the use of professional trustees to manage the wakafs instead of family members. Most of the large private family trusts had problems of mismanagement or breaches of trust and legal disputes. In many cases a professional trustee was then appointed, which had a similar effect to the Administration of Muslim Law Act: the management of the wakafs became impersonal and the Arab families lost the social status of being associated with them.",t3_knkc0k,31-12-2020

>  
> The 48-year-old Swede, who has lived in Singapore for about 28 years,  adds: ""Practically, it might not be the best option as the theatre  industry is tough. But if you really know for sure, if you can't live  without it and are prepared to starve or make sacrifices for it, then,  okay.""

Ya because when the PAP MP goes to those PA events they usually go as a grassroot adviser(which is appointed by the ruling party which appoints the losers of the election to the position if the constituency isn't won by the PAP).

>  
>Apr 6, 2020  
>  
>Mr Pritam Singh: To ask the Minister for National Development how much Community Improvement Projects Committee funding was applied for and allocated to each grassroots adviser and/or Citizens' Consultative Committee from FY2016 to date.  
>  
>Answer:  
>  
>The Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) provides funding support for improvement projects in HDB estates for the benefit of local residents. Such facilities include covered walkways, footpaths, playgrounds and bicycle racks.  
>  
>The CIPC sets aside budget for the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) each year based on the number of HDB residential units in each constituency. The CCCs can decide how to utilise these funds for their projects, and have to raise their own funds to co-pay 10% of the project costs.    
>  
>As the Town Councils have to maintain the completed CIPC projects that are built on HDB common property, the CCCs also have to seek the Town Councils’ agreement to maintain the infrastructure before construction work can commence.  
>  
>**It is not meaningful to compare CIPC funding across CCCs as every constituency is different and their residents have different needs.** This is why the CIPC generally lets the CCCs, who are closer to the ground, decide on the selection of the projects to best meet the needs of the residents.

One would think that the so-called ""upgrading carrot"", often used in  past election campaigns, has reached the end of its shelf life.

Yet, with elections approaching, a delay in the completion of a  barrier-free access ramp in an opposition ward has unexpectedly put the  focus once again on party politics in grassroots organisations and the  allocation of resources for community improvement projects.

The root of the issue is a barrier-free access ramp at Block 108  Bedok Reservoir Road in Aljunied GRC. It took seven years to finish  building the ramp.

Workers' Party (WP) secretary-general Pritam Singh, who is the MP for  the constituency, revealed the issue in a Facebook post two weeks ago,  along with his criticism that Mr Chua Eng Leong, a People's Action Party  (PAP) candidate who had lost in the previous elections and was  subsequently installed as grassroots adviser, had deliberately  obstructed attempts by opposition MPs to implement upgrading projects.

Mr Singh also questioned whether it was appropriate for opposition  MPs, who had received a legitimate mandate from the people, to have to  seek approval from grassroots advisers for the disbursement of community  upgrading funds.

In fact, this was not the first time the opposition had complained  about being hampered by grassroots advisers appointed by the People's  Association (PA).

> SINGAPORE: Some residents in Aljunied and Hougang want personal mobility devices (PMD) banned from HDB void decks and common areas, but the Workers' Party-run Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) said on Friday (Aug 16) that it already has ""powers"" to deter people from riding such devices in common areas.

> This comes after Senior Minister of State for Transport Lam Pin Min announced in Parliament on Aug 5 that all 15 People's Action Party (PAP) town councils will implement the ban, which means riders will have to dismount and push their PMDs in those areas.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> On Aug 7, PAP town council coordinating chairman Teo Ho Pin said in a statement that the ban will kick in on Sep 1, after amendments to town council by-laws on common property and open spaces.

> Under the amended by-laws, the town councils can fine these PMD riders or take them to court.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> While AHTC did not confirm either way if it would implement the ban, it told CNA that it already has the ""powers to deter PMDs from riding at common areas"".

> ""However, enforcing these powers without evidence of an infraction is a challenge,"" it said in response to queries.

> It added that it has implemented a two-pronged approach to reduce irresponsible PMD use.

> ""Firstly, the town council has stepped up on educational efforts to remind PMD users to be considerate and to dismount and push their PMDs at the lift lobbies and void decks,"" it said.

> ""Secondly, residents who observe errant PMD riders are encouraged to use LTA's new app (feature) to spot, snap and send (a report).""

> Separately, AHTC said it is working with the Land Transport Authority to implement pedestrian-only zones in its district.

> Dr Lam had said in Parliament that the zones will first be trialled in Bedok, Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Batok, Khatib and Tampines.

> RESIDENTS WANT BAN IMPLEMENTED

> Of 11 Aljunied and Hougang residents CNA spoke to on Thursday, nine said they want the ban implemented, citing the safety of children and the elderly. Several residents also said that they have had near-miss incidents and witnessed reckless riding.

> Residents living in Aljunied's Kaki Bukit division, near a Bedok North food centre and McDonald's outlet where PMD riders regularly hang out, said the ban should be implemented at their blocks and common areas.

> ""There are blind spots. Kids are running everywhere and they might get hit. It's quite dangerous,"" said technical manager Tan Yap Chong, 39.

> Mr Tan, who was almost hit once by a speeding PMD while coming out of a lift, is now careful to always keep his six-year-old son close to him.

> An elderly man walking post the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council office in Bedok North. (Photo: Aqil Haziq Mahmud)

> Retiree Goh Choon Thiang, 51, said he was involved in a similar near-miss incident at his lift lobby. ""There might be pregnant women here,"" he said. ""If they are hit, who is going to answer?

> ""Although it’s very convenient to use PMDs to travel from point A to point B, you have to use it properly. Don’t cause harm to others because of your own convenience.""

> Homemaker Jennifer Lee, 70, said she has seen PMDs speeding through sheltered walkways.

> ""I’ve seen a lot of old people with walking aids exercising near the void decks,"" she added. ""The ban should be implemented all over Singapore to cut down on these PMD incidents.""

> A food delivery rider at a common corridor. (Photo: Aqil Haziq Mahmud)

> While another resident who only wanted to be known as Shafie said he was supportive of the ban, he added that first-time offenders should preferably be let off with a warning, with food delivery riders given more leniency.

> ""If the rules are too tight, then they cannot work,"" said the 36-year-old, who himself delivers food on a motorcycle. ""But if the offenders are kids riding dangerously for fun, they should be punished. Those who are repeatedly reckless should be fined and have their devices confiscated.""

> 

> PMD riders near Hougang. (Photo: Aqil Haziq Mahmud)

> Retiree Jamaludin Mohd, however, said that not all food delivery riders are mindful, noting that they are usually ""rushing against time"".

> ""Last time, PMDs were used to go from place to place,"" the 70-year-old said, just as a rider who was on his mobile phone turned a blind corner.

> ""Now, it’s also used for food delivery. When it’s business, they ride fast (but) we shouldn’t have near-misses. We must eliminate this from happening. If not, prevent it.""

> ENFORCEMENT ALSO NEEDED

> Nevertheless, residents said the ban will only be effective if it is enforced.

> Hougang resident Danny Sim, an engineer, said a ban ""with no action taken is redundant"". ""The ban should be implemented, but who is going to enforce?"" the 35-year-old asked.

> Mr Goh said there are so many cameras that authorities will not be able to monitor each and every location.

> ""They should depend on public reporting and law enforcement coming down to take a look,"" he said.

> Police cameras will be used to catch PMD riders who flout the ban at void decks and common areas. (Photo: Aqil Haziq Mahmud)

> Meanwhile, most of the residents acknowledged that reckless users made up only a small number of the PMD community.

> Aljunied resident M Nishathini, 21, said she does not think PMDs should be banned at void decks as she believes most riders would ride safely in residential areas.

> ""When there are people, they will know to ride slow,"" she added.

> Engineer Aditya Krishna, 35, said he's been involved in near-miss incidents ""not at void decks, but at footpaths where it’s allowed"".

> ""So, it’s not about the location, but the rider and his behaviour.""

> SINGAPORE — Aljunied residents are “clear and aware” about the saga surrounding the Workers’ Party-led Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) and will make their own judgments, said a People’s Action Party (PAP) branch chairman on Sunday (Nov 10).

> Mr Alex Yeo Sheng Chye, the chairman of the Paya Lebar branch within the Opposition-held ward, told reporters on the sidelines of the PAP65 Awards and Conference that he trusts that residents will be able to discern for themselves what kind of elected representative they want.

> Last month, the High Court ruled that WP leaders Low Thia Khiang, Sylvia Lim and Pritam Singh are liable for damages suffered by the AHTC and the Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council. In particular, the judge found that Ms Lim and Mr Low had breached their fiduciary duties to the AHTC, “as they had failed to act in AHTC’s best interests and had acted for extraneous purposes”.

> Last week, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat urged Parliament to hold the WP and two of its top leaders accountable for their roles in the saga, and called on Ms Lim and Mr Low to “recuse themselves” from all financial matters related to the town council.

> Asked how residents viewed the AHTC saga after DPM Heng’s parliamentary motion was passed last week, Mr Yeo said that both sides — the PAP and WP — have aired their own views of the episode.

> “On the ground, I think Aljunied residents are very clear and aware of what the situation is — they live in Aljunied after all and I trust them. They will make the judgment themselves and (decide) what kind of representatives they want for themselves in Parliament,” said Mr Yeo, a 40-year-old lawyer. He had replaced Mr Murali Pillai as PAP's Paya Lebar branch chairman following the latter's victory in the Bukit Batok by-election in 2016.

> “As for us PAP activists, we continue being focused on only one thing, to work very hard, with sincerity, and to show them that we will be here no matter how hard it is, we will be here serving them.”

> Mr Yeo was one of four PAP activists who spoke at the conference, where he highlighted his team’s activities over the years, such as giving out meal vouchers to Aljunied residents.

>

> He told reporters: “It takes a lot of time and that is really what our motto in Opposition wards is about. We build and rebuild relationships one at a time, and however long it takes, we will still be there.”

> PAP ACTIVISTS

> The other activists who spoke were businesswoman Rachel Ong Sin Yen, 47; senior lecturer Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, 40; and lawyer Kawal Pal Singh, 36.

> At the conference, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong exhorted party activists to be prepared for a ""tough fight"" ahead and to convince Singaporeans of the PAP's cause.

> Asked about the coming polls, activist Ong said that she and other members of the PAP Telok Blangah branch have been engaging with residents, such as thinking about how to help seniors integrate better in the community.

> Ms Ong is the chief executive officer of consultancy firm Rohei and is also the chairman of social service agency Trybe, which works with disadvantaged youths.

> Another activist, Dr Wan Rizal from the PAP Pasir Ris East branch, said his branch members have been “working hard” even as Opposition parties have been walking the grounds.

> “I think at the end of the day, it's about connecting with the people… understanding them and I think we've been doing really well.""

> “I can see that the members are battle-hardened. (It’s) nice to see this, and I feel like the members are confident,"" added the 40-year-old senior lecturer at Republic Polytechnic.

> Mr Singh has been serving the PAP’s Kembangan-Chai Chee branch, assisting Marine Parade GRC MP Tan Chuan-Jin in his meet-the-people sessions as a volunteer and later as a party activist.

> The Institute of Technical Education (ITE) graduate shared how despite his average results in his N-Levels, ITE became a turning point in his life and led to him becoming a lawyer.

> When asked if they would be fielded in the next General Election, which must be held by April 2021, Ms Ong and Mr Singh said they were unable to comment. Mr Singh said: “That would be the prerogative of the party.”

Ok I flipped at this one.

Not only because that Victor Lye said that Aljunied has been held hostage, but because he is such a joke in the GRC. All these wayang tactics, like what getting stung by mosquitoes during his walkabout, kneeling down before cameras, talking rubbish...

https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/%5Bofficial%5D-pap-victor-lye-thiam-fatts-fan-club-6167485-22.html

I would like to see him claim what achievements he has made in these how many years he has been in Aljunied GRC, instead of doing all these mudslinging and photo ops.

Seriously? Has our ruling party degenerated to a party which can only win through votes through questionable methods like what Murali Pillai has done (claimed without evidence whatsoever about a phantom post that is an attack on his family shortly after his nomination), assuring over and over that opposition parties are guaranteed a voice as NCMPs so no need to elect them, doing lots of character assassinations (like CSJ, LTK) over the years and so on?

I really hate to say this, but this is getting ridiculous! Singapore has progressed so much at a cost, most of its citizens have sacrificed so much in a high cost of living place, having to keep up with societal pressures, and a 'can die cannot get sick' mentality for so long, and now all we are seeing is the ruling party doing all these?

I feel that Singapore is akin to a pressure cooker right now, and throwing shade is like downing each other in poison, to see who dies first so you are the winner. This applies not only for politics, but for workplaces, schools, relationships, family, friends and so on. There's so much toxicity going on!

And what's the worst part? The opposition seem to actually be doing less of these mudslinging, reverse psychology whatnot than the ruling party! I mean if you ask me 10 years ago, before the 2011 elections, would I have imagined this, I would never say it's possible!

But maybe LKY already envisioned this when he said this:

>Q How confident are you that Singapore will survive you?

>Mr Lee All I can say is I think Singapore is safe for 10 years. No trouble because there's a team in place that will handle it. Whether it will be 15, 20, 30 years depends on them getting a team of players very soon. __Part of the team is in place but you need a leader man. You need somebody who can communicate, who can mobilise people, move people. It's not enough to have a good policy. You got to convince people.__

>Q What about beyond 10 years?

>Mr Lee I think there will come a time when eventually the public will say, look, let's try the other side, either __because the PAP has declined in quality or the opposition has put up a team which is equal to the PAP and they say, let's try the other side. It must come.__

https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/singapores-future-according-to-lee-kuan-yew

I agree with LKY completely. There's no such thing as an unchangeable thing. Just look at USSR becoming Russia, and the opening of China by Deng Xiaoping.

Yes. On the sidelines as ""Grassroots advisors"" in opposition wards and still doing a lot of stuffs.

&#x200B;

This is from Pritam Singh's FB. Since here doesn't allow FB links. I copied and paste. It's a TLDR explanation but for those in non opposition ward, it's nice to read how the grassroots is like over there

>Democracy: P.A.(P) Style  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There was an interesting opinion piece published in the Straits Times today, originally written by a Lianhe Zaobao reporter on 26 Oct. Amongst others, this perspective in particular stood out:

""Judging from ongoing public discussions about this issue, most voters do not fully understand or care much about the delicate coexistence between opposition town councils and the PA.

The logic of voters is simple: The construction of a barrier-free access ramp to benefit the elderly and disabled was delayed, and if it involves grassroots politics, then it must be a violation of fair play, and it is unacceptable to sacrifice the interests of citizens in the process.""

In making the first claim, the writer seems to have missed or ignored the larger point on how the appointment of losing PAP candidates as P.A. Grassroots Advisers compromises our democracy. In making the second point on fairness, it follows that the position of the P.A. in opposition wards cannot only be confined to the narrow remit of an indifferent attitude in constructing barrier-free ramps.

It is no secret that losing PAP Grassroots Advisers do not just hold sway over taxpayer dollars for upgrading. Their real power and influence is far more fundamental, and political. In fact, it goes to the substance of what it means to have ""free and fair elections"".

1. Losing PAP candidates are appointed by the PAP Government to preside over citizenship ceremonies for new voters in their capacity as Grassroots Advisers. In opposition wards, one of the first experiences of new Singaporeans citizens in our politics is to receive their pink ICs from losing PAP candidates. Shouldn't a civil servant under the fiat of the President or a non-political individual at the very least preside over such ceremonies?

2. Town Councils are meant to stand on two legs. The first leg is represented by the elected MPs, and second represented by grassroots leaders. When Town Councils were raised, it was not only for the purpose of transferring power from HDB to elected MPs, but crucially, to grassroots leaders as well. The PAP government does not recognise any grassroots representatives unless they come under the P.A. umbrella. Opposition volunteers are not accorded the status of grassroots by the PAP. So in opposition wards, there are no grassroots representatives on the Town Council. That more than a few opposition TCs have ploughed on in such a political environment speaks for itself. And in opposition wards, grassroots leaders come under the control of Grassroots Advisers and are appointed by losing PAP candidates.

3. In the absence of P.A. approved CIPC funding, opposition Town Councils have to rely on their own surpluses to fund improvement projects for residents, like AHTC has done this year. Doing so invariably eats into TC surpluses that can be used for other needs/purposes, while PAP Town Councils can rely on CIPC funding and/or keep their surpluses intact or tap on a lesser amount compared to opposition wards. In the court of public opinion, this matters, because when AHTC ran deficits in the years after 2011, the question even the Straits Times asked was - what happened to the $3m surplus from the previous Aljunied Town Council?

Does the PAP use the P.A. to put its political interests ahead of the interests of Singaporeans? The answer is as clear as day, and I hope more journalists and political observers look beyond Singapore's most famous ramp and analyse the political system that delayed its construction. Because as the ""logic of the voters"" dictates, shouldn't constructive politics be about fairness?",t3_hj63k7,01-07-2020

> “In this election, we want to bring the people of Aljunied to the national table. We cannot be on the sidelines for another five years. This is a crisis and we need to chart a very special way for Singapore to go forward,” he said.

> “We can see the cries for help that come through the internet, we see a younger generation that need jobs. Let’s care about that first. And the people of Aljunied (need) representatives to do that for them,” Mr Lye added.

> Mr Perera and Mr Giam have replaced WP stalwarts Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Chen Show Mao, who are both not contesting in the polls.

> When asked whether the absence of Mr Low and Mr Chen will change PAP’s campaign strategy or boost PAP's chances, Mr Lye said: ""The answer is no, flatly no. We have never looked at who is on the other side. We look at our residents, always.""

> ""We also look at those that have been given the chance to serve and how they have served. And we look, we understand. We think we can do better. The people will decide,"" he added.

> Mr Lye, Mr Chua and Mr Shamsul were all part of PAP’s team that narrowly lost to WP in the 2015 election. WP clinched victory with 50.96 per cent of the vote.

> WP first won Aljunied GRC in 2011 from the PAP, resulting in the departure of former Cabinet minister George Yeo. That year, PAP saw its nationwide vote share fall to 60.1 per cent.

> “We serve as volunteers, and if the Workers’ Party would like to represent as volunteers, I think you know the national sentiment -12 NCMP seats, full voting rights,” said Mr Chua.

> On Tuesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted that however Singaporeans vote at the General Election, there will be at least 12 opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) due to the Non-Constituency MP (NCMP) scheme.

> PAP candidate for Aljunied GRC Shamsul Kamar speaking to residents on Wednesday (Jul 1). (Photo: Try Sutrisno Foo)

> The NCMP scheme, started in 1984, guarantees a minimum number of opposition MPs in Parliament. After the last General Election, this number was raised from nine to 12 and the voting rights of NCMPs were enhanced.

> On Mr Pritam's comments that the election could be more challenging for opposition parties, amid talk of a possible wipeout in Parliament, Mr Lye said: “Aljunied has been held hostage for too long. It has been nine years, the residents can see. It’s time they gave us a chance.”

> When asked to comment on how the team has been labelled as a “suicide squad”, PAP new candidate Mr Yeo said: “We don’t concentrate on labels. Our focus is only on our residents.”

> Mr Yeo added that even though the PAP team could not find any government funds to tap on and it does not run the town council, they have raised their own funds and extended help to residents and organisations in the area.
