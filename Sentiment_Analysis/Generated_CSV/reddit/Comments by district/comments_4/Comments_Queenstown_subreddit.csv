>A five-room Housing Board resale flat in Holland Drive was sold for $1.1 million this month, setting a new record for the area even as HDB resale prices fell for the sixth consecutive quarter.

>Built under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (Sers), the 38th storey unit at Block 18C in Holland Drive is the second flat to be sold above $1 million in less than a year.

>In July last year, a unit between the 34th and 36th storey in neighbouring Block 18D was sold for $1.03 million.

>Analysts said the $1.1 million sale is a new record achieved for regular five-room flats after a high level unit at Pinnacle@Duxton in the city centre sold for $1.14 million in November last year.

>The 1,259 sq ft unit in Block 18C has a remaining lease of 93 years. The price works out to about $874 per sq ft on the built up area.

>Its price is 16 per cent above that of a similar unit on the 37th storey in the same block, which sold for $945,000 last November.

>ERA Realty's Joyyce Goh, the seller's agent, said: ""Holland is a prime area for both private and public housing. This unit is located between two MRT stations, Buona Vista and Holland Village.""

>While certain classes of public housing - like executive apartments, those built under the Design, Build and Sell Scheme and flats at the Pinnacle@Duxton - tend to fetch high prices, it is rarer for regular five-room flats to sell above $1 million.

>ERA Realty key executive officer Eugene Lim added: ""Holland Drive is a part of the Queenstown area. And Queenstown has traditionally been a popular district with buyers, due to its amenities and proximity to the city centre. Hence, it is one of the few places in Singapore where flats have breached the million-dollar mark.

>""Certainly, this transaction will become the new yardstick for potential buyers and sellers in the same housing estate.

>""However, it is just one transaction, and this unit has exceptional characteristics such as a high floor and a Holland Village address. So, it is unlikely to affect the pricing dynamics of Queenstown too much.""

>The highest price recorded for public housing is $1.18 million, for a five-room DBSS flat in Bishan.

>The unit in Block 273B Bishan Street 24, which has 93 years left on its lease, was sold in February last year.

>More of such sales may occur as the collective sale fever intensifies and buyers are on the lookout for replacement flats with good attributes in prime areas, analysts said.

>The Straits Times understands the buyers of the Block 18C unit are Singaporeans who had lived in a private property and wanted to downgrade.

>""They wanted to buy in Districts 9 or 10, which are premium areas. You can't find anything of this size with this unblocked view, and it was a renovated unit,"" PropNex agent Stanley Ho said.

> Queenstown could get 5,000 new flats by 2027

> 2,060 of them may be launched as early as 2021 or 2022, HDB tender documents show

> More than 5,000 new homes could be l aunched i n Queenstown by 2027, based on details in a traffic study that will be conducted for Singapore’s oldest town.

> The Housing Board called a tender for a traffic impact assessment (TIA) on Monday.

> According to tender documents, about 2,060 of these homes in two developments could be launched as early as 2021 or 2022.

> Another 3,280 units across four developments are expected to be pushed out five years later.

> In total, there are 10 development sites comprising 7,147 proposed units, up to 6,600 sq m for commercial use, and a primary school.

> The documents did not say when the other 1,807 units would be launched. The developments span 29ha in all.

> The tender documents did not specify t he locations of these homes, but said the developments could be served by new roads connected to Queensway, Portsdown Avenue, the Ayer Rajah Expressway and Alexandra Road.

> The diamond-shaped area, which is likely the site of the developments, is now largely a swathe of greenery, save for Alexandra Hospital, Queensway Shopping Centre, Alexandra Fire Station and Hang Jebat Mosque.

> It has been earmarked for residential use in the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s masterplan.

> Among other things, the study aims to assess the junctions likely to be affected by traffic coming from the proposed developments during peak hours, and make recommendations to ease congestion.

> An HDB spokesman said yesterday that the TIA is “part of the planning process for any parcel of land” to see what transport infrastructure is needed.

> “The TIA study at Queenstown is for proposed future comprehensive development that includes residential units,” she said, without specifying how many of the 7,000 units would be public housing.

> More information will be provided when detailed plans are ready, she added.

> The tender, which closes on Oct 29, means Queenstown, which has some of the most expensive HDB resale flats in Singapore, could receive an injection of new public flats soon.

> While about 3,700 flats should be completed by next year in the mature estate, these are meant to replace old Tanglin Halt units under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme.

> The last Build-To-Order (BTO) launch for Queenstown was the 1,179-unit Ghim Moh Edge in November 2012.

> Before that, the HDB released 1,718 units for SkyTer[email protected]son and [email protected]son in December 2009.

> Real estate professor Sing Tien Foo of the National University of Singapore said the tender details may prove useful for couples eyeing a home in an estate that rarely sees the launch of new HDB flats.

> “Sometimes, people make decisions without any knowledge of future supply,” he said. “Here, you know this is a likely spot for new flats, around this period, and they can take it from there.”

> But Dr Steven Choo, veteran urban planner and chairman of real estate advisory firm Vestasia Group, advised would-be buyers to be circumspect.

> “Seven thousand units sound like a big number, but they will be staggered across several developments and over a period of time,” he said. “It’s not like there is a sudden influx of flats in the mature estate.”

> OrangeTee & Tie research head Christine Sun said that the timing of the launch of the Queenstown flats is critical.

> She noted that the Greater Southern Waterfront is another upcoming and desirable precinct. It will occupy the existing Keppel Club site, where 9,000 public and private flats will be built after the club’s lease expires in two years.

> “We expect the Greater Southern Waterfront and Queenstown HDB flats to be priced higher than usual BTOs, but if many BTOs in ‘hot’ areas are launched around the same time, it would raise the median price of new flats.

> “This, in turn, could raise resale prices,” she said.

108,3,e7ngq8l,t1_e7mkn82,Foreigner can be deported. Local will stick around and potentially cause trouble again down the line. That's really all the difference there is.,t3_9ni6af,12-10-2018
