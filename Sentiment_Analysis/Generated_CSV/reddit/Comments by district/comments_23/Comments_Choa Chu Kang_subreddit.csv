> Panty-sniffing IG account

> On Aug. 15, an Instagram user in Singapore started posting images of allegedly stolen panties and shorts.

> The first post has a series of him posing with a pair of pink thongs, as well as some shots of him sniffing it.

> These photos were apparently taken at Tampines Street 33.

> From Tampines to Choa Chu Kang

> And it seems that he has also travelled to Choa Chu Kang for this pair of shorts.

> According to his caption, he allegedly released “3 days worth of load” on the shorts aptly (and unfortunately) branded Something Borrowed:

> The likelihood of this Instagram account being real and not a troll thing is unknown.

> If it is real, what the man is doing is highly illegal as it clearly compromises public health.

> If it is fake, it is disturbing enough for someone to call the police.

> Anyone convicted of causing public nuisance under Section 290 of the Penal Code may be punished with a fine of up to S$1,000.

> A 62-year-old man became abusive and agitated after he was told to put on his mask, resulting in the Singapore police being called to the scene.

> The incident took place at Block 673B Choa Chu Kang Crescent on Feb. 14 at about 10am, Shin Min Daily News reported.

> What happened

> The man who refused to mask up was witnessed to have tried purchasing a beverage from the drink stall at a coffee shop and was persuaded to put on a mask by the stall assistant.

> However, he proceeded to throw a straw at the assistant while arguing back loudly and not complying with the request to mask up.

> A 52-year-old taxi driver who saw what happened stepped in to intervene, but ended up on the receiving end of more abuse from the man without his mask.

> The group then called the police.

> The taxi driver subsequently tipped Shin Min off regarding what happened.

> The 58-year-old stall assistant said she only told the man to wear a mask in the interest of other diners, according to Shin Min.

> She said: ""He has such a bad temper, it makes people helpless.""

> Police wanted to man to wear mask

> The police that arrived at the scene wanted the man to wear his mask, but he refused and put up a struggle, which reportedly lasted an hour.

> Photos that Shin Min published of the incident showed the man being subdued by the police, and made to sit on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back.

> The police took the man into the patrol car but he put up a struggle, Shin Min reported.

> The man's wife then showed up and explained to the staff that her husband was acting out because he was feeling stressed.

> The man had reportedly already clashed with others more than 10 times prior to this incident, it was reported.

> Each time he was told to mask up, he would create a scene.

> The police said a 62-year-old man was arrested for public nuisance and injuries to public officials.

> The police are investigating the case.

The closest I found that could exist in Singapore would be any spoilt dairy product (eg. cow milk, ghee, butter, Parmesan cheese etc.) since it produces the same chemical found in vomit (Butyric acid). It's also possible for breast milk to smell of puke if left in the open. 

The other surprising thing which I found that smells of vomit would be yankee candles, i.e. those scented candles that are burnt for nice aromas. Likewise, they'll smell bad if unused past their due date. 

If it's a specific time in a residential estate, then someone could be putting their expired goods out in the open...or maybe I'm overthinking and someone is getting wasted and puking at that time.

268,23,dyoii7o,t3_8i2xt6,"SINGAPORE — At 24km long, with 24 stations, the Republic's seventh MRT line, Jurong Region Line (JRL), will open in three phases from 2026.

Slated to commence operations the year the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail is scheduled for completion, the JRL will connect the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Pandan Reservoir and Tengah area to the existing Choa Chu Kang and Boon Lay stations.

Unveiling the JRL alignment during a work site visit to the upcoming Canberra station on the North-South Line (NSL) on Wednesday (May 9), Transport Minister and Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure Khaw Boon Wan called the new line ""a quantum leap"" for Jurong's transport infrastructure.

The new line, which will run above ground, together with the upcoming KL-Singapore High Speed Rail, will give commuters ""convenient connections not just within western Singapore, but also to Malaysia"", he said, complementing the development of the Jurong Lake District into the ""largest commercial hub"" outside the Central Business District, alongside development of the new Jurong Innovation District into the ""next generation industrial estate"".

""When all these plans come together, Jurong will be a waterfront business hub nestled in greenery, served by good public transport connections, as well as amenities to support active mobility … This is our vision for Jurong,"" Mr Khaw added.

While the JRL improves the area's connectivity, the minister noted that it will also bring ""resilience"" to the entire MRT network. 



This is as commuters will have more choices when any of the two main lines, North-South Line or East-West Line (EWL), breaks down, since the JRL is connected to both Choa Chu Kang and Boon Lay.

""This will help to also distribute and relieve train loading between Choa Chu Kang and Jurong East stations, so that commuters can enjoy more comfortable rides,"" he added.

The Jurong area is currently connected by roads via the Pan Island Expressway and the Ayer Rajah Expressway. By train, the area is served by Lakeside, Boon Lay, and Jurong East stations, as well as Joo Koon and Tuas stations, which came into service in 2009 and 2017 respectively as extensions to the EWL.

On Wednesday, Mr Khaw also separately announced that Canberra Station, the new MRT stop between Sembawang and Yishun stations on the NSL, is expected to open for service by December next year, ""hopefully before Christmas"".

The construction of the station located along Canberra Link in Sembawang is on track to be completed for testing and commissioning in October next year.

Works commenced in early 2016, and to date, the station is 55 per cent completed, with more than 1.3 million man hours put in.

Canberra Station is the second station to be integrated onto an operational MRT line, with EWL's Dover station being the first.

Its addition will also put 17,000 more households within a 10-minute walk of a train station, putting the Ministry of Transport closer on its goal to bring eight in 10 households within that radius by 2030.",t3_8i2xt6,09-05-2018
