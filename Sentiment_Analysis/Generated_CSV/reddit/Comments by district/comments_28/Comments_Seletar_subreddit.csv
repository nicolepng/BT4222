The more compact size also makes it easier to shoot without a tripod, such as when you're taking multiple shots while travelling around on foot or on a bike. Reduces fatigue in the wrists, smaller size, all also help to reduce camera shake to an extent. 

Also the function of the digital shutter reduces the shake experienced in a DSLR when the prism flips during a shot.

Of course there are many opinions as to which would be the better choice for landscape photography. Just highlighting my own reasons why I chose it, at the same time, I do understand those who prefer DSLRs for a whole different set of reasons. ",t3_b9obbk,05-04-2019

That makes no sense at all. On a full frame, you get twice as much light, so you can go one stop higher with the same exposure time as you would with a crop sensor.

Also, APS-C == crop.",t3_b9obbk,06-04-2019
49,28,ek8nu61,t1_ek8myvy,"For landscape photography, you want to have a higher aperture value so more of the image is in focus. When you set a full frame and a mirrorless to the same aperture value and shutter speed, the mirrorless will have more of the image in focus due to the crop factor. 

And for the last part, I'm not saying full frame=aps-c. I'm merely making a comparison between Olympus mirrorless (M43) to other sensors which have smaller crop factor (1 for full frame and about 1.5-1.6 for aps)",t3_b9obbk,06-04-2019

source: https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/9cqshq/how_does_crop_factor_affect_aperture/e5dhh6x?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

There have been many discussion threads on what full frame sensors actually affect, and they do not change the brightness of an image. The settings on a mirrorless can be translated directly on to a full frame camera and the same image brightness will be achieved. The sensor is bigger and technically more light is hitting it's surface, but it's spread out through it's larger area. The amount of light hitting each pixel is still the same when compared to the one in a cropped sensor camera. The only difference is in the field of view of the image captured, and the bokeh depth of field effect. Which is what I was highlighting when I said that I prefer mirrorless over a DSLR (whether with a smaller crop factor or a fill frame)",t3_b9obbk,06-04-2019
51,28,ek8olfg,t1_ek8nu61,"If you set a full frame and a crop camera to the same aperture value and shutter speed, the full frame image will be significantly more exposed than the crop image. You can therefore go one f-stop higher on the FF (compared to APS-C)

52,28,ek8or80,t1_ek8olfg,"I'm not that sure on the first point, I've read some accounts that mention sensor size doesn't not affect image exposure. 

Yes while the concept of depth of field is in z axis, different parts of the image are of different distances to the lens. When you have a deeper depth of field, more of the image around the x/y axis will appear to be in focus (due to the different distances being within the focused range from the lens)",t3_b9obbk,06-04-2019
53,28,ek8oy7s,t1_ek8or80,"sorry, should have been clearer: assuming the focal length would be adjusted for the same framing, basically.

54,28,ek8p5if,t1_ek8oy7s,"Yes, in the case where both cameras are set to equivalent framing, then the difference in brightness will be apparent. But in my case, I'm happy with the extra depth of field a mirrorless offers. As f/8 on a m43 sensor gives a depth of field equivalent to f/16 on a full frame one. Please do correct me if I have my concepts wrong. I'm just someone who does photography as a hobby and I do like to read some articles and blogs to educate myself. And sometimes I do understand things wrongly or miss out on important points.

173,28,ebo7r6j,t1_ebnznsr,"Taken from another post down the reddit thread: 

The purpose of an Instrument landing system is that it allows a pilot or an aircraft's Autoland system to fly an approach to the runway with the assistance of a set of radio signal emitted from a directional antenna called a localiser. The purpose of an ILS is that it allows an aircraft to fly a guided approach, in both the vertical and horizontal axes in reduced visibility until they are close to the runway.
"" “But that’s not how ILS works. ILS is like an auto-pilot in an aircraft, it's a tool for the pilot. The pilot can always have a manual intervention if security concerns require it,” Mr Khaw said. “So, auto-pilot doesn’t mean the pilot doesn’t have control. The pilot retains full control throughout the flight.” ""
This is simply wrong. In bad weather, a pilot will be flying guided by instruments which are in turn guided by the localiser signal. The point of ILS is to allow a safe approach even if he cannot see outside the aircraft. The idea that a pilot should be expected to manually intervene to obstacles he probably would not see is in fundamentally in opposition to how a safe ILS works. KBW thus provides and excellent example of why people should never mistake a scholarly demeanor for a person being right.
So maybe we can shift the ILS approach to accommodate Pasir Gudang? This would be difficult.
Typical airliner short final approaches are 7km in length at minimum long final is 15 km. So at absolute minimum, the aircraft must be lined up with the axis of the runway from 15 km out. This inevitably puts you well over Malaysia from Seletar.
An ILS approach has an angle of descent is typically 3 degrees or so. Approaches that significantly exceed this will require specialised aircraft and aircrews to fly. For instance, London City Airport has an approach of 5.5 degrees but only specially rated pilots and aircraft can fly this approach. This is the steepest instrument approach in the world.
It is from this approach angle that height buffers are derived. Furthermore, you are correct when you say that the approach will need to be clear of radar reflective objects ( like Pasir Gudang's Quay cranes) that can disrupt the glide slope localiser signal. Assuming the Malaysians have done their math correctly, I don't really see any factual problem with their assessment. There are likely going to be some unhappy restrictions on what they can build in Pasir Gudang.
I hope this matter can be resolved, but a fact based understanding of the engineering constraints is necessary.

And... 

Well put. As a bizjet pilot who flies into Seletar occasionally, we are already flying through MY airspace as we shoot the visual approach to runway 21 at WSSL (the reciprocal end as well). Looking at the Jeppesen chart, the FIR of both countries basically cut through the Straits so if MY gets their way to control that airspace, unless MY ATC releases us early, it is both impractical and unsafe to switch from MY to SG control at the FIR boundary on short final. I don’t think there is any airport in the world where a foreign country’s controller handover to another at short final. Even an offset ILS procedure wouldn’t work to avoid MY airspace unless it’s used to avoid height restrictions for a straight-in ILS approach over Pasir Gudang.
As I see it, the issue of ILS is just a red herring as whether ILS or not, all departing and arriving aircrafts will enter MY airspace.",t3_a5ifvr,13-12-2018

> Life of the junglefowls and chickens living in the Sin Ming estate in the Thomson area has been a roller coaster ride.

> Sin Ming's chickens

> In 2017, 21 pieces of feedback from residents in three years led to the decision to cull 24 free-roaming chickens in Sin Ming estate.

> What appeared as a knee-jerk reaction to get rid of the chickens then led to a huge national discussion over the then-Agri-food and Veterinary Authority's (AVA) decision to put down the birds.

> Here's a recap of the tail-end of what happened three years ago:

> Poll showed residents okay with chickens

> Following that, a poll was conducted by the Thomson Sin Ming Court residents' committee (RC) in May 2019 to seek residents' views on whether to leave the chickens alone or to relocate them.

> More than 1,000 residents cast their votes and in the end, over 90 per cent of the residents who voted chose to leave the chickens alone, The Straits Times reported.

> Yes, that was a clear mandate to leave the chickens alone.

> Sadly, the chickens in Sin Ming still face the possibility of relocation despite the poll conducted last year.

> Residents' feedback about noise and overpopulation

> One resident, Jun Chong, received a flyer on Oct. 7 informing residents that there has been feedback claiming that the population of the free-roaming chickens within Thomson Sin Ming Court estate has shot up.

> Adding on to that, there were complaints about the noise from the chickens as they disturb those working from home during this pandemic period.

> Therefore, some chickens will be relocated to a Seletar farm where they will be kept as pets, the flyer said.

> A quick check on Google Maps shows that the Seletar farm is called The Animal Resorts.

> The flyer did not state how many chickens will be relocated and whether the native and rare junglefowls will be spared from this move.

> There was also no mention of how did the residents' committee come to this conclusion that the population of free-roaming chickens had gone out of control.

> Here's the flyer:

> Jun Chong, who is a filmmaker who made a film about the chickens in the estate, told Mothership that he observed that two hens had produced about six chicks each recently.

> However, not all chicks will grow up to maturity, he added.

> Unique bond between Sin Ming residents and chickens

> Earlier this year in January 2020, there were about 20 chickens observed in the Sin Ming Court area.

> Many residents have grown attached to these chickens, with some even participating in a short film inspired by the relationship between Sin Ming residents and the chickens.

> Those residents who are attached to the chickens are concerned about the safety of these animals.

> Jun Chong recalled encountering some middle-aged men and women in the neighbourhood who were very protective of the chickens:

> ""I actually spent more time trying to talk to the residents and coax the residents, more than directing the film itself. Because whenever I was directing and they see the chickens, they would be like, 'Oh my God what are you doing?? Are you catching the chickens?? Are you going to do something to the chickens??' So they were very worried and I would say, 'No, it’s a response to that incident and I’m just paying my tribute as a filmmaker to do that'. And so they’ll like, 'Ohh okay,' then they would feel at ease.""

> Mothership has reached out to Bishan CC, MP Chong Kee Hiong, and NParks for comment.

> Totally unrelated but follow and listen to our podcast here

> 

> He did not fulfill the Health Ministry’s (MOH) criteria for a suspected case of the coronavirus and as such was not sent to the hospital using a dedicated ambulance service, the circular said.

> MOH then brought the case to Phoenix Medical’s attention on Thursday at around midday for active contact tracing, it added, noting the group was informed that his infection was confirmed later that night.

> On Wednesday at about 11pm, test results confirmed the man was infected by the coronavirus.

> “Epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are ongoing to identify individuals who had close contact with the case, and to establish any link he may have had with confirmed cases in Singapore or travellers from mainland China,” MOH said in its statement.

> 

> “We are interviewing the patient and his close contacts, and investigating the locations he had recently been to,” it added.

> 

> In the Phoenix Medical Group’s circular – signed by three of the clinic’s doctors – it said all the rooms, corridors, table tops, seats and examination couches had been ""deep cleansed"" between 6pm and 9pm on Thursday.

> The doctor who attended to the man had also opted to take a voluntary leave of absence until Feb 17, and is currently well, it noted.

> 

> “We would like to assure members of the public, patients and well-meaning family and friends that we will remain vigilant against the scourge of the novel coronavirus and continue our fight against it,” Phoenix Medical said in the circular.

> In 2014, hailstones were reportedly seen in Turf Club Road during a heavy downpour. In 2013, a rare hailstorm uprooted trees and disrupted traffic.

> The last reported incidence of hail before this was in 2008.

> According to the National Environment Agency&apos;s (NEA&apos;s) website, hail is produced only by cumulonimbus or thunderstorm clouds.

> The stones consist mostly of ice, measuring between 5mm and 50mm in diameter, with larger stones occurring in severe thunderstorms.

> Hail forms in strong thunderstorm clouds with intense updrafts and where a good portion of the cloud layer is below 0 deg C.

> Hail is less common in the tropics despite a higher frequency of thunderstorms because the atmosphere over the tropics tends to be warmer over a much greater depth.

> It is more frequently seen along mountain ranges, as mountains force horizontal winds upwards, intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely.

> ST has contacted NEA for more information.

From what I found, it seems Pulau Ubin (and other surrounding islands) were ceded to the East India company as part of the [1824 Treaty of Friendship and Alliance](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2015-07-23_153326.html).

>Under the terms of the 1824 treaty, Singapore and its surrounding islands were ceded to the EIC.

In the article about [Pulau Ubin](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_219_2004-12-13.html), it is mentioned

>In 1825, exactly one year after Singapore was ceded to the British, John Crawfurd,  the Resident, made an expedition around Pulau Ubin, or Pulo Obin as it  was spelt then, to take formal possession of it. Crawfurd’s party landed  on the island on 4 August 1825, hoisted the British flag and fired a  21-gun salute. The island’s occupants then were a few woodcutters living  in huts.

Additionally from  [John Crawfurd](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_188_2005-01-20.html)

>The treaty ceded to the EIC all rights to Singapore and the islands within 10 geographical miles of its shores.

Seems like the territories comprising ""Singapore"" were decided by the British at that time. Successive administrations, whether in Malaysia/Singapore, may have just followed the existing definitions.

> SINGAPORE — A 20-year-old man was charged in court on Tuesday (Aug 6) for flying a drone recreationally without a valid permit.

> Court documents showed that Homen Wong allegedly flew the drone in the afternoon of Feb 8 last year, at the open field next to Sengkang LRT Station.

> The field is situated within five kilometres of two aerodromes — Seletar Airport and Paya Lebar Air Base. 

> Wong is accused of operating a 0.74kg DJI Mavic Pro unmanned aircraft without a Class 2 activity permit.

> Wong told the court that he intends to plead guilty to the charge, and he will return to court on Sept 3.

> If convicted under the Air Navigation Order, he could be fined up to S$20,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to 15 months, or fined up to S$40,000, or both.

> Last month, two men became the first individuals prosecuted here for flying drones without a permit near an airbase.

> Ed Chen Junyuan, 37, and Tay Miow Seng, 40, were charged in court on July 5 for allegedly flying drones recreationally at an open field in Punggol, which is within 5km of the Paya Lebar Air Base. Their case is still pending.

> So far, only a construction firm has been dealt with in court for a similar offence.

> The Singapore arm of LT Sambo, a civil engineering company that primarily deals with bridge, tunnel, viaduct and elevated highway construction, was fined S$9,000 last month for flying a DJI Phantom drone along Marine Parade Road in 2017 for business purposes without a permit.

> The company had been carrying out underground foundation works for an MRT development project, and wanted to capture aerial footage of the vicinity for its construction work plan.

This creates a few problems. 

If the Seletar line serves the existing far flung areas of Yishun, Simpang will be neglected in the future. The northern region with the NSL, the TEL, and the Seletar line would be quite saturated, meaning there won’t be a JRL-like system serving Simpang like JRL is to Tengah. An LRT system to be added on later for Simpang would also not be feasible if the Seletar line stations are built in Yishun.

If the Seletar line is routed to pass through the coast for Simpang, Yishun will be ignored once again and it will not help in relieving the congested NSL. Express buses on the NSC is too limited to replace MRTs, no matter how some want to believe so (to make it significant, you need 5 DDs every 3-5 mins which is quite unfeasible).

Perhaps if the CRL’s Punggol branch is extended to Yishun and split off as a North Coast line, in addition to the Seletar line, it might fulfil both the needs of present day Yishun and the future Simpang.

I’m still guessing LTA will be ignoring Yishun once again. Some of the transport improvements in Yishun was done only after it was pushed for by the former MP Er Dr Lee, and now she’s retired, I’m not sure if there’s anyone left to push for anything for Yishun. I doubt the guy in charge of the easternmost area of Yishun (and one of the worst in terms of transport) would be as eager to push for improvements, even though he did promised so.

Another issue I see with the current arrangement is that it would be troublesome to change lines since they are parallel.

Taking a bus is probably not much faster either given the longer waiting times.

If it so happens that Simpang town is on the table again, then maybe one solution could be to extend the Punggol branch like you mentioned, with the Seletar line routing further out instead.

Assuming that the future Seletar Line and Simpang station hugs the coast (nearer to Seletar Island) to serve the future residents there, Yishun residents along the Ave 6/8 (particularly those on the eastern side nearer to the dam) will still find last-mile connectivity to be a hassle.",t3_hwazz9,23-07-2020
390,28,fyys591,t1_fyypouk,"Yishun is a very populated town that has grown massively in the past 10 years. The public transport infrastructure, on the other hand, isn’t catching up. 

The upcoming TEL only indirectly relieve the crowd on the NSL, provided people upstream in Woodlands and Admiralty switches to it. With Canberra being developed, I don’t think the load on the NSL upstream will lower by much. 

This is the problem. Yishun is entirely reliant on the NSL. There is *no* alternative MRT lines, and poor bus routes that only a handful go anywhere useful. 

Building Seletar line in Simpang’s future central area means that it is not located near Yishun itself. This is a possibility, since the line was originally meant to support Simpang, not Yishun. Unless there are *many* routes going into the residential areas of Yishun, it is unlikely for it to be convenient enough for Yishun residents to utilise. Most outward bound trunk routes of Simpang will not be routed through Yishun, as it’s more likely to take advantage of Seletar Link instead. Any trunk route bound for the northern towns will likely avoid the core residential areas of Yishun, since Yishun has a special ring-like layout.

The Seletar line is also meant to help with the transport in the coastal areas of the north (the existing industrial and colonial bungalows area), which means the existing crowd relying on NSL would still rely on the NSL.

There is a reason I suggested the CRL branch line.

The CRL Punggol line was once speculated to form the basis of the hypothetical “North Coast Line”. It’s supposed to link the north (Woodlands/Sembawang) to the northeast/east when the demand is there. 

Given that OP suggested for the Seletar line to terminate in Woodlands, it would make sense for the Seletar line to serve future Simpang developments instead, and have the other terminate with the NSL early (which in this case would be the North Coast line branch of the CRL). This creates an alternative to the NSL for Yishun while simultaneously improving connections to the East (connecting Yishun to the Seletar line *and* the east).

Terminating the hypothetical North Coast Line on the Seletar Line is self-defeating. People from Woodlands would have to transfer to TEL, then Seletar Line, then to the North Coast Line. For those in the southern parts of Sembawang, it would be more ridiculous (NSL to Woodlands, then TEL, then Seletar Line, finally before transferring to the North Coast Line). Since the Seletar line is already serving Northern Sembawang/Senoko and Simpang, it makes it less advantageous to duplicate it and terminate at Sembawang.

Logically, a connection to the NSL at Yishun would be more advantageous (also convenient for residents in other northern towns to transfer to). 

Furthermore, Yishun is a *very populated town* and as of 2018, it comes 7th in terms of population and it is one of the 7 towns with more than 220,000 people! Other towns below it were all below a population of 200,000. More developments are on plan to increase the population even more, with the entire area around the former Bottle Tree Park to be demolished for HDBs, and continued packing of Yishun East with residential developments. These will put a lot of strain on the only MRT line in Yishun, making it even more imperative to improve its rail connections!

Every other town with population that large (> 200,000) is well served with multiple MRT lines: Bedok (EWL, DTL, TEL), Jurong West (EWL, JRL), Tampines (EWL, DTL), Woodlands (NSL, TEL, Seletar Line), Sengkang (NEL, Seletar Line?), and Hougang (NEL, CRL, Seletar Line?).",t3_hwazz9,23-07-2020

Let’s not kid ourself. The furthest BTOs in Yishun doesn’t even have a feeder route to Yishun or Khatib for a year since they moved in, let alone *feeder routes* going from Yishun to Springleaf! You know how long it took for them to finally connect parts of Yishun to Khatib? It took Lee Bee Wah years and years of lobbying just for service 860/807 to be created, connecting Yishun Park/Chong Pang to Khatib. 

It took them so long to even create new feeder bus connections to alternative NSL stations to relieve the crowding at Yishun MRT, I am totally not optimistic about bus improvements and connections.

Even if there’s a trunk bus route from Yishun south to Springleaf, the capacity diverted from the NSL is insignificant. What is 1 DD every 5 mins (which is unlikely for a trunk route) compared to a MRT line? A NSEWL train carries 1,700 passengers, a DD carries only 135 at most.

Secondly, the Seletar line is not for you. I would go as far as to say that it's meant to handle the load that is Sengkang and Punggol - NEL is at or potentially beyond capacity, and this isn't something ""Jamus oppa"" can wish away. It wouldn't be far fetched to say that capacity on that line should be kept for Sengkang and Punggol - and thus, Yishun residents should be discouraged from routing there unless the usual route is obstructed by a breakdown.

Thirdly, putting the above two in perspective, I would be well placed to further extend this rail line to Springleaf at least in order to ""avoid congestion at Yishun Central"". But after I take out three quarters of Woodlands, do I still need that?

Feeder buses to Springleaf was an alternative I put across, but looking at it the best it can do is for the Bottle Tree Park BTOs, which is still an improvement to the Yishun Central situation.

The last mistake you make is assuming that the need to develop Simpang will happen before 2040. The way out for the government's issues with HDB leases expiring will be simply to take back old land for redevelopment first, which means densification and packing more people into the space we already have. You can already see this happen in Queenstown for one, which is why I'd really be more concerned about that area.

Personally, I think MND (who call the shots here) don't really know what they want to do with Simpang yet, so it could happen that the North Coast section of the Seletar line is the last to be built.

So let me get this straight. If we built an MRT, people will not use it as a means to transfer to another alternative line (Seletar line) 5 mins away. But if we set up a slower bus route thats 20-30 mins away, people somehow magically want to transfer to the TEL? Is that even logical?

I know that. Seletar Line alone is meant to support the Northeast and improve connectivity at the northern coast. That’s why I suggested to OP to route Seletar Line out of Yishun and skip it entirely. Weren’t you paying attention? That being said, there is no reason why future lines cannot be build to synergise with it. If you are a urban planner, you seem to be one that’s quite fixated.

Speaking of BTOs, you want to know the true meaning of suffering? The folks collecting their BTOs in Tengah who move right next to an MRT construction site - which they can only use in 2027.

When those at Tengah brought it, they are counting on the future excellent public transport. It’s not as if I don’t have friends or colleagues who brought a flat there. Today it may be long, but tomorrow it won’t be. Everyone knows that MRT lines dont appear overnight. For those at the Yishun BTOs, travelling 20-30 mins to get to Yishun MRT *alone* is ridiculous. Making it even more ridiculous is there isn’t anything planned to alleviate that shitty commute like those in Tengah.

Comparing one with a solid laid out future improvement with one with absolutely nothing... hardly comparable.

Oh I’m sure. Daddy knows best what do we know? Our lives sucks? Then suck it cos daddy knows best. You don’t know how good your life is? See those kids in Africa?

Cut me this nonsense. Other threads about Seletar line also have comments on Yishun being left out. It’s not as if I’m the only one who sees it. If you don’t live there and experience it, how can you understand it? It’s like someone telling a *minority* to check their privilege after pointing out some superficial things you did for them. 

What happen to having the majority of households within walkable distance of MRT? Rich people in Bukit Timah and East Coast deserves good MRT but peasants in BTO shouldn’t? For peasants, the MRT is even more critical compared to all those people living in landed. They can take their cars if they don’t like it. We have to suck it even if it takes more than 1 hour per trip to get to work or whatever.

Nobody is robbing anything. I did not ask for them to make drastic routing that lopsidedly favours Yishun. I’m merely suggested that Seletar line just follow the original suggested LRT for the north coast, as stated in the 1996 white paper, to support future developments at Simpang and at the northern industrial areas. 

As the original 1996 white paper also suggested an interchange with the NSL at Sembawang, why is there a problem terminating the future hypothetical North Coast Line at Yishun? Eventually there will be a line linking the north to the northeast if Punggol is to be developed to more than just a housing estate! If there’s a Seletar Line serving the north coast, why the fuck are we duplicating it for? Who am I stealing it from to have the North Coast Line connect to the NSL early at Yishun? Sembawang? Come on Sembawang has a fraction of the population and the northern parts would be served by the Seletar Line. Why are we duplicating it?

My suggestions are logical if you read the original one and not get distracted and lost yourself. The northern section of the Seletar Line was part of the former North Coast Line in the 1996 white paper. And since connectivity problem between the north and northeast is a perennial problem, it is logical that one day there *will be* a new line doing exactly what North Coast Line was meant to do. When that day come, the northern section will have to come up with a new alignment so as to not duplicate with Seletar Line or fall far short of its purpose by not linking up with the NSL.

Tell that to the people willing to take a long detour on 979 and 983 when they have the NSL so nearby. If I can redirect 5% of people to the TEL, because it fits their journeys better, it would still be an improvement.

For what it is worth, bus lanes or even proper BRT along Ave 1 to Khatib would be the best solution in the interim. Or you know what? Resurrect the Yishun LRT proposals and use trams/streetcars, that's an option too.

Explain to me why they should spend hundreds of millions to clear the forest and build ghost stations that may possibly never see the light of day, and which may potentially be in the way of whatever master plan URA cooks up? We're talking about a stretch of line that's about 3.5km long and will see at least two stations. Plus, given the geography of Simpang now, you can't even build the line without talking about significant amounts of land reclamation, which means that it'll have to wait. For what it's worth, CP2011 has downgraded Simpang to a reserve site.

If there's a need to build that line so urgently they might as well route the line along Yishun Ave 8, with a station to serve those Yishun East BTOs. Which is, for the record, what OP has done.

>	Noble, but the point remains that you shouldn't be using that route most of the time. There are synergies as mentioned above, but in this case, I'd prefer not to have them.

Your point is that you do not want to see any MRT line in the north channeling passengers to the Seletar Line. Fine, if they want to tunnel extra tunnels with millions more in cost to reach Springleaf from Yishun so that people would be diverted to TEL, go ahead. The hilly terrain around that area means that it’s not so good for elevated tracks. 

Since Seletar Line isn’t concretely planned out, there’s no reason why they couldn’t increase the capacity to accomodate people from the North, in addition to Punggol-Sengkang, as compared to costly tunneling and extensions that’s at least 4km long (equivalent to the straight-line distance from Punggol to Hougang).

If I recall correctly, the announcement of feasibility studies for Seletar Line made it clear that it will take into consideration of future developments. The delay in having a northern line announced has been attributed by some to be a result of lack of clear idea on what to do with Simpang.

If that’s the case, those two agencies are probably discussing with one another on this matter.

In the long run, Simpang might need to be developed for whatever reason. You don’t want to end up with a situation that is difficult to rectify later. Building it near Yishun will neglect Simpang. That’s why LTA keeps building shell stations, such as the one at Bukit Brown. Reserve it now, plan later.

>	What purpose? Did I miss it? Given what I said, have you considered that we can simply not bring the Seletar line past Seletar, and simply have the CRL Punggol branch take up the Seletar-Sembawang-Woodlands portion?

Ummm... did I not made it clear many times? The purpose is to link the north to the northeast and east. Link Woodlands/Sembawang/Yishun to Punggol and Changi.

Punggol is meant to be another significant area for employment, with the Punggol digital district. Changi airport is a logistical hub which will employ many people. Right now, getting to the east from Yishun central could take 1 hour or more by bus, depending on road conditions. So near yet so far. The alternative is to crowd on the NSL in order to go southwards and transfer to two more lines.

With significant developments in the east, the need to connect the north to the east is ever more important. This has been an issue raised time and time again. Lee Bee Wah had complained for years that 969/858 alone isn’t sufficient.

Routing the North Coast line to hug the coast instead makes it difficult for people on the south/west of the NSL tracks to transfer (NSL -> TEL -> North Coast Line). The feeder buses from Sembawang to Senoko is packed enough, no need for more people to crowd there just to get to the MRT to go eastwards. Connecting this vital connection to the NSL directly is the best, preferably without any massive detour around Senoko! This is why I said in my original post that terminating the North Coast line on the Seletar line is self-defeating! It’s meant to improve and provide quick connections from the north to the east, but it ends up not doing so by getting itself distracted.

I have no idea why you are so repulsed to the idea that northerners need to share that Seletar line of yours. If capacity is a concern, then make it a 6-car line! What is the problem?

> SINGAPORE: Singapore has withdrawn the Instrument Landing System (ILS) procedures for Seletar Airport while Malaysia has indefinitely suspended its permanent restricted area over Pasir Gudang, both countries said on Saturday (Apr 6).

> Singapore’s Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan and his Malaysian counterpart Anthony Loke said in a joint statement that the agreement was made “in the spirit of bilateral cooperation”.

> Advertisement

> The agreement was implemented by the civil aviation authorities of both countries on Friday, the ministers said.

> “With this agreement, the Transport Ministers look forward to FlyFirefly Sdn Bhd’s commencement of flights to Seletar Airport effective April 2019,” they added.

> Malaysian budget airline Firefly suspended its flights to Singapore in December last year, after it was unable to obtain approval from Malaysia’s aviation regulator to move its operations from Changi Airport to Seletar Airport.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Changi Airport Group had earlier announced the move of turbo-prop operations to Seletar in a bid to optimise the use of resources at Changi.

> Singapore provides air traffic services over parts of southern peninsular Malaysia that is within the Kuala Lumpur Flight Information Region. This was an arrangement approved by the International Civil Aviation Organization in 1973.

> 

> In December, Malaysia said it wants to reclaim its ""delegated airspace"" in southern Johor, citing concerns over sovereignty and national interest.

> It also raised concerns about the ILS procedures for Singapore's Seletar Airport, saying that the flight path will impact developments and shipping operations at Johor's Pasir Gudang.

> Singapore, in response, said that the ILS simply puts on paper the existing flight paths, making safety rules clearer and more transparent.

> The statement by the transport ministers on Saturday said that a “high-level committee” has been set up to review the Operational Letter of Agreement between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore Area Control Centres Concerning Singapore Arrivals, Departures and Overflights 1974.

> “Both Transport Ministers welcome these positive steps and look forward to further strengthening bilateral cooperation,” it added.

> The animal feeding farm put up a Facebook post on Dec. 2, 2020 informing the public about its impending closure in about one month's time.

> Its last day of operations is on Jan. 10, 2021.

> Reason for closure

> The post claimed that the farm is unable to renew its lease as it cannot commit some S$250,000 into maintaining the premises, with no possibility for further extension of the lease of the land it is operating on after the two-year tenure is up.

> However, it did not specify the standards that it needed to maintain or meet in order to operate.

> The farm said half of its premises will be making way for new roads, while other farms in the vicinity are not affected.

> The Animal Resort also claimed that the authorities do not have other spaces for the farm to relocate to, and the existing animals will all be rehomed.

> Farm popular with families

> Located at a rustic part of Singapore, the family-friendly farm has free-roaming animals such as ducks, peacocks and cassowaries that interact with visitors.

> It also has a stable and horses.

> Members of the public can feed and pet the animals in the farm.

> We deliver more stories to you on LinkedIn

Seletar Airport (IATA: XSP, ICAO: WSSL) is a civilian airport located at Seletar, in the northeastern region of Singapore, and is managed by the Changi Airport Group. Originally, the airport was completed in 1928 as a flying Royal Air Force station (RAF Seletar) and was also Singapore's first international airport. It is approximately 16 kilometres away from Singapore Changi Airport and about 20 kilometres away from the city-centre.

There had been a proposal to extend its runway to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft), so as to be able to receive the Boeing 737 used by many budget airlines.

***

**Instrument landing system**

An Instrument Landing System (ILS) enables pilots to conduct an instrument approach to landing if they are unable to establish visual contact with the runway.

It is defined by the International Telecommunication Union as a service provided by a station as follows:



A radionavigation system which provides aircraft with horizontal and vertical guidance just before and during landing and, at certain fixed points, indicates the distance to the reference point of landing.

For now, the only verified recent records are mostly from the Sungei Buloh, Kranji, and Lim Chu Kang areas, with sightings of possibly transient individuals in Sembawang, Pasir Ris, Changi, and East Coast Park. I expect there will be more sightings in other coastal areas of Singapore, especially with dispersal of juveniles and displacement of crocodile populations as mangroves and other coastal habitats in Johor continue to be lost.

I won't completely discount the possibility of crocodiles being present in Lower Seletar, especially since it's near the coast, and it's easy for a crocodile to swim across from Johor and cross over the dam into the reservoir. We need evidence like a clear photo or video of one in the reservoir, ideally with landmarks in the background; there have been idiots circulating videos of crocodiles and claiming that they were recorded in Singapore, but some of these turn out to have been filmed in other countries.

> PUTRAJAYA - Singapore and Malaysia are working towards a supplementary agreement to suspend a cross-border rail link between Woodlands and Johor Baru.

> Singapore's Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said on Monday (April 8) that the attorneys-general and officials from both countries are working on an agreement to effect a suspension of the Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link.

> Speaking at a press conference alongside his Malaysian counterpart Anthony Loke at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Mr Khaw noted that Malaysia has requested a six-month suspension of the RTS Link so it can review key parameters of the project.

> ""We will approach this issue as we did for the suspension of the HSR project, with goodwill and reasonable accommodation,"" he said.

> Singapore and Malaysia had earlier agreed to a two-year suspension of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) project, with Malaysia paying Singapore $15 million for abortive costs incurred due to the suspension.

> Asked whether there would be any cost involved in suspending the RTS, Mr Loke said there will be costs involved, but this has to be determined by a review.

> Mr Khaw also said that the civil aviation authorities of both countries will work together to develop GPS-based instrument approach procedures for Seletar Airport.

> This is in place of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) procedures that Singapore has withdrawn, he added.

> ""We will introduce GPS-based instrument approaches from both the north over Pasir Gudang and south over Singapore island. This is because airplanes take off and land into the wind. With north-east and south-west wind directions at different times of the year, both approaches are needed,"" Mr Khaw said.

> He added that the procedures are expected to be published soon, and will improve safety for flights using Seletar Airport.

> The press conference by the ministers came after Singapore and Malaysia reached an agreement on recent air issues last week.

> Mr Khaw and Mr Loke had said in a joint statement on Saturday (April 6) that ""in the spirit of bilateral cooperation"", Singapore will withdraw the ILS procedures for Seletar Airport, while Malaysia will indefinitely suspend its permanent restricted area over Pasir Gudang.

> The agreement, implemented by the civil aviation authorities of both countries last Friday, paves the way for Malaysian carrier Firefly to begin flying into Seletar on April 21, more than four months after its flights were suspended.

> 

> Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan (centre right) meeting his Malaysian counterpart Anthony Loke (centre left) with officials at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on April 8, 2019. ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI

> 

> On Monday, Mr Khaw said that both ministries have reached a ""win-win outcome"" after several rounds of discussions to understand each other's concerns and needs.

> He also noted that a high-level committee has been set up to review the existing airspace arrangement in which Singapore air traffic controllers manage airspace over southern Johor.

> It will be co-chaired by Singapore's permanent secretary for transport and Malaysia's secretary-general of transport.

> Malaysia has said it wants to retake control of the airspace over southern Johor.

> ""I had explained to Minister Loke that the current arrangement was brokered by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) at a 1973 Regional Air Navigation Meeting. It was agreed upon by states in the region, and approved by the ICAO Council,"" Mr Khaw said on Monday.

> Related Story Singapore, Malaysia suspend implementation of overlapping port limits

> Related Story ILS - helping pilots to land safely even in bad weather

> Related Story Issues of sovereignty and competing boundary claims

> ""Minister Loke stressed that the review was important to Malaysia. I assured him that Singapore would approach the review with an open mind, bearing in mind the many stakeholders involved and the critical need to ensure safety and efficiency in a very busy airspace,"" he added.

> ""With goodwill and compromise, I am sure that a win-win solution which does not undermine each other's core interests can be found.""

> The dispute over Seletar surfaced in November 2018, when Firefly announced that it would not move from Changi Airport to the new Seletar Airport passenger terminal on Dec 1 - as it had earlier agreed to.

> The Malaysian civil aviation regulator had objected to the move because of the introduction of an ILS at Seletar Airport, which it claimed would restrict developments at Pasir Gudang town nearby.

> Countering Malaysia's objections, Singapore said repeatedly that the use of an ILS at Seletar Airport does not change existing height limits.

> Following the disagreement over flight procedures for Seletar Airport, Malaysia declared a restricted zone over Pasir Gudang for the purpose of military activities.

> This affected the flight path for aircraft heading to and from Seletar Airport, adding time and complexity.

> On Jan 8, both countries agreed to simultaneously and immediately suspend for one month the restricted area at Pasir Gudang and the ILS for Seletar.

> Singapore and Malaysia later agreed to mutually continue with the suspension till the end of March while the issues were discussed.
