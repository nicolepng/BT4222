But coming to your comment itself... what is the probability of a toilet cleaner becoming a rocket scientist in few years (in general, I’m sure there could be exceptions). The reason SG needs immigrant workers is because 99% of them have families in their native countries and not in Singapore, due to which the little pay they get suffices to send money back to their families who can live off decently on that monies given the lower cost of living at their native place. So a cleaner job for a local Singaporean, will not be able to support the cost of living and supporting a family, kids higher education and others. The government wants to build a highly skilled workforce which will reduce dependence on expats in the longer run, and that cannot be achieved by making low skilled jobs attractive for local population. Not just SG but a lot of developed economies want their local population to focus on high skilled jobs, while providing low cost infra services support through immigrants. 

Now, coming to unemployment, it is not as if there is shortage of jobs in Singapore. A larger issue is that of all the people that graduate every year, how many of them are actually employable. Private companies pay expats a higher amount than they would end up paying for local talent, but the issue is the dearth of talent because of which they go for expats. And a trend where more and more local populace will actually shift moving towards doing low skilled jobs rather than trying to make themselves more employable for high skills jobs, you are moving from a developed to a developing economy.",t3_lnflsb,20-02-2021

And you and I will fly on this tangent from here until eternity because neither of us will back down. I like this sub's (r/AskScienceDiscussion) sub titles: Discuss, learn, teach. Follow the tangents. Let's ride.

> tuition and debt

There are 24 hours a day, of which we demand that they spend 8 to work at a job. Of the remaining 8 (8 is for sleep), they need to spend on commute, eating, relieving themselves, and somehow up skill themselves and raise a family (isn't that what's the problem of low TFR is? Forget the employability of locals, with low TFRs, there will be no locals to speak of). Well, some of those has to go. People cut down on sleep and healthy lifestyles, so they can work more, up skill more, or raise a family, at the cost of an early death, depression, psychological problems like burnout, exhaustion, depression, etc ... 

Alternatively, they cut out the ""raising a family"" part. They don't bother with getting to know somehow, marrying, or having children. All in the sacrifice of jobs, skills, money, up this or that.

Yes, people can probably learn one thing or another to continuously improve their skills and keep up with the general advances; for example, doctors get their ""Continuous medical education"" credit on the hospital clocks.

In short, you can't really expect people to work 8 hours and then spend some time ""up skill-ing"" and do all the rest healthily. Tuition and debt add another pressure on people ditching some of the responsibilities to themselves or their family in chasing the mirage of jobs and skills. If the government is really serious about providing greater skills; extensive supports are required.

> for roles within strategy and management perspective, there is a lot of scope for improvement

There is some studies or other that says ""entrepreneurs have higher risk-taking appetites"". There is a simpler explanation: they are rich kids with cushy safety nets. I could have and raise a family while accepting a 50% pay cut for 4 years to ""up skill"" by getting a PhD not because I am good at taking calculated risks. I could do it because I have rather well-off parents.",t3_lnflsb,22-02-2021

329,12,dtnkovv,t1_dtnetgc,"Well, its common knowledge most Singaporean parents discipline their kids without wanting to understand why their kids did an 'undesirable' action in the first place. 

I believe most adults have lost touch with experiences of their earlier childhood that they fail to acknowledge children are capable of complex thinking and proper (but infantile) decision making. So they assume all children are simple minded beings incapable of making decisions for themselves.

This brings us to your comment.

Singaporean parents do understand the huge emotional and financial and physical 'investment' required to raise a child. Furthermore, such parents are stressed out from their jobs and it is also a widely known fact that Singaporeans are **a bunch of cynics**. 

This puts kids in a situation where they do not have any chance to give an in depth explaination of their actions and to also be taken seriously. Singaporean parents rather beat their child, take out their stress on them and also reinforce the idea that making them worry is bad and they should never do it again because a good kid doesnt worry his/parents.

It is the simplest and easiest catch-all method to the typical stressed out, cynical Singaporean parent and human beings favor the path of least resistance. If raising your kid doesnt go smoothly, most of the time you resort to beating him/her in order to smoothen things out because finding the root of the problem is harder than simply taking out your frustration on your child.

Get it? Ive experienced all this first hand and I sure wont want my future child to go through what Ive gone through.

TL;DR: Flustered, stressed out parents are more likely to beat a child because he/she went missing. Chances increase if he has a history of mischief or problems. Strong beliefs of sparing the rod will spoil the child are commonplace and it is easier to associate bad/unpredictable behaviour to pain rather than find the root of the problem and nip it in the bud.

People start replying to you, disagreeing with your statement. With almost 200 downvotes, you think to yourself, “wow so many stupid sheep in this subreddit, why can’t people understand someone as smart as me. I’m such a black sheep among white sheep. People hate me because I’m special.”

Why I did it? Its not because I have low IQ or EQ. Its called playing the Devil's Advocate.

Some kids are that cunning but im also not saying the autistic kid did that on purpose.

> SINGAPORE — The Indian worker who died in a crane collapse at a construction site in Novena was the sole breadwinner of his family.

> Mr Velmurugan Muthian, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene after a crane collapsed during a lifting operation at the construction site of a new rehab facility in Jalan Tan Tock Seng on Monday (Nov 4).

> A Bangladeshi worker was also taken to hospital with injuries.

> Mr Velmurugan's body is set to be flown back to India early on Thursday, accompanied by his cousin who is also a worker here, said Ms Dipa Swaminathan, founder of ItsRainingRaincoats, an initiative that gives help to migrant workers in Singapore.

> As he was a Hindu, his body is likely to be cremated sometime on Thursday, she added.

> Mr Velmurugan, who was from Tamil Nadu, was employed by LKT Contractors and had only been working in Singapore for about three months. 

> He previously worked here for more than five years, then returned to India to get married.

> 

> His wife, elderly parents and younger brother rely on his paycheck, and a few days before the accident, he received news that his wife was expecting their first child, said ItsRainingRaincoats.

> In a post on its Facebook page, the volunteer organisation shared a link to a crowdfunding campaign, which has raised more than S$122,000 as of 11am on Thursday. Two volunteers also gave white packets to Mr Velmurugan’s cousin, Ms Dipa said.

> The money will be sent to his family in India.

> “We will likely wait for his cousin to return from India and pass him the money in person so he can give it to the family,” Ms Dipa said.

> She said they want to make sure that the money is spent well and that it will go to the family.

> She told CNA that the crowdfunding campaign will likely remain up until Mr Velmurugan’s cousin returns to Singapore on Nov 14.

> Of the decision to put Mr Velmurugan’s details on the social media website, Ms Dipa said: “Our real goal, more than the money, was that we didn't want him to be another statistic. We wanted everyone to know his name and story.” CNA

* [Javan Myna](https://singaporebirds.com/species/javan-myna/)
* [Rock Pigeon](https://singaporebirds.com/species/rock-dove/)
* [House Crow](https://singaporebirds.com/species/house-crow/)

Among the many non-native parrot species recorded here as escapees or breeding in the wild, the [Red-breasted Lorikeet](https://singaporebirds.com/species/red-breasted-parakeet/) and [Rose-ringed Parakeet](https://singaporebirds.com/species/rose-ringed-parakeet/) are doing very well, and possibly compete with the native Long-tailed Parakeet. The [Coconut Lorikeet](https://singaporebirds.com/species/coconut-lorikeet/) has also been breeding in the wild, and there are recent nesting records of Monk Parakeets in the east side of Singapore.

Other non-native species may be found in wooded areas and parks all over Singapore, such as [Lineated Barbet](https://singaporebirds.com/species/lineated-barbet/), [Red-whiskered Bulbul](https://singaporebirds.com/species/red-whiskered-bulbul/), [Sooty-headed Bulbul](https://singaporebirds.com/species/sooty-headed-bulbul/), and [White-crested Laughingthrush](https://singaporebirds.com/species/white-crested-laughingthrush/). Other species may be found in grassland areas, such as [Red Collared Dove](https://singaporebirds.com/species/red-collared-dove/), [Javan Munia](https://singaporebirds.com/species/javan-munia/), and various species of African waxbills (e.g. Common Waxbill, Crimson-rumped Waxbill, Pin-tailed Whydah) and weavers (Golden-backed Weaver).

Even among our so-called native birds, a proportion of the local population has turned out to be of non-native origin. Species like Swinhoe's White-eye, Oriental Magpie-robin, and White-rumped Shama are very popular as songbirds, and genetic studies have confirmed that some apparently wild birds are escapees from the pet trade, or descendants of escapees.",t3_i1lv4z,01-08-2020

> [SINGAPORE] Singapore police are looking into a complaint from Ernst & Young that a firm owned by bidders for football club Newcastle United allegedly used the auditor's unauthorised signatures on financial statements.

> The investigation is the latest scrutiny of Singaporean business duo Terence and Nelson Loh since Reuters reported their other firm behind the Newcastle bid doctored photos of Barack Obama and made other suspect claims in marketing materials.

> The police report lodged this week relates to the financial statements of Cayman Islands incorporated Novena Global Healthcare Group, which is owned by the Loh cousins.

> A spokesperson for Ernst & Young said it was ""never the auditors"" of the Cayman Islands parent firm, and worked for a Singapore-based subsidiary only in 2017.

> Police said they had received the complaint and were looking into the matter.

> Neither of the Lohs - thrust into the spotlight last month as the co-founders of the newly formed Bellagraph Nova Group which claimed to be in advanced talks to buy one of England's most high-profile clubs - responded to a request for comment.

> A lawyer speaking on behalf of Terence Loh told The Straits Times that he was aware of the allegations but denied wrongdoing.

> After the Reuters report, various other inconsistencies surfaced in BN Group's claims made on its website, press releases and social media posts, which it said ""appears to be the result of the actions of certain errant individuals"".

> Meanwhile people and businesses linked to the group started to distance themselves, while Singapore's The Business Times newspaper reported some regional investors were trying to withdraw investments from the group's entities.

> Singapore's corporate regulator ACRA has also said it is taking enforcement action on two other companies linked to the Lohs for not filing annual returns.

Any change in the initial position/reading indicates movement.There are limits to how much movements are allowed and once these limits are breached, the affecting construction works will either stop or review the methodology to avoid further movements.

> SINGAPORE - A worker died after a construction crane collapsed at a worksite in Novena on Monday (Nov 4).

> Another injured worker was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).

> The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it received a call for help at a construction site in Jalan Tan Tock Seng at about 8.50am.

> ""A boom of a tower crane had collapsed at the construction site and a man was pronounced dead at the scene by an SCDF paramedic,"" the SCDF said.

> ""Another worker was taken to TTSH after the incident.""

> The police said that a 28-year-old worker was found lying motionless and subsequently pronounced dead, and a 35-year-old worker was conscious when he was taken to hospital.

> Workers at the site told The Straits Times that the dead man was an Indian national, and the injured worker, a Bangladeshi, was hurt on his leg.

> They said the crane was carrying around 300kg of scaffolding material when it collapsed on both men, who were on the ground.

> “For construction (crane), 300kg is considered very light,” said a worker who declined to be named, adding that the cranes can lift materials weighing tonnes.

> The Indian national was found to be unresponsive and the Bangladeshi suffered some “slight injury” to his leg.

> Both workers are understood to be employed by BHCC, a subcontractor for the project.

> A resident whose apartment faces the construction site said she heard a loud boom in the area at about 8.30am. The 33-year-old consultant, who wishes to be known as Ms Goh, said she saw a crane operator stuck on top of the partially collapsed crane at the construction site.

> A new 17-storey 500-bed rehabilitation complex, which is part of TTSH, is being built by the Ministry of Health (MOH) at the worksite. Construction started in March 2017 and is scheduled to be completed by 2022.

> 

> An eyewitness said she saw a crane operator stuck on top of the partially collapsed crane at the construction site, which is opposite her apartment. PHOTO: ST READER

> 

> Ms Goh said that she saw SCDF ambulances and personnel at the scene.

> Related Story Greater emphasis on workplace safety and health needed: Zaqy

> Related Story Workplace death, major injury numbers for all companies to be published online

> The worker stuck at the top of the broken crane was able to climb down from the crane after 20 minutes, she added.

> When contacted, Crane World Asia confirmed that its crane has collapsed at the worksite and that it is looking into the incident.

> A spokesman for main contractor Kajima said that cause of the collapse is under investigation and the project team is looking into helping the families of the workers and claiming insurance for them.

> The Straits Times has contacted the Ministry of Manpower and MOH for more information.

> The police are investigating the incident.

> The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) is looking into the registration of a firm linked to the Bellagraph Nova (BN) Group, which has come under increased scrutiny following news of its bid for English Premier League football club Newcastle United.

> Yesterday's statement came on the same day that Axington, a Catalist-listed company linked to the BN Group, requested before the stock market opened that trading in its shares be suspended.

> Acra was responding to queries from The Straits Times yesterday on some of the firm's 31 entities, such as Novena Global Lifecare, which could not be found in Acra records.

> Novena Global Lifecare, a medical healthcare and aesthetics group, has been noted in media reports.

> An Acra spokesman said: ""While companies could at times use a different name for branding purpose, they have to include the registered company name and registration number in all business correspondences to ensure the public know who they are doing business with.""

> Carrying on a business without registration is an offence punishable with a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.

> The BN Group was co-founded by cousins Nelson and Terence Loh and Chinese gem merchant Evangeline Shen. It hit the spotlight after it was called out for doctored images of the founders with former United States president Barack Obama. Other inconsistencies in publicity materials also surfaced.

> The Loh cousins are also controlling shareholders of Axington, while Ms Shen is its non-independent non-executive chairman.

> The firm had called for the voluntary suspension pending the release of an announcement ""in relation to strategic changes to be made in the business direction of the company"".

> Last week, Axington postponed an extraordinary general meeting where shareholders were due to vote on the firm's name change to NETX and a shift in its core business, among other things.

> Acra added that it will also take enforcement action against two companies linked to the Loh cousins for failing to file their annual returns.

> Related Story More distance themselves from Singapore's Loh cousins behind Newcastle bid after Obama photo controversy

> Related Story From Obama photos to Bulgari clinic: Claims by Bellagraph Nova Group under scrutiny

> Firms that file late must pay a penalty, while those that fail to file will be subject to enforcement actions, including prosecution.

> The offence carries a maximum fine of $5,000. Acra can seek higher fines for firms with multiple breaches.

733,12,f1hlvog,t1_f1h468y,"Honestly just head to the polyclinic for a simple ECG and Chest X-Ray. The most anyone will reasonably add on is probably a stress echo.  
No one is going to subject you to radiation unnecessarily.  


Also, you know your risk factors. Do something about them.  
How long do you think a clearance from Cardiology lasts anyway? Definitely not a lifetime, and far shorter if you continue your current lifestyle.",t3_d9geeo,26-09-2019
734,12,f1hndpd,t1_f1h3jwj,"why mount e though, just go for the normal poly and referrals to public hospitals, bet the equipment is newer in govt hospitals",t3_d9geeo,26-09-2019
735,12,f1h4bq7,t1_f1h49d3,Am 24 this year. I believe risk factors include smoking and also being overweight.,t3_d9geeo,26-09-2019
736,12,f1h53s6,t1_f1h4bq7,"Acute coronary syndrome risk is Low 

Use the PERC score to assess your risk for pulmonary embolism - Google it 

Check your bp for both arms, make sure they are not different less than 20 mm Hg systolic to rule out aortic dissection 

Get a CXR done in polyclinic  to rule out pneumothorax 
They will do ECG as well in polyclinic 

Saved you an expensive trip.",t3_d9geeo,26-09-2019
737,12,f1h58vy,t1_f1h53s6,Haha but actually everything is claimable so I really don't mind to just head down and get checked by professionals. But your response is really appreciated!!,t3_d9geeo,26-09-2019
738,12,f1in7bk,t1_f1h53s6,Telemedicine over reddit between 2 anonymous people. Interesting!,t3_d9geeo,26-09-2019
739,12,f1h5vic,t1_f1h58vy,"Other investigations will be too invasive 

Ctca will have too much radiation exposure 

Threadmill is useless

They are hardly likely to angiogram your heart vessels - 1% of death or triggering a heart Attack 

Even if it’s claimable, they aren’t gonna do anything more that will help. But it’s mount e, they might do unnecessary investigations to earn more",t3_d9geeo,26-09-2019
740,12,f1h6bww,t1_f1h58vy,"Furthermore, you might not be admitted to claim. You don’t need any other investigations besides tropt, ecg, cxr",t3_d9geeo,26-09-2019

745,12,f1h6vv1,t1_f1h6tn1,I'm just wondering what are some of the reasons I'm experiencing this kind of pain.,t3_d9geeo,26-09-2019
746,12,f1io51u,t1_f1h6vv1,"I would say it could be stress related. I had chest pain that was on/off for months. Had an ECG etc, labs, nothing came of it. Went away two days after my exams. I didn't feel like I was that stressed but then it came back during the next school year towards the last few months and went away same as last time. Just a couple days after my exams.",t3_d9geeo,26-09-2019

758,12,f1dipum,t1_f1didxj,Gov requires the trees to be replanted somehow (not same trees or same place). However landscaping usually turns out pretty good in the end. Will be a few years of construction until that comes.,t3_d8fgw9,25-09-2019
