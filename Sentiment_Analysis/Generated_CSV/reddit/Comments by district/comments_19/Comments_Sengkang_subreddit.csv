the main selling point for the leopard is its very customizable and due to that, long service life. good value for money.

Of course there is good criticism and shitty criticism. But its simply wrong to dismiss ALL criticism of the state as ""sensationalizes irrelevant topics"" or ""disinformation"". 

I find the ""stay his lane"" comment absolutely absurd. People should never be censored on political discourse just because they are not politicians. Politicians must never hold the monopoly on political views because policies affect every single person in this country. Criticism of the state is part of loving your country, and passive acquiescence is not.

I disagree with the majority of Alfiaan Saat's posts. But that doesnt mean I cannot agree with some of his views once in a blue moon. Afterall, its the content that decides whether it is shitty criticism or good criticism, not the simple fact that it is criticism, u gets?

You don't have to be. No matter how good a freelancer is, there is only so many jobs they can do at once and so many people they know. To start freelancing, you just have to reasonably good at whatever you want to freelance as, and know someone that needs to get something done that you can help with, then figuring out how much it is worth.

Make it known to your social circle you can do stuff. Do some stuff, make a website to show off the stuff + what you can do, then look for stuff on portals or continue mining leads and contacts.

The civil service does *a lot* of deliberations internally, but stupid shit like not sharing the deliberations with oppo MPs mean that they are repeatedly accused of being intransparent. Not upgrading HDBs is just petty.

At the very least, all I want is people who can simply *run* a political party running the country. Most oppo parties can't even stop their party members defecting left right centre.

2015 - pap 51% wp 48%

to answer your question directly:

1) probably because historically the numbers looked really good, or that it was just next door to aljunied/hougang
2) pap did redraw the boundaries. a part of sengkang west went under amk, a part went to punggol and the rest became the new grc.

Fwiw, I'm more supportive of correction orders than takedown orders. It's similar to the earlier policy of ""right of reply"" with foreign newspapers in Singapore -- you may circulate in Singapore, but in exchange the government reserves the right of (making an unabridged) reply.

Partially maybe, but if you look at what all the parties have been talking about most, people are more concerned about bread and butter issues. Covid is but one recent issue.

If people are unhappy with how PAP handled Covid, that mostly comes down to our long term treatment of migrant workers & state media censorship, not Covid per se. I personally feel these are 2 major issues but they're nothing new on our political landscape and most people don't care.

In sum, I don't think many pro-establishment people have been swayed by Covid in itself. SARS was also from China and was genuinely terrifying for Singapore.

In fact it will further raise cost of living to redistribute wealth to the lowest income in the society. There is trade off. If PAP had done this, people would criticize them for raising costs of living.

It's a little bit misleading to simply describe her ""influential by certain standard"" without emphasizing she is a lawmaker who was voted in to represent her constituents.

Her strong opinion in this case, was not an opinion that had no relevancy in Singapore. It was an opinion that some citizens share.

>And no, i dont think you are right to say people vote for her for certain things and just be blinded on other aspects. I find this rather erroneous, and being a irresponsible voter.

To imply that voters view on her was not *blinded on other aspects*, you're implying that the citizens who voted her in either was fully aware or unaware of her controversies.

I may agree there may be few who are completely oblivious of these controversies, but you're very naive to suggest all people voted in were completely unaware of these.

> Just because i agree on her baseless claims i can ignore the clear subversive ideology of marxism? By this logic i should vote in a neo nazi, because he agrees with me my NS commander should not abuse his powers?

Again, it's very injudicious to imply her baseless claims regarding the independence and integrity of some key institutions in Singapore were ""ignored"" by the voters, instead of the voters agree with it.

Regarding subversive ideology of Marxism, you're spinning her stance out of context. She did not support Marxism. She merely liked a figure in a Marxist book regarding feminism aspect. She already clarified she did not agree with other beliefs held by the person other than feminism aspect which she was talking in her tweet

Moreover, PAP at the point had supermajority share in the parliament.

The function of President of Singapore only takes real effect when PAP no longer dominates the Parliament with a supermajority share.

The results of the study was that only 70% of those aged <30 were ok with a Singaporean Indian PM, and only 63% were okay with a Singaporean Malay PM. The numbers percentage only goes down as you go down the age group, with only 42% of those aged 50 and above being ok with a Malay PM. It's sad to see that there is such a stigma against Malays and Indians in Singapore, but the prejudice would not change overnight. The results show that a sizable chunk of the SG population are not ok with a non-Chinese PM.

And further more, it's one thing to make a racist comment and another to incite anger within the minorities group, whilst at the same time casting doubt on our legal system, all the while being a politician and without basis or evidence. 

What other racist comments have you I heard? I'm afraid I'm not aware of them. I remember something about some politician making a joke about him being in little India and not being able to see anything because he was surrounded by Indians or something like that.

I don't know any racist comments by LKY. What I do know is that in the past he managed to win the votes of a primarily Malay GRC against all odds, being a primarily Chinese party. And when they found that Malays were under-performing in school compared to the Chinese, he set up an organisation to combat that and provide tuition, or something along those lines.

As the prime minister you need to the the general population's trust. You can't impose a law to make the racists change their minds.

As for the SME companies poll, which is again hypothetical, let's say you made it mandatory to pay pregnant women. What will then happen is that companies will then stop hiring women who are attached (this is already happening in some countries). Are you going to force companies to hire women? You may push foreign companies to leave by making our business scene less competitive. That will negatively affect not just the pregnant women but the whole population.

The core of this problem is this: businesses will prioritize productivity. Inevitably, being pregnant will decrease one's productivity. It's the hard truth.

I'm not saying that it's not a problem if pregnant women aren't paid. It is a real problem. But merely imposing a legislation to force companies to hire them won't solve the root issue.

Same goes for the PM problem. The root problem is that there are portions of the population who are racist. How would you combat that? If we make a legislation that the people have no say in the PM? The racist bunch will just vent their frustrations against the non-Chinese PM, and pick on every little miss-step or blame every dissatisfaction onto him. Should we then censor what little free speech have, saying ""no negative remarks can be made about a non-Chinese PM""? That would be dangerous and going towards totalitarianism.

I am against racism, as any person should be. But that doesn't change the fact that there are racist people, and even they have a right to their opinions. All we can do is better educate the next generation to not be racist so that we can attain a better and more true meritocracy.

To your point, there were whole wars and battles that broke out when people wanted to end slavery. That's how the civil war broke out in America. It lasted 5 years. And in our position, Singapore cannot afford to have anything remotely close to a civil war, riot, or even just old people rambling online radicalising each other.

There will be racial tension, the political unrest will affect businesses and investment, it's a all round shit show for everyone.

There's a difference between reserving jobs for a race and ensuring there is no social unrest. 

I'm not saying we should allow paedophiles and rapists because they have a right to their opinions. Again, you're forcing an analogy when there isn't one. We can't legislate prejudice and opinions. We can only legislate against acting on them. A rapist is only a rapist when he commits rape, and thus he has commited the act and should be punished and castrated for all I care. A pedophile could find that he has attraction towards those of young age and choose to not act on it, or even choose to chemically castrate himself. We cannot arrest him for merely having thoughts. If he tries to catfish a minor or finds child pornography, by all means arrest and imprison that monster. Again, you see how we cannot control what other people think? We can only act on their actions

Thinking that your PM shouldn't be non-chinese is racist. But stating that there are racists that don't want a non-chinese PM is not. Neither is it racist to prioritise social stability for all.

You still haven't answer this question. I'm saying it's not a racist statement because it's based on fact. Facts can't be racist. The racist ones are the older generation mentioned in the statement, not the person who made the statement.

And you also haven't answered my other question, is the Asoc Proffessor Halid then racist for bringing up the question in the first place? How so?

Occam's razor isn't applied in this way and it's not a law either. Just look at wikipedia: ""In the scientific method, Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result"" Occam's razor is closer to a parable than a law.",t3_hyljex,29-07-2020

If you can't elaborate on why the statement it's racist, maybe it's because it's not?

On the other hand, I can elaborate on why HSK statement isn't racist:
1) it isn't his own view, he is merely commenting on the views of others.
2) he is not promoting racism by stating that there are racists. Just because I say some people are short doesn't mean I'm promoting short people.
3) the statement is backed up by a study in 2016. It is merely facts.

For the same reasons, the Asoc Proffessor's question isn't racist, but a direct inquiry on the sentiments of the population and the PAP.

In the end nothing was done, which led to the chaotic use of PMDs, and ensuing conflict between all the people sharing the footpaths and park connectors (which are indirect, winding, and not built to connect residences to workplaces).

1165,19,fxny356,t1_fxnmk42,"Again this cars vs PMD debate...

Since you are comparing to a car, PMDs are not banned but just limited to park connector and cycling paths. Like cars, it takes time for Singapore to build its road infrastructure and does not happen overnight so wait for government to build the park connectors?",t3_hp4pfm,11-07-2020
1166,19,fxsngtx,t1_fxnqggk,"Lack of existing infrastructure and political will was to blame, imo. PMDs aren't really a new thing, and have been around for a few years before the 2018-2019 boom. The writing was already on the wall and yet nothing was done to address the issue of pedestrians and riders having to share the same path. The only feasible way out of this mess is to quickly build up the necessary infrastructure (dedicated PMD/bicycle paths or lanes) and slowly ease back on the restrictions.",t3_hp4pfm,12-07-2020

1169,19,fxo7o2n,t1_fxny356,"This isn't that far off from an outright ban, especially since most people who actually need it are using it as delivery vehicles. 

At least back then when cars were new, it was mostly used by the rich as a fancy new thing. They could have done a whole slew of things. Tighter regulations, special permits for delivery people, more rigorous checks on different brands etc, but nope, they chose the easy way out and kicked so many of those doing the gig economy on the curb. 

Infrastructure isn't built overnight, but income can be lost overnight.",t3_hp4pfm,11-07-2020
1170,19,fxpeyro,t1_fxp7wct,"Hmmm bicycle share not really their fault la. 

Yellow box was done to ensure that the bicycles were placed neatly. 

Think that was a combination of Singaporeans being idiots and the bike sharing companies being trash.",t3_hp4pfm,11-07-2020
1171,19,fxojej9,t1_fxo7o2n,"So what kind of regulations can you suggest that accommodate to PMD riders to pedestrians and make both parties happy?

PMD aren’t like cars. They aren’t restricted to roads. You can come up a lot of small restrictions and there are still a lot of inconsiderate riders (including some food delivery riders) that are going to break the law. There is not enough enforcement officers or traffic cameras to cover all pavement and void decks. Enforcement officers are also not even allowed to use force to stop them.

Also not all pedestrians are alert all the time. There are young kids, elderly or people who are listening to music on their earphones on the pavement. Sometimes no matter how careful the PMD riders are, if the pedestrians suddenly did some unexpected turn, accidents happen too. Cannot be now even walking on the pavement requires safety training too right? Or blame an elderly for doing a sudden right turn?

Nevertheless I don’t think it is possible to prevent all PMD accidents until we allocate a cycling paths just for them and only for them.

I think the government did mess up by allowing PMD in without considering all the issues and resolving them before the people are too accommodated to the conveniences of having a PMD. And even without PMD, they should have build a cycling path sooner for cyclists too.",t3_hp4pfm,11-07-2020

1945,19,fkh0e2v,t1_fkgsezu,"Lol, take a look at the ongoing discussion here. No one is even questioning the GRC system in itself and asking ""Why is my single vote for 3/4 representatives? Shouldn't I cast that for each representative separately?""",t3_fic3pl,14-03-2020

1947,19,fkh3wgq,t1_fkh0e2v,"Well said. People also tend to ignore the fact that GRCs are set up in such a way that the bar for entry is raised significantly for the competition and is skewed heavily in favour of the incumbent. The whole ""minority representation"" schtick is a poor excuse, and has the heavily implication that voters are a bunch of racists. If anything, unhappiness with govt policies is a potent tool for racial unity (Anson By-election, anyone?)",t3_fic3pl,14-03-2020
1948,19,fkjdxdf,t1_fkh3wgq,"I personally think the GRC system allows a party to build a team with people of complementary skill sets which can serve their constituents better. One person can work the ground perhaps, another with great town council management skills, one with financial expertise etc. I much prefer it over having to entrust an area to a single individual who isn’t well rounded enough.

We are land-poor but talent rich. Why not have a different system of representation compared to other countries? We set up every aspect of our society to maximize our advantages and minimize our weaknesses. Why not governance and representation as well?",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
1949,19,fkjf7h2,t1_fkjdxdf,"They're both sides of the same coin, inho. And while it does sound good on paper, the current practice is for MPs to be allocated certain neighbourhoods/precincts that they're in charge of, which is not much different from that of running a SMC. It is also quite hard for MPs to cover overlapping areas to ensure well-rounded support for the people, as a single neighbourhood alone consists of multiple families, let alone trying to canvas multiple neighbourhoods at once.

There's also the thorny issue of GRCs being used to ""parachute"" (allegedly) otherwise unelectable newcomers into parliament. Take Dr Koh Poh Koon, for instance. Despite being hailed as the son of Punggol, he did not run again for Punggol East SMC in GE2015. Rather, he campaigned under the AMK GRC team instead, where it was arguably easier to gain admittance into Parliament as compared to campaigning alone in a SMC.

It is therefore my opinion that the concept of GRCs should be relooked at and perhaps amended to be more democratic.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
1950,19,fkjhrij,t1_fkjf7h2,"Funny how I look at those aspects as positives rather than negatives. Being able to divide and coalesce responsibilities where appropriate - that’s the strength of group representation. Obviously some tasks are better tackled individually, and some tasks are better tackled collectively. That’s efficiency and we’re bloody efficient if nothing else.

The GRC system being able to bring in high potential but low experience representatives is also a fantastic strength. That’s how we groom young executives in large corporations - bring them into a team to work on big projects they otherwise could never get exposure to on their own, get them to learn from experienced mentors, and eventually fulfill their potential. It’s a fantastic system, compared to young hopefuls being thrust into SMCs with no experience or guidance. Again, it’s efficient, proven and similar to methods employed by tons of extremely successful organizations.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
1951,19,fkjj7sp,t1_fkjhrij,"And herein lies the rub. The system benefits incumbents greatly, while simultaneously raising the bar for any team willing to mount a challenge. No offense, but the way you're looking at it reminds me of the mindset of a business executive. Sure, what you're proposing is great from an organisational standpoint, but from a democratic point of view, it is deeply flawed. If we're truly about electing the best team for the job, why is there a huge divide in requirements for both sides? Sure, one could argue that the incoming party would have to prove themselves first and that some measure of safeguards have to be in place. But the current playing field is so skewed that it might as well be a one-sided game of chess.

And last I checked, we're still a democracy, not a one-party centralised dictatorship like China.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020

You really had to be brave because many believed the myth that you and your family would be blacklisted when they find out that you voted for the opposition. 

In addition, LKY used to threaten them alot: ""This meant that MPs had responsibility for local services but no control over their funding, creating a mechanism through which the PAP could openly threaten to punish constituencies which elect opposition parties, by withholding public services until PAP constituencies had first been supplied, and warn the electorate against voting for the opposition. In 1985, after the PAP lost 2 seats in the 1984 election, Minister for National Development Teh Cheang Wan stated that the PAP would prioritise PAP constituencies in providing public services; future PM Goh Chok Tong stated that this would make voters “think a little more carefully before they cast their votes.” He reiterated this when in power, suggesting that opposition-held constituencies would be placed at the back of the “queue” when it came to upgrading works. More recently, Lee Kuan Yew warned that Aljunied’s residents would “pay a price, the hard way” if the PAP lost Aljunied GRC. “Voters [will] have 5 years to repent… You must expect the PAP to look after PAP constituencies first.”""

I was quite surprised at the lack of good videos from other parties. So much time to prepare - everyone could see elections coming from weeks and months away, exact week doesn't matter - and yet not much quality prep. Only WPs social media team seemed in touch.

Also quite disappointed in the quality of all the online rallies. Crap video quality crap audio quality. Crap video production. I mean, compared to a decent YouTuber with free OBS software. I don't understand how they can afford to hold physical rallies but not set up a nice online video stream that looks good and sounds good. PAP was also crap at this despite their deep pockets. Only mediacorp had decent mics and setup. Okay things improved after a few days but wtf.

Lack of generated social media soundbites and shareables. Sheesh. 

It's like all these people still think that only physical handshakes are worth anything. I didnt even see a single candidate (from far) in person throughout the two weeks. Much less talk or interact with one. Definitely no house visit either. 
It's a bloody covid phase2 situation too. 
Not to mention lots of poor candidate broadcasts...that's the best you can do after all the practice?

Jamus could not have executed such a killer summation if Vivian kept Jamus ""inside the ring"" and kept bodyslamming him. Vivian's mistake was to focus on dismantling others instead of Jamus. Vivian has extra time, so he could choose which stage to fight. He just chose the wrong fights and let Jamus serve that killer summation. Vivian's seductive smiles at Jamus only helped Jamus.

TLDR; It was vivian who unknowingly unleashed the demonspawn that is Jamus who went on to win Sengkang. At the time Vivian endorsed Jamus at the debatting table to keep Jamus on his side, Vivian never knew he was unleashing the Godzilla of Sengkang. Had Vivian gone full aggro against Jamus, Jamus would not be able to execute that MVP summation that made him an overnight media darling.",t3_hp6olz,11-07-2020
2381,19,fxnmibt,t3_hp6olz,"Some of these points are really spot-on. And as a Sengkang voter, I did take in account the teaser video. It was badass. And the music!

2382,19,fxn2or7,t3_hp6olz,"Personally, I feel that PAP is going all-in in the mentality that ""scaring"" or ""threatening"" the younger generation is a valid plan to get them to vote for PAP.

While this may be true for some of them, eventually there will come a point whereby additional ""scares"" or ""threats"" will no longer have anymore meaning. And this is when the younger generation will start voting for the oppositions. 1 thing I personally feel the PAP did not and may never do well is utilizing social media and the power behind it properly. For example regarding JoTeo and the FW case, all she needed was to publicly apologise (she doesn't even have to mean it), and that will be able to gain the respect of some of the youths. But instead she doubled down and insisted that no apology is demanded.

Take a look at Hong Kong, no matter how many times China has imposed new law and regulations to silence the youths there, they remain strong and continued fighting. Unless PAP does something drastic to improve their reputation, as long as there are worthy oppositions members, eventually PAP will lose out.",t3_hp6olz,11-07-2020
2383,19,fxnqnwx,t3_hp6olz,"I have a pet theory that the ELD queueing/ voting hour extension fiasco played a significant part especially since the winning margin was relatively tight.

Given that voting had to be extended by 2 hours, I can surmise that some voters were in queue for at least 1 or 2 hours, if not more. The length of the queue, the clusterfuck in the midst of an ongoing pandemic, the unusual voting hour extension and by some reddit accounts, poorly run polling operation, were all stark and symbolic reminders of the PAP's failings, especially with regards to handling the Covid-19 pandemic.

I can imagine how undecided swing voters whom perhaps were only leaning slightly towards either side, or perhaps were going to vote at random or spoil their vote, resolved to vote against the PAP because the ridiculous queues reminded and reignited in them all the frustrations and grievances people had with the PAP. 

""What mandate? Can't even run the election voting process properly, still want to ask for mandate. KNN want to vote for PAP also cannot.""

They have a larger risk appetite and are willing to give fresh opposition faces a chance to run on the track and build their own track records.

They also recognise the dumbassery that is ""you can't drive the family car yet because you just got your license and you need more experience"", or ""entry level job requiring 3 years of experience"".

The comparison with the incumbent begins.  WP need not play to win, they need to play “not to lose” to stand a chance. they have not mount any direct “offensive” against the incumbent, but the incumbent has mount several “offensives” during the online rally.  it seems like by not trading offensives, WP may have won some over to their side because some may be uncomfortable with the approach used by the incumbent. that’s playing not to lose.

it is reasonable to accept that sk will have more swing voters compared to other grcs this time, when you have a choice to decide between 2 credible opponents. i believe both parties have more work to do, to convince these group of swing voters, just by virtue of the quality on both sides. how? the grc broadcast is a very good opportunity to do so. it will be a race down to the wire.",t3_hlfc9r,05-07-2020

Also, the demographic is a lot younger, given that the neighbourhood expanded quite quickly with a lot of new BTO’s in the last few years - you can noticeably observe this while walking around... a lot of young couples and families.

Ever since the debate between VB and Jamus, perhaps WP realised Jamus ""has attracted"" a lot of attention and he should be at the forefront of WP SK.

It is unlikely that WP will win this time run(not impossible just unlikely). WP should be happy if PAP's vote share falls below 55%, which would already represent close to if not more than a 10% swing.

(in contrast, the ever changing shape of adjacent AMK GRC suggests that this is a key defensive). Also, the PAP team might be deliberately kept weak. NCM while holding minister rank has no active portfolio (like a reserve player) while LPM has some flak re PMD issued. Amrin is apparently not popular too. PAP could have easily shuffled another minister in if they wanted to. PAP is doing so as a form of damage control - see how they amputated Fengshan off from EC last time round, and put in a newcomer too. In fact, as in turned out the two office holders in EC were retiring anyway so fair to say that even PAP was prepared to write off EC that time.

That said, PAP put in a suicide squad for Aljunied last GE and they nearly won it back. It would be more uphill for WP in an area that they haven't actually won yet, especially with the COVID tide.",t3_hlfc9r,05-07-2020

> SINGAPORE - A 37-year-old Bangladeshi worker died in an accident at a construction site in Sengkang on Friday morning (Nov 22).

> He was caught between metal barricades and the counterweight of a crawler crane when the crane rotated, said a spokesman from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).

> The site developer is the Housing Board, while the contractor is Ken-Pal.

> The worker was employed by construction firm He Zhan.

> He was taken unconscious to Sengkang General Hospital, where he later died, said the police.

> They were alerted to the industrial accident along 339 Anchorvale Road at about 9am.

> MOM and the police are investigating the incident.

> When contacted, Ken-Pal declined to comment as the matter is still under investigations.

> This is the second reported industrial accident in the area this year. In March, a 36-year-old man, an Indian national, was killed after he was struck by a sheet pile at a Sengkang construction site at 327C Anchorvale Road.

> Related Story Indian worker who died in crane collapse in Novena was father-to-be

> MOM said the occupier of the worksite then was Ken-Pal, while the worker was employed by Harris Construction.

> Earlier this month, a construction crane collapsed at the work site of an upcoming rehabilitation hub in Novena, killing an Indian construction worker, 28, and injuring a Bangladeshi worker, 35.

Personally working I'm this industry, what makes you think this way? Just wanted to know why there is such an impression. 




So far it's usually the workers not wanting to adhere to safety guidelines is usually due to laziness and sometimes its uncomfortable. Employers also cant enforce everyone due to the amount of worker plus laziness. Employers also cant be round the clock at the site to make sure they follow the rules, chances are there is another ongoing project else where. The shit that employers of these workers need to deal with when a consultant / client saw the workers not following the rules isn't fun either. 




Of course these are just what I observed from my own projects and I'm still relatively ""new"" in this industry. Totally not talking about this case since it's still unconfirmed how it happened.",t3_dzz21w,22-11-2019
2600,19,f8bh351,t1_f8bcgz1,Yeah most people think we’re doing the workers a favour by letting them work in sg in the first place,t3_dzz21w,22-11-2019
2601,19,f8cxfmy,t1_f8cm4k3,"To add on:

It is practically cheaper and thus favourable for the employers to enforce safety at workplace. Everytime this happens, the project need to stop work and tons of additional cost to handle the aftermath of the accident.
My point is that most, if not all employers, are already being responsible about safety. They provide necessary safety equipments and follow the guidelines. But whether everyone involved are strictly following them....is another matter.",t3_dzz21w,23-11-2019
2602,19,f8cf2wj,t1_f8bh351,"I mean we are. The wages they get here are surely way higher than if they were to work as a construction worker back home. It’s a reciprocal relationship. That being said, these workers deserve a safe working environment, as does everyone else.",t3_dzz21w,22-11-2019
2603,19,f8cgzax,t1_f8cf2wj,"Its not a favor if they also represent a significantly cheaper option than others. Singapore might be less likely to rebuild stuff so often if labor costs were 40, 50% higher. So yes, it's transactional but not reciprocal",t3_dzz21w,22-11-2019
2604,19,f8chz4c,t1_f8cgzax,Okay either way my point is it’s not that there isn’t a benefit for them in coming to work here.,t3_dzz21w,22-11-2019
2605,19,f8cxl4u,t1_f8chz4c,And my point is that the benefit and exploitation are not mutually exclusive. Just because they get paid better than elsewhere doesn't mean it's ok to mistreat them or disrespect them,t3_dzz21w,23-11-2019

2618,19,fxmouo3,t1_fxlvujo,"I disagree that this is the solution. 

All FPTP systems, including SMC only, results in traditionally disproportionate translations of votes to seats.

Also worth saying that regarding minority representation, in SG 30 years ago most minority MPs got voted in before HDB racial policy quotas separated and distributed over the island, removing areas that are favorable for minority races. There is also significant statistical evidence that FPTP systems with no minority checks in place does disadvantage minority representation.

But regarding more proportional representation... Abolishing GRCs resolves the ""carry burden"" issue but not the lack of proportional representation.

We will need an electoral system that uses some form of PR voting in addition to FPTP. We need some form of parallel voting system imo, but for the same chamber. Would solve the issue of ""prefer opp party, but i like my PAP candidate"". Would also solve the issue of ""i dont like my PAP candidates, but the party has a good track record of leading SG"", since most votes for opposition dont have much to do with thinking WP will form a better cabinet",t3_hp2obl,11-07-2020

East Coast’s population has flatlined due to it being a mature estate, but Sengkang looks like it will grow further as a non-mature estate. I think when Sengkang reaches 130K voters, EBRC, as usual playbook, will not touch Sengkang but upgrade it to a 5 man GRC. at 130k voters, many 5 man GRCs are that size, like Jurong (129K), Tanjong Pagar (134K). The unequal voting power in Singapore is real man.",t3_hprpwr,12-07-2020
2746,19,fxvkry9,t1_fxvfggs,"If Sengkang upgrades to a 5-member GRC, and assuming the WP freshmen prove their track record, won't it help expand WP presence in Parliament (assuming their odds of re-election are high)? And assuming PAP doesn't pull an East Coast plan and field an undefeatable minister there.

Also just took a look at the Sengkang GRC map - it's saturated with tons of residential space already (with lack of green spaces...). What are the odds of further development?",t3_hprpwr,12-07-2020
2747,19,fxvlhx4,t1_fxvkry9,"I think we need to think of the young voters that will come out to vote once they reach 21. For example, Aljunied GRC’s voters grew from 143k voters (2011), to 148K (2015) and 151K (2020). Just very strange that we need make 5 man GRCs bigger than a fast growing Sengkang. Then many wards in Singapore need to consolidate already haha. But, I don’t think any minister wants to take the jump. What if they lose and they lose their cushy, 7 digit job? We could say fielding a retired minister there... but who would want to do that? Most of them would rather walk into a glorified everlasting sunset than a sullied electoral record? That being said, I may be wrong. Just studying trends that PAP always fields GRAs for opposition wards, but who knows, Heng might pull something off in a new playbook. (But PAP needs to reconsider the Minister star power after he, with 53%, and Desmond, Iswaran with 51%, almost got thrown off the bus).",t3_hprpwr,12-07-2020
2748,19,fxvm87k,t1_fxvlhx4,"Thanks for the stats. If ELD is truly wary about touching opposition ward boundaries, I hope they'll be careful the next time round knowing some GRCs may easily fall to the Opposition.

The optimist in me hopes that after 2025 there will be a strong Opposition enclave in the Northeast/East comprising urban-sensible and planning-optimized GRCs. WP proving that they can run these wards well will hopefully make the revolving door of Town Councils elsewhere in Singapore a thing of the past.

Sengkang GRC seems to be the most sensible GRC to be drawn up operationally and logistically, as far as I can tell. I hope this signals a start to a new trend.",t3_hprpwr,12-07-2020

> A woman has died after falling from the 15th floor of an HDB flat in Sengkang on Aug. 7 evening.

> The incident happened at Blk 279C at Compassvale.

> In response to Mothership's queries, the police confirmed that they received a call for assistance on Aug. 7, at 6:04pm.

> A 26-year-old woman was found motionless at the foot of said block and was pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic.

> According to Chinese newspaper, Lianhe Zaobao, the deceased is allegedly a domestic helper who was living with a family of four.

> Zaobao reported that the domestic helper would help to pick up the young daughter of the family at the childcare centre.

> She did not show up that day, so the teacher called the girl's mother who later found out that the helper had died from the fall.

> The Zaobao reporter understands from a resident, known only as Tan, that the domestic helper appeared cheery. She often wore a smile whenever they met and would sing at home.

> Tan added that she observed the domestic helper had an amicable relationship with her employers and she had been working for the family for a few months.

> Pricing not a mistake

> On May 9, 2019, Loh, one of the co-founders of socio-political site The Online Citizen, wrote a Facebook post about his meal at Koufu in Sengkang General Hospital.

> According to the post, a plate of economical rice with two meat dishes and one vegetable dish had cost him S$6.60:

> In disbelief, Loh asked the server about the price, who broke it down to S$2 per ingredient, and another S$0.60 for the rice.

> However, the vegetable dish may have been counted as a meat item, due to the minced meat used.

> Elsewhere, the average price for the same portion is around S$3.50 – S$4.

> With a cup of tea at S$1.80, Loh’s meal totalled S$8.40.

> This was Loh’s Facebook caption:

> “This plate of food, $6.60. Koufu at Sengkang General Hospital. Got a shock. I asked the server: how come 6.60? Ya, he said. 2 meat and I veggie – each $2. Rice $0.60.

> Speaking to the Chinese daily, a 28-year-old customer observed that prices at this foodcourt are comparatively higher than other hospitals’ foodcourts.

> “With a drink, a meal will cost at least S$7 – S$8. My family and I would rather visit other independent eateries in the hospital or the shopping mall opposite. Prices are about the same, but the quality of the food is better than the average foodcourt’s.

> Another resident argued that the prices shouldn’t be that high, as those who visit the public hospital are average citizens.

> Koufu: Different operating costs

> In an interview with Zaobao, a spokesperson for Koufu explained that the operating costs at Sengkang General Hospital differs from that of other areas, therefore affecting prices.

> The spokesperson added that since last year end, stalls have been selling value meals for S$2.80, and hospital staff enjoy discounts as well.

> “We’ll gather the public’s feedback and reflect if there’s a need to adjust the prices of certain food items, in order to ensure that it’s something everyone can afford.

> An industry insider explained that the food at hospitals’ food court may be more expensive due to its location and longer operating hours, which raises overhead costs.

SINGAPORE - Former political office-holder and MP Amrin Amin has moved to the tech sector and will be taking up roles at two local firms, following his exit from the Government after the recent general election.

Mr Amrin, 42, has been appointed strategy director at robotics and automation firm Platform for Bots and Automation (PBA). Mr Amrin, a lawyer by training, will also take up the role of non-executive adviser at ADERA Global, a company involved in data-security, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation.

The People's Action Party (PAP) Sengkang GRC candidate, whose team [lost to the Workers' Party in GE2020, ](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ge2020-results-wp-projected-to-win-sengkang-grc-with-53-of-votes-based-on-sample-count)officially starts both roles on Sept 14 but has already been attending meetings and on-boarding himself in these companies.

Mr Amrin was previously senior parliamentary secretary for Home Affairs and Health and an MP for Sembawang GRC, helming the Woodlands ward.

Speaking to The Straits Times at PBA's office in Yishun on Friday (Sept 4), he said he started thinking about job-hunting the day after[ Polling Day on July 10.](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ge2020-pap-returns-to-power-with-83-seats-but-loses-sengkang-and-aljunied-grcs-in-hard)

A former partner at a law firm, Mr Amrin said that returning to the legal field would have been the ""easy way"", but the cutting-edge quality of the tech sector excited him and he wanted to try something new.

""I think that I've checked that box,"" he said, referring to the legal sector.

""And I was looking ahead, what's hot right now, and what is going to add value to my life experience. And the answer must be to venture into new areas, to stretch my potential beyond legal and government.""

But when asked if this meant he would not be returning to either politics or law, Mr Amrin laughed and said ""never say never"".

""We cannot be living in our past, neither do we want to get too ahead of ourselves,"" he added.

## SENGKANG GRC

Mr Amrin has no regrets contesting Sengkang GRC, which was [newly carved out for the recent election ](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/new-grc-has-the-unpredictability-factor)and made up of the former single seats of Sengkang West and Punggol East as well as the Sengkang Central ward of Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

""Do I regret contesting in Sengkang? Definitely not. No regrets because it's a great honour. A great honour to fight one of the toughest battles for the party and stand up for what I believe in,"" he said.

The [PAP team lost to WP MPs](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/team-sengkang) He Ting Ru, Jamus Lim, Louis Chia and Raeesah Khan, who[ received 52.1 per cent of the vote.](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/how-wp-won-over-sengkang)

Mr Amrin campaigned together with labour chief and former minister Ng Chee Meng, former senior minister of state Lam Pin Min and PAP newcomer, lawyer Raymond Lye.

Mr Ng remains the [secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress, ](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/govt-will-work-closely-with-labour-chief-ng-chee-meng-even-though-he-is-not-in-cabinet-pm)while Dr Lam has returned to medical practice. He is the chief executive officer and a director at the Eagle Eye Centre.

Mr Amrin, who became an MP in 2015, said the PAP had a good team running in Sengkang but they respect the voters' choice, as that is ""the nature of life and politics"".

As much as the result did surprise him, it was the reactions of people who expressed their support after the loss that left him most surprised.

In Government, Mr Amrin had, among other things, worked to [get former offenders back on their feet](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-former-offenders-will-get-more-help-to-become-more-employable) and supported the role of Home Team officers. He was also involved in uplifting efforts for the Malay-Muslim community.

As he spoke about the people who thanked him for his service, Mr Amrin turned emotional.

""I thought I was just a small cog in the whole system, just trying my best to do my part, but I was very touched and humbled by the depth of sincerity of people who came up to share about the impact of my work, and urged me to continue to serve the people,"" he said.",t3_inh3ca,06-09-2020

TECH SECTOR

Mr Amrin said he is looking forward to using his experience to grow the companies he will be working for.

At PBA, he said he will focus on its Robotics Automation Centre of Excellence academy, which trains budding robotics professionals, including mid-career workers.

It has trained more than 700 people since 2018, and has supplied over 100 firms with workers.

He will also be helping both PBA and ADERA expand their business here and overseas. ADERA runs initiatives like a digital payment system in the Philippines and unmanned automated banking machines in Cambodia.

""These are very exciting developments. And important too because it enlarges Singapore's economic footprint. It provides Singaporeans with more jobs,"" said Mr Amrin.

Being in the private sector complements his experience in law, community work and government, he said, adding that it will give him a chance to observe creative and technological trends here.

Mr Amrin said he now gets to spend more time with his one-year-old daughter and his wife, a family doctor.

He has been enjoying going to the park and baby gym, and catching up on Korean dramas. A post last month on his Facebook account for K-drama recommendations garnered over 2,000 reactions.

He remains committed to public service as PAP's Sengkang Central branch chairman. He said the ""work continues"" for him and his running mates.

""We'll just have to do our best as party activists, not as elected officials of course, having lost the elections. But we do our best as party activists in that constituency,"" he said, declining to reveal more.

With a sizeable social media following of close to 55,000 on Facebook and 19,000 on Instagram, Mr Amrin intends to continue speaking up on issues that matter to him and for people who society might overlook, like blue-collar workers and former offenders.

""I will still keep my ears close to the ground. It is a habit that is hard to kick,"" he said.

> According to the Facebook post, a woman had reminded the youths to put their masks on, however, they apparently did not listen and laughed and smiled in response.

> The post has since garnered over 1,700 shares and reactions.

> Many criticised the pair, with some pointing out that the relaxed measures in the recent weeks were by no means a sign that masks were no longer needed.

> No change to wearing mask policy in Phase 2

> Singapore's Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) co-chair and Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong had reinforced that members of the public must continue to wear masks while out and about during Phase 2.

> He said:

> ""Yes, the wearing of masks will continue to apply as a requirement in Phase 2, whenever you are out. So there's no change to the wearing rule regarding wearing of masks.""

> SINGAPORE: A man who co-hosted an illegal gathering of 18 people at his Sengkang flat during the ""circuit breaker"" period was fined S$5,000 on Friday (Sep 11) for breaking a COVID-19 regulation.

> Leong Chee Mun, 37, received a heftier fine than his co-host and then-fiancee, as he had lied to the police when they knocked on his door, saying that only he and his then-fiancee were home.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He pleaded guilty to one count of permitting people not from his household to enter his flat for a social gathering. A second charge of meeting the 16 guests for a social gathering was taken into consideration.

> The court heard that Leong was engaged to co-accused Cassie Ong Shi Hong at the time. She was fined S$4,000 last month.

> They agreed to hold a social gathering at their Compassvale Crescent flat after a friend suggested it, and 16 guests went to their flat on May 8.

> They came into close contact with each other during the gathering - eating, drinking alcohol, playing games and watching Netflix.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> This went on until a neighbour called the police at 2am saying there were ""a lot of youngsters"" entering and leaving the flat.

> When the police arrived, an officer heard noises from inside the flat and saw many pieces of footwear outside. He also heard shushing noises from inside the flat when he knocked.

> The door was eventually opened by Leong, who said he had been sleeping and lied that he and his then-fiancee were the only ones inside. He later said there were eight to 10 people in the flat, but the police entered and found 16 guests inside.

> PROSECUTOR ASKS FOR HIGHER FINE AS HE LIED TO POLICE

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Wei Liang asked for a fine of at least S$5,000 for Leong. He said most of the guests had been fined between S$2,500 and S$3,000, while Ong was fined S$4,000.

> ""We are submitting for a higher fine given that there is a serious aggravating factor, which is that he had knowingly lied to the police officer at the entrance of the unit,"" said Mr Lee.

> He said the lie was given ""with a view to conceal wrongdoing"", and that Leong did not come clean immediately, saying at first that there were only eight to 10 people inside.

> Defence lawyer James Ch'ng said a fine of S$4,000 would be sufficient, noting that his client was not the organiser of the event.

> ""The choice of venue was one of mere convenience,"" he said, adding that it was to avoid a meeting in public.

> ""This was a private event. It was not done in full view of the public. There was no intention to have a public disregard of the COVID-19 regulations,"" said Mr Ch'ng.

> He said Leong was stressed at the time because of his employment situation. He was jobless during the circuit breaker period and took up delivery jobs to support his then-fiancee and his child from a previous marriage.

> HE HAS IN A SENSE ALREADY BEEN PUNISHED: DEFENCE

> ""Ultimately, the accused had a lapse of judgment and regrets his actions. Even without the punishment of this court, he has in a sense already been punished,"" he continued.

> He said that Leong's relationship with his former fiancee and co-host broke down in the fallout.

> ""He ultimately submits to the mercy of this court,"" said Mr Ch'ng.

> In response, the prosecutor said: ""They were not supposed to have met. They should just have not met, whether in private, public or anywhere else, because the purpose of this gathering was entirely frivolous.""

> He added that it was ""not strange at all"" for Leong to receive a higher fine than Ong, as there was a distinguishing factor of his knowing lies to the police.

> The judge agreed that a higher fine for Leong was warranted and gave him a fine of S$5,000, with two weeks' jail in default if he did not pay.

> For breaking a COVID-19 regulation, he could have been jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both.

> SINGAPORE - The S11 Dormitory in Punggol is Singapore's largest Covid-19 cluster, with over 2,400 cases to date. It is supported by Sengkang General Hospital, Singapore's newest hospital, which is just 3km away.

> Some of the S11 residents had in fact helped to build Sengkang Hospital, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Thursday (April 30), as he paid tribute to migrant workers and thanked them for their contributions to Singapore in his May Day message.

> ""One worker who was hospitalised told his doctor that he had laid the tiles in the ward he was staying in. The Sengkang Hospital medical team were moved. They were happy to be able to give back directly to the workers,"" PM Lee said.

> ""May Day is a day of celebration for all workers, including migrant workers. I too send my thanks and good wishes to all migrant workers in Singapore, for what you have built and contributed here.""

> PM Lee noted that there were still many Covid-19 cases in the migrant worker dormitories. ""Fortunately, most of them are mild, probably because the workers are young. Nevertheless, we are doing everything we can for their health and welfare.""

> He noted the Government has assigned medical teams from hospitals to provide support in the dorms.

> In his speech, PM Lee also acknowledged that the circuit breaker measures have been difficult for everyone, as the restrictions have disrupted businesses and jobs, and created considerable inconvenience.

> ""But you have been resilient, and you have taken this in your stride,"" he added. ""I am especially grateful to our brothers and sisters working in essential services, who have kept Singapore going.""

> He thanked healthcare professionals, officers from the Home Team, Singapore Armed Forces and the Ministry of Manpower, and others.

> ""Our public transport workers, security guards, cleaners, social service professionals, delivery riders and taxi drivers. Our teachers, who have worked hard to implement home-based learning, and pre-school teachers too.

> ""All of you have made sacrifices and exceeded the call of duty. Your families too have stood by your side, supporting you. To all of you, I want to say a big thank you,"" he said.

2998,19,fvwt355,t3_hfd708,"The race for the new four-member Sengkang GRC will likely see a strong contest between the People’s Action Party (PAP) and the Workers’ Party (WP), political observers say.  

The WP will “almost certainly” challenge the PAP there, said former Nominated Member of Parliament Eugene Tan, who added further: “Will one of the Aljunied GRC MPs lead the WP team there? Regardless, the WP will give the PAP a run for its money.”

In the 2015 General Election, the PAP's Charles Chong narrowly won Punggol East with 51.8 per cent of the votes against the WP's Lee Li Lian.

The PAP's share of the vote in Sengkang West, 62.1 per cent, was also below the party's national average of 69.9 per cent in 2015, Assoc Prof Tan noted.​​​​​​​

He added that Sengkang has a younger demographic - voters predominantly in their 20s to 40s who may not be so “wedded” to the PAP, unlike the older generation.

“It’s also a new GRC and so the advantage of incumbency is somewhat reduced,” he said.

Associate Professor Bilveer Singh from the political science department at the National University of Singapore (NUS) echoed the same view, pointing to the WP’s “geographical strategy”, which is not constituency-centric.

Sengkang West, Punggol East, Hougang and Aljunied are areas where the WP holds “strong appeal”, he said. The WP is incumbent in Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC.

“Even if Ng Chee Meng stands there as a major minister, or anyone else, I think it's not going to be easy going,” said Assoc Prof Singh amid speculation that Mr Ng, who is currently a Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP, could contest in Sengkang GRC.

A strong fight can be expected if WP also deploys at least one known name in Sengkang GRC, said Mr Leonard Lim, country director of Singapore at government affairs and public policy consultancy Vriens & Partners. He cited former Non-Constituency Member of Parliament Gerald Giam and former Punggol East MP Lee Li Lian as examples.

Mr Lim added that as a former MP for Sengkang West, Senior Minister of State for Transport Dr Lam Pin Min may be a target for the opposition over the ban on personal mobility devices on footpaths last year. The incident led to ""quite a lot” of unhappiness and online discussion, Mr Lim said.

In the Punggol East ward, which the PAP lost in a 2013 by-election but won back in 2015, veteran MP Charles Chong is expected to retire.

It will be a big loss for the PAP if the seven-term MP does not run again, said Mr Lim. 

Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP Teo Ser Luck, whose ward moves to the new Sengkang GRC, is another familiar face to residents and there are rumours that he may also retire from politics, Mr Lim added.

“The PAP may be fielding a combination of an MP from another ward and a new face here as a result, and if there is no heavyweight candidate or current minister to anchor the team, the WP will certainly fancy its chances,” he told CNA.

**CHALLENGES WP COULD FACE**

Another observer, former PAP MP Inderjit Singh, suggested that Sengkang's younger demographic could work in the ruling party's favour.

“PAP will have an upper hand because of the demography of this area – young families who want stability of government,” he suggested.

Still, it would be an “interesting and tough battleground”, he added. “We can expect the PAP to send a strong minister to helm this, so we are likely to see changes on who the candidates will be.""

For one observer, the WP could find it more challenging to form a team for the four-member constituency, compared to the PAP.

“So, while it would seem that it's fair game for all, carving out Sengkang GRC could be seen to be something that the ruling party would necessarily benefit greatly from,” said associate lecturer at SIM Global Education Felix Tan.

He noted, however, that past results show the WP has also been able to make ""significant in-roads"" into the GRC system.

While tackling new areas, the WP will also face the dilemma of investing resources in new wards while working hard to retain Aljunied GRC, said political analyst Mustafa Izzuddin.

“As an experienced political party, the WP knows that they cannot take it for granted Aljunied GRC will be a shoo-in for them. So they will palpably put a lot of effort into making sure to retain Aljunied, an uppermost political priority for them,” he said.

Mr Lim from Vriens & Partners said that the appeal of the WP could have dulled in certain areas. 

He noted that in the 2013 Punggol East by-election, the lack of childcare facilities was cited as one of the reasons for the PAP's loss to Ms Lee Li Lian. 

“Since then, the Government has built more of such infrastructure and integrated the various developments in the area more. The PAP team will point to its track record in this area, making the WP’s goal of winning Sengkang GRC harder,” he said.

The WP would also need to quickly get up to speed and walk the ground in the other half of Sengkang GRC, Mr Lim said.

“That will be made all the harder given the likely campaigning challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak,"" he added.

**OTHER PARTIES MAY JOIN THE FRAY**

While the fight in Sengkang GRC looks set to be between the PAP and WP, observers said that other parties may join the contest. 

In March, after the formation of the new GRC was[ announced by the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/general-election-ebrc-electoral-boundaries-grc-smc-12535200), former Sengkang West MP Dr Lam said:

""As a new GRC, I would expect fierce competition from the opposition parties. But whoever the opposition team may be, we will do our best and let Singaporeans decide based on our track record of service to our fellow citizens."" 

SIM Global Education's Dr Tan said there is always a possibility that there will be other political parties who will enter the fray if they are able to field strong, competent and capable candidates.

“I would not be the least surprised if we have competition from Tan Cheng Bock's Progress Singapore Party (PSP) since it has garnered quite a reputation in recent months. Not only is PSP new, but it can also rest on the Tan Cheng Bock 'cult of personality,'"" he said.

Deputy director of research at the Institute of Policy Studies Gillian Koh said that the new Sengkang GRC may be the subject of a “tussle” between WP and the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA).

This is because the constituency incorporates the current Sengkang West and Punggol East SMCs contested by the WP in 2015, and the SDA contested in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC in the 2015 General Election.

“The boundary change sets up a fight between the two, especially since SDA, in rejecting collaboration with other opposition parties, may not have the resources to expand its reach well beyond the region,” Dr Koh said.

However, others felt that the chances of other parties joining the fight in Sengkang GRC are low. WP should have some ""goodwill"" based on past efforts in this area so other parties may yield to the WP for this GRC, Mr Singh said.

Mr Lim said that while he does not expect major opposition parties like the Singapore Democratic Party to contest there, one of the smaller parties may field a team.

That was the case for last election actually, up until the results were announced people thought it’d be a close fight because it felt like *everyone* was against pap online and offline. It’s only afterwards when people were bemoaning the 70% and reflecting when all the problems with the opposition came to the surface to become the predominant consensus today of GE2015. 

At the end of the day though when a person steps into the privacy of the voting box to make their choice, they may not necessarily go ahead with what they’ve been saying. They may have decided not to voice out that they actually do prefer pap overall to anyone, but reflect it in their vote. 

(It’s kind of how Trump supporters got ridiculed into hiding and you end up with a vast discrepancy between what you thought was the consensus versus the actual result. Not that PAP = Trump, just referring to that phenomena during the 2016 election that idk the name for) 

Ultimately the large (silent) majority of Singaporeans are apathetic politically and don’t want to think too much about it. People will nod and say yeah 377A bad yeah, but then when it comes down to it, it’s simply way too attractive to go for the default option. Especially when the average person cares more about their ricebowls and the economy is going into a recession at the moment... 

Covid19 is such a wild card. It’s simultaneously being played as “so irresponsible to call an election during a pandemic?!” by the opposition, and “we need a mandate to make long-term plans” by PAP. Really up to each side to twist it into an advantage.",t3_hfd708,25-06-2020

IMO lrt system is much more efficient than an all bus system tho. Buses share the same infrastructure as cars etc so if there’s an increase of buses won’t it result in more congestion given how dense the population living in Punggol/Sengkang? Yeah you can argue that there’s such things as bus lane but in Punggol, where it’s mainly 2 roads either way how efficient can that get. 
Personal anecdote there’s a lrt at every 3 stops which takes around 7 min Max to complete a cycle of 3 stops. This means that the waiting time for general commuters are greatly reduced. A bus service from let’s say meridian? 2 stops away by lrt 4 stops by bus. It takes 5 min to reach Punggol mrt while a bus takes 15 min factoring in stops made at each bus stop and the traffic light. Overall I feel that the lrt system has led to an increase in efficiency for general commuter and as oppose to your stand on bus > lrt, I strongly advocate for the inception of lrt system in each heartland islandwide if it is possible. Buses can be used for transporting commuters inter heartlands while lrt can be used intra heartland.

This is an abhorrent act even under normal circumstances. In the present situation, it’s more than mischief. We will be making a police report and will assist in their investigations. We wish to assure the public that the lift has since been cleaned and disinfected. We would like to encourage commuters to not only practise good personal hygiene but also be considerate to others.

As a Gen X/Y Singaporean like most of my friends born in the early 80's, I grew up experiencing the effect of PAP policies on my parents. How parroting the PAPs stance on education, labour etc didn't help them in their lowest during the economic crises. How I actually felt the impact of the last two mortgage and Asian financial crises, and saw what it did to my friends, relatives and neighbours.

In a way I think carving out Sengkang SMC saved the PAP from monumental losses in three GRCs, the same way as they were willing to lose Hougang and Aljunied.

I think the Singaporeans in opposition held districts were pushed over the edge, and they recognise that the issues they face in their own constituencies, at work and at the national level were the result of policies that had either marginalised them or simply missed them as they fell through the cracks.",t3_hp7udo,11-07-2020

> There are of course a myriad of reasons why this result came to be.

> The overall performance of the opposition in GE2020 was much stronger than in 2015, with Workers' Party (WP) gaining a stronger foothold in both Hougang and Aljunied.

> That general performance might suggest a broader inclination for perhaps a varied parliamentary representation.

> Demography is destiny

> But one striking thing about Sengkang GRC could be the demographics itself.

> Sengkang is a new constituency, with many young families.

> All four WP candidates have children under the age of four.

> In an interview with Mothership on Jul 4, the WP Sengkang team hopes that the profile of their own families is a good reflection of Sengkang's ""relatively younger demographic"".

> The Straits Times reported that over 60 per cent of Sengkang's residents are below the age of 45, while over 5 per cent are younger than five years old — figures which are above the national average.

> Issues concerning young Singaporeans

> Given these demographics, the WP team told Mothership that they sought to bring a diversity of experience into Parliament ""in terms of our private sector experience, [and] in terms of our roles as fathers, as sons, and as women"", bringing to the table their experiences as members of the sandwich generation, both Louis Chua and He Tingru said.

> The young team from Sengkang, boasting the youngest candidate (now the youngest member of parliament) at 26 years old, touched upon a thread that perhaps their opponents did not.

> In fact, in her thank you speech after the vote count thanked the young people of Sengkang.

> ""The number of young people who have come out to walk with us, to volunteer, who've actually expressed their interest and hope for a better future for Singapore has really touched me.""

> In WP Sengkang's constituency broadcast, the team touched on issues of young parents, as well as pivoted on their own youth and role as young parents.

> If what these young Singaporeans want is indeed a fair electoral process, and more robust debate, these young people might not take as kindly to things like POFMAs during elections, or unnecessarily harsh press statements against the opposition.

> As with every generation, the definition for what constitutes good governance undoubtedly changes as well, perhaps younger Singaporeans, at the very least in Sengkang, has signalled their willingness to listen to alternative voices.

> A new face in the Workers’ Party is getting people’s attention in Singapore.

> With word on the street swirling around that WP will contest the new Sengkang GRC (group representation constituency) this coming general election, all eyes are on who they might field next.

> Giving a glimpse of potential candidates is Lee Li Lian, WP deputy treasurer and former member of parliament of Punggol East SMC (single member constituency).

> Lee posted Facebook photos on March 16 introducing other party members on their regular walkabout at Sengkang Central, and announcing that WP’s twice-weekly house visits will be thrice-weekly from now on.

> One of the individuals she highlighted was Jamus Lim.

> Who is Jamus Lim?

> The 44-year-old exudes big brain energy, given the trove of information about him online (LinkedIn and CV).

> In short, Lim is an associate professor of economics at ESSEC Business School, and a Raffles Institution alumnus.

> He holds multiple degrees from Harvard University, London School of Economics, University of South Queensland, and University of California, Santa Cruz.

> He was even working in the World Bank where he spent over seven years in the Development Prospects Group in charge of long-term macroeconomic forecasts for the international financial institution.

> This is how stacked his credentials look:

> His personal website suggests he was active online ever since dial-up internet was a thing (circa mid-1990s), and he has eclectic tastes, and is a renaissance man:

> Surprise, surprise: His views were sought on national television, as he previously appeared on CNA in December 2019 giving his take on Singapore’s public sector year-end bonus:

> Lee previously introduced Lim as a new party member in September 2019.

> She mentioned then that he had been walking the ground with WP “for some time”.

> Precious little is known about Lim otherwise, but that could change with the general election fever heating up as he would be called upon to front media interviews.

> What else would Singaporeans like to know about Jamus Lim?

> Talk about Jamus Lim is definitely not new.

> Lianhe Zaobao in December 2019, after putting boots on the ground, ran a gutsy piece on Lim, shedding light on how he might be a prospective candidate.

> Zaobao wrote that WP chief Pritam Singh brought Lim along then as a newcomer during his grassroots visit to Chong Pang City Wet Market & Food Centre.

> The Chinese newspaper also noted the regularity with which WP introduced more white-collared professionals for the last two elections.

> Some of these new candidates graduated from elite universities.

> Zaobao’s report also noted that as per WP’s usual practice, it avoids introducing newcomers before elections, and said Pritam has not introduced Lim formally.

> Zaobao also said Pritam pointed out that WP was not ready to have the newcomer face the media yet.

> The paper also noted that Lim and another new member have continued to conduct their walkabouts around Sengkang constituencies after Lee gave birth.

> Why is Workers’ Party likely to contest Sengkang GRC?

> The four-person Sengkang GRC was cobbled together by merging former Sengkang West and Punggol East SMCs, with parts of Pasir-Ris Punggol GRC slapped onto it for good measure.

> WP contested both Sengkang West and Punggol East SMCs in the last general election, but both constituencies have been wiped off the electoral map.

> In 2015, Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Lam Pin Min won Sengkang West over WP’s Koh Choong Yong with 62.13 per cent of the votes.

> PAP’s Charles Chong narrowly overcame the incumbent Lee with 51.77 per cent of the votes.

> Lee won Punggol East in a 2013 by-election on the WP ticket.

If light gets cut off quickly, it's a star. If it a planet, you will be able to block off only a portion of the light, therefore the light shows a variable brightness as you block it with your thumb.

It supposedly works because a star is infinitely small in the sky, you will never be able to cover half the star with your thumb. A planet is quite large, so you can actually block only half of the light and notice the object dimmer. It's just to identify whether the object is large or not.

Overtime, you will be able to identify planets at a glance. The three brightest planets we usually see are brownish reddish yellow, Venus, Jupiter and Mars. The brightest stars seen with the naked eye through Singapore's light polluted sky, those that people will have trouble determining whether it's a star or planet, are mostly white and blueish.

There  has been some rebuttals against the SMU senior lecturer of statistics,  Dr Wu Zhengxiao's points published in Zaobao by what looks like unaffiliated viewpoints.

The Zaobao forum published this yesterday that noted flaws in Dr Wu's analysis: [https://www.zaobao.com.sg/zopinions/talk/story20200721-1070769](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/zopinions/talk/story20200721-1070769)

And  the Zaobao Op-ed page (paywalled though) had a NUS Prof of Chinese  Studies who asked some searching questions. In it he asked if Dr Wu  actually read the WP Manifesto since it was clear that the calculations  from Dr Wu was not the same as what WP actually presented in the  manifesto and the Dr Wu's calculations did not add up. He asked for more research to be done too:

> Appearing on a Facebook live stream together with the People's Action Party (PAP) team contesting Sengkang GRC, PM Lee gave his views of the Workers' Party manifesto and plans, noting that they were similar to the PAP's:

> ""If you look at the other opposition parties, they all say they want to help workers. I mean they have to say that, but they have no plan to deal with a crisis. And if you look at what is in their manifesto, like the Workers' Party manifesto, Workers' Party is standing in Sengkang. What do they do? They take the PAP's plan, they say 'very good', and here are a few holes, please patch the holes, here are a few places where you can add more money, make it cheaper, do more, work harder. I also can!""

> PM Lee: Show Ng Chee Meng and his team your support

> PM Lee also asked the residents of Sengkang GRC to show the Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Ng Chee Meng their ""full support"":

> ""As Vivian said on the TV debate a few days ago, this is PAP-lite. But I tell you, why do you want to settle for PAP-lite? The real thing is much better. And here in Sengkang, you have the real thing with the four members of our PAP team. And I would ask Sengkang voters very seriously, show Chee Meng and his team their full support. I know the team are ready and raring to go and will give it their all to serve the Sengkang residents well.""

> PM Lee: Ng Chee Meng has led NTUC response to Covid-19

> PM Lee was referring to the political debate on July 1, in which Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan remarked that the Workers' Party manifesto could have been written by the PAP:

> ""And that's why people have called the Workers' Party PAP-lite, or PAP-like. Whatever line or stand PAP has taken, you basically use that as your reference point, and take a half step to the left.""

> Earlier in the chat, PM Lee also gave credit to Ng for leading the NTUC's response in the middle of the crisis, and establishing the NTUC's Job Security Council to match jobs to workers.

> Since February 2020, it has already matched 12,000 jobs, most of them older PMETs working in affected industries.

I also think there is some hypocrisy that a General who has no work experience outside of the force is somehow the Secretary-General of the National Trade Union. This person who has no idea of the working life outside of the army is somehow now in charge of Singapore's workers' union? 

I don't doubt there are competent Generals & that they are probably great people in real life. However, besides having involvement as Minister of Defense, I do not see a need for more high ranking generals/officers to be involved in parliament and being ministers.

Not to mention the practice of the government inserting ex-military generals into positions of power of GLCs without having prior experience in such sectors and running such companies to the ground.

Imagine being in one of these fields, and having someone hired over you as a CEO e.g. in SMRT not because he/she has had more experience in public transit systems but simply because they’re an ex-general who was placed there after his stint in the army. 

This is not to say that they’re incompetent, I’m sure they’re good generals. But you have to ask if they’re the best candidate for the C-suite positions in terms of experience. The answer is most likely no. 

Re: politics especially, I don’t think generals make good politicians in general. The military system which is top-down and hierarchical is just not conducive to proper democratic politics where politicians are meant to serve their people and not vice versa.

3413,19,fz1ttm7,t3_hwtph9,"Sengkang Town Council to take over Punggol East lawsuit: MND

**Source:** Straits Times  
 **Article Date:** 23 Jul 2020   
**Author:** Rei Kurohi  
   

*Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council had originally sued for alleged losses incurred when Punggol East was under WP's watch.*

The new Workers' Party-run Sengkang Town Council (SKTC) will take over the management of a lawsuit initiated by the Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council (PRPTC), the Ministry of National Development (MND) confirmed yesterday.

PRPTC had filed the ongoing civil suit to recover alleged losses incurred by the former Punggol East SMC, which is now part of Sengkang GRC and returned to WP hands at the recent general election.

The transfer of the lawsuit will take effect at the end of this month, when the new town councils are formed following an official declaration by the Minister of National Development, MND added.

This means the WP team in Sengkang will take on the responsibility of handling the lawsuit, which was brought by PRPTC against WP chairman Sylvia Lim, former party chief Low Thia Khiang and six other defendants in the High Court.

MND said: ""As the former Punggol East SMC has become a part of Sengkang GRC, its rights and duties, including the management of the lawsuit initiated by PRPTC, will be handed over to the new town council."" It added that it was unable to comment on specific legal actions or arrangements, which are the prerogative of the respective town councils, as it is not a party to the suit.

It remains to be seen if Senior Counsel Davinder Singh, who has been representing PRPTC in the lawsuit, will continue to represent the new Sengkang Town Council.

The WP and Mr Singh's law firm, Davinder Singh Chambers, did not respond to requests for comment yesterday.

PRPTC's civil suit came after the WP-run Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) had taken the same defendants to court.

Punggol East was managed by AHTC from 2013 to 2015. In GE2015, the People's Action Party won back the single seat. It became part of Sengkang GRC when electoral boundaries were redrawn earlier this year.

PRPTC and the WP town councillors are appealing against a High Court judgment which ruled, among other things, that Ms Lim and Mr Low had breached their fiduciary duties to the town council.

The sums payable to the plaintiffs will be assessed separately.

Assistant Professor of Law Benjamin Ong from the Singapore Management University said SKTC could in theory apply to the court to discontinue the claim entirely.

""However, because the proceedings are at such a late stage, SKTC would require the court's permission to discontinue the suit,"" he said.

""Further, the court would be able to impose conditions on the discontinuance.""

Prof Ong added that even if the court allows the suit to be discontinued, it could still be left open for SKTC to restart proceedings against the defendants later on.

Outlining some possible scenarios, he said SKTC might agree to appoint an independent panel which will be empowered to carry on the litigation on its behalf, and further agree not to interfere with this litigation, similar to what AHTC did.

The Minister for National Development may also have the power to order SKTC to resume proceedings under Section 43D of the Town Councils Act, he said, adding that this is speculation on his part.

""I say it is possible because, as far as I know, Section 43D, which was introduced in 2017, has never been used before, so the precise scope of the minister's powers under Section 43D has yet to be pronounced on authoritatively by the courts.""

Alternatively, it is also possible the minister makes financial grants to SKTC conditional on it resuming proceedings against the defendants or, depending on the timing of the grant, conditional on SKTC not discontinuing the civil suit in the first place, Prof Ong said.",t3_hwtph9,24-07-2020

> PAP, WP line-ups for new Sengkang GRC appear to be taking shape

> The People’s Action Party (PAP) looks set to contest the new Sengkang GRC at the general election with a line-up comprising labour chief Ng Chee Meng, political officeholders Lam Pin Min and Amrin Amin, and lawyer Raymond Lye.

> Party insiders said Mr Amrin is set to be moved from Sembawang GRC to the new four-member group representation constituency (GRC).

> He has been introducing Ms Mariam Jaafar, 43, to residents and grassroots members in his Woodlands ward, fuelling speculation that the Singapore managing director and partner for Boston Consulting Group will take his place in the ward for the upcoming polls.

> On Tuesday, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs and Health posted several photographs on Facebook of himself and Ms Mariam. “She’ll hit the ground running, and do her best to serve residents,” he wrote in his post.

> Mr Amrin declined to comment yesterday when asked if he will be moving to Sengkang GRC.

> In an earlier reply to questions about Ms Mariam and whether he will be leaving Sembawang GRC, Mr Amrin said: “Looks like there are now six of us for a five-person GRC. So someone has to post out I guess.”

> The new Sengkang GRC will have 117,546 voters and consist of the Sengkang Central ward within Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, as well as Punggol East SMC and parts of the single-seat Sengkang West.

> Mr Ng Chee Meng, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, has been tipped to move from Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC to anchor the new GRC. He has been seen in Sengkang on several occasions recently.

> Mr Ng and Mr Amrin will likely replace Mr Teo Ser Luck, whose Sengkang Central ward is estimated to have around 85,000 residents.

> It is unclear if Mr Teo, a threeterm MP, will be fielded elsewhere. He has visited homes in Mr Ng’s Punggol North ward, raising the possibility of a swop with Mr Ng.

> Dr Lam Pin Min, who is Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health, is likely to stay put in Sengkang West, sources said.

> Meanwhile, Mr Lye, 54, a new face and chairman of Punggol East Citizens Consultative Committee, is expected to take over from seventerm party stalwart Charles Chong.

> The Workers’ Party (WP) looks set to make a bid for Sengkang GRC at the next GE, which has to be held by April next year. Both Punggol East and Sengkang West have traditionally been WP stomping grounds.

> At the 2015 General Election, the PAP’s Dr Lam defeated WP opponent Koh Choong Yong in Sengkang West SMC after scoring 62.1 per cent of the vote.

> Over in Punggol East, Mr Charles Chong wrested the single seat from WP incumbent Lee Li Lian with 51.76 per cent of the vote.

> Ms Lee, who previously won the single-member constituency in a by-election in 2013, is expected to lead a WP team to contest Sengkang GRC.

> While the WP has yet to unveil its election plans, Ms Lee has been introducing residents in the area to new faces such as Ms Raeesah Khan, 26, founder of Reyna Movement, which runs programmes to empower women.

> Other potential WP candidates for Sengkang GRC are equity analyst Louis Chua and Essec Business School’s associate professor of economics Jamus Lim, 44.

> While both parties’ line-ups for the GRC seem to be shaping up, there could still be changes come Nomination Day, which must be at least five working days from the date the Writ of Election is issued.

> PHOTO: LAM PIN MIN/FACEBOOK Labour chief Ng Chee Meng (in white) and Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Lam Pin Min, seen here with employees of a shop in Sengkang, look set to be in the PAP team for Sengkang GRC.

> SINGAPORE — Emergency departments at public hospitals in Singapore’s north, east and central areas are generally less busy about 10 months after Sengkang General Hospital, in the north-east, welcomed its first patients.

> The number of cases at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) in Yishun and Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) in Novena dropped slightly after SKH opened in August last year, a Ministry of Health (MOH) spokesperson told TODAY in reply to queries.

> These drops in average patient numbers come despite an overall rise in daily attendances at emergency departments across the public healthcare system, the ministry said.

> While Changi General Hospital (CGH) in Simei recorded an initial 4 per cent dip after the new hospital opened, attendances at its emergency department in April and May returned to levels seen before that, but were still down slightly on average, MOH and CGH said.

> TTSH recorded the biggest fall. Its emergency department saw 396 daily cases on average after SKH opened, compared with 439 previously, said MOH.

> At KTPH, the figure fell from 388 to 371. CGH’s numbers slid from 399 to 389.

> The 1,000-bed SKH, Singapore’s newest public hospital, was officially opened by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in March this year, but service began in August last year.

> MOH’s spokesperson said that SKH has been ramping up its operations since last August.

> On average, its emergency department received about 180 patients daily between August and December last year. This figure rose to 270 or so from January to March.

> MAJOR EMERGENCIES

> Since SKH opened, MOH said that median wait times for major emergencies — known as Priority Level 2 in health terminology — have also improved by four minutes at TTSH and three minutes at KTPH.

> The figure for CGH has stayed “relatively stable”, said MOH’s spokesperson.

> Emergency departments prioritise patients using a system of several levels, based on how serious their conditions are. Major emergencies include limb fractures and persistent vomiting.

> TODAY has asked MOH to provide the actual median wait times for major emergencies at these hospitals.

> SHORTER WAITS

> Some patients told TODAY that they had noticed shorter waits at CGH’s emergency unit in recent months.

> Madam Lim Boon Yau, 62, a bookkeeper, went there in November last year with chest pains.

> There were fewer than 10 patients, she said, and she spent about four hours there.

> By contrast, she waited through the night in March or April last year, when she accompanied her 84-year-old mother to the department after the elderly woman vomited.

> Ms Gemma Daluz, 41, expected a much longer wait when she sought treatment there in February this year, but she left the department in three hours.

> “Before that, a few years back, I came with family, and the wait was a bit longer,” the nurse told TODAY.

> Adjunct Associate Professor Steven Lim, CGH’s chief of accident and emergency (A&E), said that waits at his department depend on factors such as the number of patients and the complexity of cases.

> Staff members attend to potentially life-threatening or medically urgent cases first. “Life-threatening cases are attended to immediately. Patients with less urgent conditions may have to wait longer,” he said.

> Over the past few years, the department has also adjusted its capabilities to cater to the growing needs of elderly patients.

> These include clinical protocols established with Saint Andrew’s Community Hospital, where CGH’s A&E department identifies suitable patients to be admitted direct to the community hospital.

> “From the patient’s perspective, this reduces handovers between different departments before admission to Saint Andrew’s Community Hospital, while enabling sicker patients to get beds earlier in the acute hospital (CGH),” said Adjunct Assoc Prof Lim.

> The MOH advised the public to seek medical treatment at emergency departments only for serious, urgent and life-threatening emergencies.

> “For common and minor medical problems, the first place for medical help remains the family physicians in the neighbourhood,” the ministry’s spokesperson said.

3576,19,fwxkrja,t3_hl2w9k,"what sk residents refer to as overcrowding is the high density of people. you can experience it on the mrt platform, and especially the LRT platform from morning till night. sk is visually overcrowded; hdb flats of the same height (and i mean it) are built closely next to each other. in fact, sk has one of the highest no of hdb dwelling units as compared to other estates. 

ponggol doesnt fare much better. so its a real concern for sk residents to know that sk and ponggol are able to accomodate more people, and u know how squeezy a train ride csn be. prior to covid, if a commuter travels to ponggol from town, the train is almost packed to the brim, for most the journey as most people alight at sk and ponggol. 

by building more parks and adding more greens, yes the envt becomes more liveable, but not if u add more bto flats & people. ncm does not understand clearly what it feels like to live in sk, when ure just tired of seeing so many people everywhere. i dont expect the oppo party to understand this either. but i feel that if the same issue is highlighted to them, they would probably react with more empathy. the display of empathy can sway the opinion of voters.",t3_hl2w9k,04-07-2020

Stop building anymore in Sengkang and move new BTOs to other estates? Chase people away? The fact is, he can never make such huge promises immediately anyway, it requires a lot of coordination between all the different govt planning agencies. The only politically appropriate answer would be to build more amenities for everyone to share, which is within his control.",t3_hl2w9k,05-07-2020
3580,19,fwwoibx,t1_fwwexzx,"No. The issue is that he didn't answer the question directly. Amenities are nice, but don't directly solve the problem. Overcrowding is an problem. Going to work in the morning, coming home at night, these are things people have to worry about. With COVID-19, that's even more of an issue. 

Is there a viable plan for transportation around Singapore from Sengkang? There is only 1 MRT in the vicinity and it's crowded everyday. It's a pain trying to navigate the bus routes.  Increasing the population density in Sengkang would only make it worse. How does having more parks and playgrounds help them? Say you want to watch a movie, you'll have to travel to Seletar or Punggol instead. Meanwhile Tampines has 3 malls and a Tampines hub within a 3km radius. 

Having a new town council to better understand the people sounds nice in theory but it begs the question, if you were served by 2 town council and they didn't meet your needs the last 5 years, what makes you think it'll be different this time round?",t3_hl2w9k,04-07-2020

I would like to point out that he was right on mitigating the effects of overcrowding. However, what is the main concern of the populous when it comes to the town being too crowded ? Are parks and greenery the top concern of the people ?

You definitely don't stay there. Buangkok MRT is also in Sengkang GRC too. A fair point to make would be that there is only one mrt line serving Sengkang GRC. And if you stay there, you would or ought to know that Punggol station will. Be interchange for new MRT lines. This will provide easy access to Sengkang GRC too.

And transport issues are national ones and beyond what Sengkang GRC team cam do. Be that as it may, national transport plans on new lines until 2040 have been published since NOV 2019.",t3_hl2w9k,04-07-2020

Instead of the train making its usual start at Punggol, it will skip Punggol and start from Sengkang/Buangkok instead, and that will actually shorten the train intervals at subsequent stations as well.  

If I want to take that stupid interchange to the east, wouldn’t it be easier to just take 27 ?

Let me try to get the point across. The concern the residents have is overcrowding. The answer did not address overcrowding. Adding more amenities does not alleviate overcrowding. It may improve quality of life, but it doesn't address the core problem. 

As you said, one obvious solution is to move people out. That is clearly not viable.

 A less effective, but at least equally reassuring statement would be that they will no longer build new flats in the region to reduce strain on existing space. They've in fact announced the opposite.

A third strategy (one that u/asdfmaster is proposing) is to increase crowding related facilities, such as additional bus routes, more mrts etc. Again, they didn't say that. Their statement to increase playgrounds and fitness zones actually reduce the available space, making it seems more crowded.

The problem isn't that they're not doing anything. The problem is that what they're doing doesn't solve the problem and seems to make it worse, which suggest that they're either not listening, or they just don't care.",t3_hl2w9k,04-07-2020

Such public-private partnerships can yield good results too. The people who buy these homes are people who can afford to purchase private properties anyway. It is not as if the homes ontop of this area are going to be owned by HDB dwellers.

Anyway, the trend in SG is fairly similiar to HK whereby prime plots of land around MRT are always sold to private developers who can better build better facilities and amenities around the area.

But Buangkok does not even have a bus interchange now..... only a few buses passes by that area. Unless there are significant development, this seems pretty much like another small mall.

Of course, there will be people supporting Raesaah because she is WP too. That's a given, some people vote for the party and not for the candidate.

NCM is the first CDF to join politics, If he can lead SAF no doubt that he can lead the GRC and solve residents problems. He dangled a big carrot too by saying that he can help with job loss as Sec gen of Ntuc. 

All I want to say is It really boils down to what SK voters is concern about. NCM and his team is not a bad choice and it's very reasonable to vote for Jamus too if they want an alternate voice in parliament. 

I'm quite surprised they haven't dig out NCM past yet.",t3_hloc47,05-07-2020
