Let’s just disregard ethics, morals and environmentalism for a second. Even then, from a pure economic perspective, do you really think the current wealth distribution is fine? 

Yes, it is a difficult issue to solve but the first step is to admit there’s a problem.",t3_bqelen,19-05-2019
96,3,eo463o6,t1_eo44r6u,"It's fine. I'm no economics pro but heres my understanding. There are two main groups of people who are against wealth inequality. One absolutely despises filthy rich people (anti-rich prejudice) due to jealousy and thinks they are gaudy and got up there through shady means etc. The other group feels that as long as someone out there is still dirt poor and suffering they should not be holding onto so much wealth. 

I find that most people belong to the first group, pretty evident when they just attack anyone with wealth and talk about how their super cars are tacky and how fucked up rich people are etc. 

I believe that wealth inequality is a problem. But is it a problem that only the ultra rich should bear? Why not the middle class as well? Like how the critics say the rich does not need a 100m super yacht I'd say the middle class does not need their soy latte from star bucks. Clearly the responsibility lies with society to contribute towards solving the problem. 

My original comment is simply structured to be slightly aggravating but also as a spark for one to reflect if it even makes sense to shit on the ultra rich for buying nice things when the average guy also consumes products for personal pleasure when it's seen as a luxury to the marginalized as well.",t3_bqelen,19-05-2019
97,3,eo47x22,t1_eo463o6,"That was really insightful. Theoretically, I think you are right, the middle class should bear responsibility in wealth redistribution too. However, I think if you include the “human” factor, you can’t expect the average middle class person to give up drinking his soy latte thinking it will help the cause. It’s like game theory, he probably thinks him helping will end up being capitalized by some unethical opportunist. 

I believe the process of change can only start from the top. When the ultra rich takes the initiative to redistribute wealth, eventually, it will trickle down and people will follow suit be it due to a common mechanism of wealth redistribution being created or simply people following suit. 

wealth redistribution obviously shouldn’t just be donations or higher taxes that may be misused by shit governments, but fundamentally should be used directly to improve externalities that benefit the poverished like education, infrastructure, research, healthcare****)",t3_bqelen,19-05-2019
98,3,eo48sui,t1_eo47x22,"The middle class definitely needs to play a part. I get what you're saying when it comes to the game theory but I don't think it's an excuse. We don't point at a guy driving a mercedes and go why are you spending 6 figures on a luxury item when you could have paid for xx amount of African kids health care for yy years. Why do only do that when we see news about the ultra rich? the truth is both the rich, ultra rich and even the middle class are spending on things for personal satisfaction when it could have went towards helping the impoverished. 

Anti-rich prejudice as seen here that sparked from the post and my comment is inexcusable. The fact that these guys have reddit and can meme and post about first world problems and have the time to hate on the rich shows that there's a lot more they can be doing or ""sacrificing"" to help the poor before pointing their fingers at the top of the chain. 

The change should come from the top, but even beyond that, it should come from the system. There's a lot of money out there being poured into wrong foundations that do not go towards direct funding of the poor. But then again, this is getting out of my scope and getting far too long for a reddit comment. 

Tl;Dr stop the anti-rich prejudice. middle class is considered rich as well relative to the poor. If you think the ultra rich shouldn't buy a yacht when poor people still exist, then I don't think one should be enjoying any luxuries when every cent goes a long way in helping an impoverish individual's quality of life. 

I'm not doing the best I can to help the poor, but the least I could do is not be a hypocrite and hang someone else for sins I'm liable for as well.",t3_bqelen,19-05-2019

Motor Yacht A (MY A) is a luxury motor yacht designed by Philippe Starck and engineered by naval architect Martin Francis. It was built by the Blohm + Voss shipyard at the HDW deepwater facility in Kiel. It was ordered in November 2004, and delivered in 2008 at a rumoured cost of US$300 million. With a length of 119 metres (390 ft) and displacing almost 6,000 tonnes, it is one of the largest motor yachts in the world.

> By Anshuman Daga

> SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's Temasek Holdings is terminating its $3 billion conditional offer for conglomerate Keppel Corp <KPLM.SI> by invoking a material adverse change (MAC) clause following the company's poor financial results.

> Keppel's large second-quarter loss that breached a threshold in the state investor's offer to buy control of the company had raised the risk Temasek would abandon the deal.

> ""The offeror has decided that it will invoke the MAC pre-condition, and accordingly, is announcing today that the partial offer will not proceed,"" a Temasek subsidiary said in a Singapore bourse statement on Monday, a public holiday.

> Its decision is still likely to surprise markets as expectations had mounted Temasek would lead much-needed consolidation in the rig-building sector after taking majority control of Keppel.

> The domestic rig-building sector has been battered by a long period of low oil prices exacerbated by the coronavirus crisis.

> Anticipation of a deal strengthened in June, when Temasek backed a S$2.1 billion rights issue by Sembcorp Marine <SCMN.SI>, Keppel's smaller competitor.

> ""The withdrawal will put a spanner in the works - it was widely expected that there would be some alliance between Keppel's marine business and Sembcorp Marine with Temasek being the largest mutual shareholder,"" Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners, said.

> Last October, Temasek offered to increase its one-fifth stake in Keppel to 51%.

> Keppel, whose businesses range from property development to rig-building, sank into a net loss of S$697 million ($507 million) for April to June, from a net profit of S$153 million a year earlier - its biggest quarterly loss in at least 15 years, Refinitiv data showed.

> Keppel shares ended last week at S$5.40, down 20% this year, below Keppel's offer price of S$7.35.

> SINGAPORE: Issues surrounding the Keppel Offshore & Marine corruption probe, as well as the misuse of e-scooters will be on the agenda when Parliament sits on Monday (Jan 8).

> On Dec 23, news broke that [Keppel O&M had paid US$422 million (S$560 million) in fines](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/keppel-o-m-to-pay-us-422m-in-fines-as-part-of-settlement-over-9522200) as part of a global resolution reached with criminal authorities in the United States, Brazil and Singapore over [corrupt payments made by a former agent in Brazil](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/keppel-acknowledges-suspicious-transactions-linked-to-agent-in-b-7730272). It was also issued a conditional warning by Singapore&apos;s Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), the conglomerate said in its news release then.

> According to the Parliament order paper released on Friday (Jan 5), three questions on the Keppel O&M probe have been tabled.

> Workers&apos; Party Member of Parliament (MP) Pritam Singh has asked when the Government expects the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB)  and the Attorney-General&apos;s Chambers to formally complete investigations, and if there is any agreement that prevents the disclosure of the identities of the Singaporeans involved. 

> Meanwhile, MP Sylvia Lim asked if the fines paid were part of a three-nation plea bargain agreement involving the US, Brazil and Singapore, and if it was indeed so, what are the considerations involved in reaching such agreements.

> MP Png Eng Huat on his part asked how far back will CPIB will go in its investigations seeing as the corrupt practices date back to 2001.

> Other issues on the agenda include the recent spate of e-scooter [accidents](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/rider-injured-at-woodlands-in-second-e-scooter-accident-of-the-9455680) and [misconduct](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/man-caught-illegally-riding-e-scooter-along-pie-9441768). Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan has been asked if measures will be taken to tackle the unsafe usage of e-scooters on roads and expressways. More specifically, issues pertaining to the compensation for pedestrians involved in e-scooters have also been raised.

> Following the [train collision](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/joo-koon-train-collision-total-number-of-injured-rises-to-38-9420752) that occurred at Joo Koon MRT station on Nov 15 last year, MP Lim Wee Kiak has asked for an update on the transport ministry&apos;s [investigations into the incident](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/joo-koon-train-collision-no-human-error-involved-smrt-says-9426276) and what steps will be taken to [prevent similar accidents](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/joo-koon-train-collision-signalling-system-provider-thales-could-9425970) in future.

> Non-Constituency MP Dennis Tan has also asked if the relevant SMRT personnel were aware that the first train involved in the collision had malfunctioned and if there had been any way to prevent the accident from taking place. 

> Elsewhere, four MPs posed questions on the recent [scams involving](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/man-jailed-5-weeks-for-fake-wage-credit-claims-9374414) government schemes such as SkillsFuture and the Wage Credit Scheme.
