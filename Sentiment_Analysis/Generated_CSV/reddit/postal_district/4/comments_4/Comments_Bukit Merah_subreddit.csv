157,3,fmrw5wt,t3_fx1c1k,"I live nearby. I mentioned it in one of my previous post a few days ago. 

Honestly, I’m glad they’re doing this because we know that special times call for special needs. We also know that these blocks were going to be torn down and were kind of sad cos they’re an icon of the neighbourhood but efforts to save them went unheard. So it’s kind of nice that these blocks can have a final lease of life before they’re gone. 

As a nearby resident, my worry was that if they bring the virus over from the dorms, it’s too close to home. At the very least there needs to be a proper barrier from the residential communities (I know, this sounds like putting them in jail but hear me out). These blocks are right next to elderly rental flats, home of the most vulnerable group of people in this COVID crisis. It’s also right next to Redhill market, where many elderly come from other neighborhoods even to do their daily grocery shopping. It’s also literally 3 minutes away from the MRT station. My worry is that if they don’t follow the rules of lockdown, spreading the virus around the neighbourhood would have dire consequences given the average aged population here. 

Which is why I’m glad to see that the authorities have set up a barricade around the blocks so that the entry and exit points are limited and more importantly, controlled. It’s not ideal but it’s a compromise I think we all have to accept in special times like these. From what I understand, They are still able to come out of the residences to make essential purchases so they are not say utter lack of freedom like a convict. They have to follow lockdown rules like the rest of us so we are as much a convict in our own homes as they are.

So ya, to address some of your concerns (specifically the downvotes guy who talked about property prices and deleted his comment while I was typing reply to him so I’m reposting this as a parent comment instead), most residents here are understanding enough to know whats going on and we applaud this measure taken. We know it’s only short term, and we care less about property prices and more about the virus spreading as new elements are introduced in the neighbourhood and we don’t know for sure how things will play out. 

Ps: they’ve been working on this for weeks now, so please do give the govt some credit here. They did not as some have claimed, do nothing for the dorm workers, but instead have been working quietly in the background until things are up and and running before they announce it. I can assure you first hand based on the massive effort and how long they took to refit the place, that **they’ve been working on this waaaaayyy before the recent clusters at the dorms broke out (less the initial cluster at S11 at Seletar).** In fact, they’ve only moved in two days ago to the first few flats which are ready, they’re still working on the other blocks in the precinct at this very moment.

> SINGAPORE - Some 21 vacant Housing Board blocks in Bukit Merah are being refurbished to house healthy foreign workers working in essential services, the Ministry of National Development (MND) has said.

> The workers will start to move into the three-room flats progressively as works are completed in the coming weeks.

> MND said in response to queries from The Straits Times on Wednesday (April 8) that the affected blocks had earlier undergone the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, which buys back from residents public housing sitting on land with high redevelopment potential for other purposes.

> The flats were vacated in 2018 but not yet demolished.

> With foreign dormitories becoming a source of concern for the spread of the coronavirus in recent days, an inter-agency task force has been set up to, among other things, ensure that any disruption to essential services is minimised by having workers in these industries housed separately.

> The foreign workers who are expected to move into the Redhill Close flats work in areas such as cleaning and maintenance.

> In a notice to residents in the area on Monday, Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sam Tan said that the dormitories of the workers slated to move in have not been spared from Covid-19.

> Housing them separately will ""keep them safe from the disease, which will in turn keep us safe when they are working in our midst"", said Mr Tan, who is also Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.

> He also assured residents that just like the rest of Singapore during the ""circuit breaker"" measures, which began on Tuesday, the workers will remain in their flats except to travel to work using company transport or to buy essentials.

> Police and Certis officers will be deployed to maintain order at these blocks.

> ""Let's show our support to these workers by welcoming them during this difficult period,"" he added.

> The Straits Times has contacted MND for more information.

While observing from the surface, one might note that it is rather easy to reverse this trend by making a more informed decision.

Many of these users are elderly or young children who might not have access to the internet to check where they can go to now.

All that primarily because of the NLB’s project to house libraries at malls, not because there’s a need for BMRL to undergo a facelift. It’s trying to fix something that isn’t broken. 

Honestly, I won’t be so mad if the new library is just a stone’s throw away. Or at the recently renovated Tiong Bahru plaza either. But it is shifting to a location much further out with almost no residents in the vicinity. Remember, the library is still primarily supposed to serve the same residents that they targeted when back in BM. Some had to travel one or two bus stop, some come in from the next town over, some just walk down to the next building or two. Now, _everyone_ has to take some type of transport just to get to the library. Books are not light you know.

Yes, you can have little in terms of material to offer to your kids, but the least you can do is to show them love and give them a proper family.",t3_bml8b0,09-05-2019

It is a collection of essays written by Prof. Teo You Yenn, with observations drawn from 3 years of research & fieldwork. It’s filled with valuable insights & does quite the job of making you painfully aware of the vast inequalities faced by people in SG. Definitely worth a read!",t3_bml8b0,10-05-2019

324,3,emxjluh,t1_emxf6ci,Totally agree. We're actually quite fortunate if we don't have to worry much about our next meal.,t3_bml8b0,09-05-2019
325,3,emzzgpt,t1_emzarfz,"Yeah the easy thing is to say 'have fewer kids' but it can quickly become very problematic.

How many kids is too many? Where do we draw the line? Should we be controlling women's bodies? If yes, how do we implement that? Do poor people make bad decisions or are they poor because they make bad decisions?

Also, some religions reject the use of contraception. Singapore's population is already low as it is, it is unlikely that the govt will implement another 'stop at two'.

But saying they deserve the situation they are in because of their 'poor' decisions is not constructive. It doesn't resolve the existing situation. People who wanna have kids will still have kids, whether they can afford it or not. I don't have an easy answer to the problem of poverty but I doubt anyone really has. Luckily for Singapore, these cases have become a minority over the years unlike in less developed countries where they are much more prevalent.",t3_bml8b0,10-05-2019

327,3,en16er6,t1_emzzgpt,"Don't have kids if you can't afford to give them what they deserve.  

Having kids ain't some stupid thing to check off a list and just because some people want to have kids doesn't mean they deserve to have them.",t3_bml8b0,10-05-2019
328,3,en14cfc,t1_emzzgpt,"The government has been very willing and able to insert itself into the intimate aspects of citizens lives including family planning. Social engineering has been the norm so it's not that much of a stretch to suggest that we should try to influence the number of children being born by those who can't afford it. We already hand out incentives to boost birth rates, perhaps we ought to use targeted disincentives like additional taxes to discourage having more kids when you clearly can't afford it. Having a large population that is trapped in the cycle of poverty without quality education, family structure and unable to find employment would be a far greater drain on the economy than our current population woes. 

Identifying poor decisions is constructive if we then try to figure out how to correct them.",t3_bml8b0,10-05-2019
