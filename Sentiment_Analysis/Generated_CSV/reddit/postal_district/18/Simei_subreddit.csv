Tourist here looking for a place(*preferably near Simei*) with a reliable internet connection, to take a work related video call(30-60 minutes). Ideally would love a closed sound-proof room, but if that isn't available, I could do a cafe or a co-working space. 

Would love any recommendation from y'all. Did a quick google search and [found this](https://medium.com/@teoyusiang/work-friendly-cafes-in-singapore-you-can-really-get-work-done-in-f3f51b01b7e6), but I'd really like a local recommendation. 

TIA!"
