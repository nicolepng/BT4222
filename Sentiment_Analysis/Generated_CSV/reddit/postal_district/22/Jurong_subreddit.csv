And RDU ones are much smaller and harder to read (probably because of budgetary reasons?). Just crossed paths with the likely new MP for Jurong Spring Shawn, didn't say much other than to wish him good luck. 

Still on the fence on whether or not RDU is worth a sympathy vote from a first time voter. Read their manifesto and found it ok, learnt about Michelle Lee and have some respect for her chosen path. The only thing I am not sure about is their proposal for mandatory en bloc.

Not everyone wants it, and it could be too costly.  Does anyone in jurong GRC have additional thoughts about the election here?"
