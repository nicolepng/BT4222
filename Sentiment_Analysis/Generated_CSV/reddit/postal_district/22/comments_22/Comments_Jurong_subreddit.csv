* Buying the 25c soft serve and the original Chicken McCrispy at McDonald's
* Opening a Pokemon Neo Destiny booster pack from Comics Connection to find a Shining Mewtwo
* Buying Tamiya motors at Kiddy Palace (Plasma Dash and Hyper Dash 2 represent)
* Blowing years of pocket money savings on an Xbox 360 from Comics Connection on launch day, first time I had ever spent >$50 on something
* Getting hyped for the opening of Carl's Jr because the only other outlet was at Vivo at the time
* Walking by 77th Street at different stages of youth and thinking their clothes were cheesy -> super cool -> cheesy again

So basically, Jurong Point never really change much other then expension and changing retail. It's not like IMM, Causeway Point and Northpoint City where it literally change everything inside. I'm glad JP didn't.

There was a front entrance facing Boon Lay Way, before they sealed it up. Walk through JP towards the bus interchange, completely non-aircon, open-air (i.e. the bus interchange was non-aircon)

IIRC, the arcade was still called Wywy Wonderspace.

Then HDB started developing the land at Jurong West Central there. At that time just next to the bus-stop, there was a construction hoarding and a cafeteria serving the workers. While waiting for the bus, we kids will walk across the grass patch up to the hoarding and ask the auntie for milo/curry puffs.

Then early 2000s came, I was posted to a nearby army camp and the first JP upgrade was completed. JP and Lot 1 was a frequent nights-off destination with army buddies.

I watched Titanic there too and remembered going straight to Popular CDrama and buying the soundtrack right after the movie.

Oh man, don't get me started on Hiroyuki Sanada.

I've been a HUGE fan since the 80's when he was billed as ""Henry"" Sanada alongside his [mentor](https://youtu.be/ztedCMMl68I?t=28) Shinichi ""Sonny"" Chiba in such baddass action movies like [*Roaring Fire*](https://youtu.be/-nDKhmlegUE?t=336) .

By the time he was cast in the Tom Cruise vehicle *The Last Samurai*, Sanada was already an accomplished (the first Japanese to perform with the RSC) and critically acclaimed actor, esp after his performance in *The Twilight Samurai* two years earlier.

In fact I have this *wild* theory that Sanada was supposed to be originally cast as Katsumoto, but Tom Cruise grew worried about getting upstaged & out-acted by him (heck they even physically resembled each other) and eventually got the producers to replace him with then unknown Ken Watanabe instead.

Wait, where was I? 😂

Oh yeah *Sunshine*. 

I'm actually fine with the last half of the movie, because its ongoing themes were always about the frailty of the human condition, and the hubris and arrogance that undermine our best attempts at changing our fate. And of course there's that age-old Science vs Faith conundrum. 

So having a human antagonist served the themes better than anything supernatural or extraterrestrial. 

As to *why* the antagonist looked the way he did, I think of it as Danny Boyle's way of illustrating to the audience the effect that the Sun's (the *other* antagonist) massive gravity was having on the crew's psychological state ie they might actually have been hallucinating some aspects of his physical appearance.",t3_gjs0ou,18-05-2020

Yeah maybe the it was hallucination, but a burnt out villain with unusual strength killing a space crew is too close to Event Horizon. Haven’t watched the movie in years so I might remember things incorrectly. Last point to add before I got off riding Sunshine’s dick is the perfect score matching with the scene, Adagio in D Minor while they were racing to repair the shield. It was epic and beautiful and sad.",t3_gjs0ou,18-05-2020
426,22,fr935i9,t1_fr2ccee,"So I ended up watching my Sunshine Blu-ray for the umpteenth time yesterday evening.

And it STILL holds up... the brilliant ensemble cast (Chris Evans showed serious acting chops, so glad he's finally out of those silly superhero CGI fests), the relentless pacing, the phenomenal music as you pointed out, and that ending scene with Capa ""touching"" the Sun is still among the most powerful images I've ever seen on film.

You know Boyle actually inserted subliminal images of Pinbacker right in the opening minutes of the movie when Searle was staring into the Sun. And of course Searle's increasingly obsessive behaviour showing the onset of the same Heliomania ^((I just made that word up))  that had consumed Pinbacker earlier.  
So by the time we actually get to see Pinbacker his appearance didn't really seem that bizarre to me.

590,22,fxogr7h,t1_fxoevue,"People have been calling for Tharman to be PM for awhile now. He's consistently done excellently at every election he's run in, in some years polling at over 80%, and people like him in general.

CCS was the frontrunner for the PM job after LHL hangs it up, but as you know he hasn't held himself very well in the past year or so and HSK is now very clearly slated to take the job when the time comes. HSK, the same guy who said that Singapore isn't ready for a minority prime minister.

Think about how much pride you have to put aside for your own colleague to make some sweeping racist (and largely unprovable) statement just so he can step over you to take the job that you could probably do better. 

Of course someone will eventually point out that Tharman himself has stated that he isn't interested in the PM job but you never know if that's exactly what it is or if it's regular PAP shenanigans keeping a united front as usual.",t3_hp6jy1,11-07-2020

1. They didn't want to fight in 3 corner fights so they got Tharman. 
2. They were a new party so they didn't have a chance to touch base on the ground. 
3. They were a small party, contesting only 1 GRC with 5 candidates so they didn't get the airtime that the others got. Besides the constituency broadcast and the NUS forum, I don't think they had a chance to talk in front of the people. They didn't even get a chance for a closing statement on cooling day missing the criteria by 1 member. 

They could have gotten a better chance if Ivan had contested in Jurong but hopefully they can continue to do the work and have a better showing next elections.",t3_hp6jy1,11-07-2020

595,22,fxot0x5,t1_fxoohn3,"Hmm thanks for the info. Actually I saw the broadcast requirements for 6 candidates and my first question was.... ""What about those parties that have under 6 candidates?""

I see... So RDU was one of them. The reason why I felt that RDU was one of the parties with likely the lowest % of votes, and likely to lose deposits is because they rarely appeared on TV, and no one in the party was especially outstanding. 

I went to look out for their background, and saw 2 were from PSP, but like most of the members from PSP, the 2 were little known.

I'm surprised at the % of RDU well knowing that some might have voted for RDU due to pity votes, not wanting them to lose their deposits, due to anger at PAP etc. But the one at Jurong GRC is Tharman, arguably the second most popular Minister now, after PM Lee.

So even if Ivan is in, there's no way Tharman would have lost Jurong GRC. Heck, even if he was hard carrying 4 Ivans, I don't think he would have lost. That's because no matter what, having one Tharman with PAP's backing is arguably better than having RDU (which is opposition) to care for the constituency.

So yea, good job RDU! It's pretty spectacular and very courageous for them to take on Jurong GRC. Hope they have a good future ahead of them.",t3_hp6jy1,11-07-2020
596,22,fxou190,t1_fxot0x5,I don’t think Ivan would have made that big of a difference if he had ran. But it would help in the figures at least. Instead of 25% maybe rdu gets 30?,t3_hp6jy1,11-07-2020

From what I observed, today's incident was well handled from a engineering perspective. Move trains so that they idle at stations with doors open, and quickly evacuate trains that have stalled.


Communications leaves much to be desired. At Bishan, there was no staff at the platform. Nobody knew what was going on. The station was half lit, and escalators were all turned off.


The train indicated it would end at Marina Bay, but the platform display indicated Paya Lebar. In train announcements were hard to make out, and it was impossible to tell if he said 15 mins delay or 50 mins delay. Also, clearly an engineer was speaking as he used terms such as ""traction current"". 
I know what traction current is, but how many passengers do you think do? There's a reason official SMRT comms use the term ""power failure"".


Finally, in train announcements were very different from the one SMRT posted on their twitter feed. Communications from OCC indicated a 15/50? mins delay while SMRT comms indicated no train service. This wasn't a one time thing, with OCC announcing that traction current was restored while SMRT twitter was still posting no train service.


There are certain things that SMRT did right; clearly they learnt from previous incidents that it is important not to leave passengers stuck on the train, and today showcased a drastic change in their operating procedures.
I also appreciated the constant updates from OCC, but it was almost inaudible. Finally, I understand the fact that the NSEWL went down first, and that staff from the CCL might have been redeployed and it was extremely unfortunate that the CCL went down later, but the mood at Bishan CCL basically nobody knew what was going on. The only consolation was that someone was taking to us every 10-15 mins over the PA.


Anyway, I don't want to give off the wrong impression. I'm, not blaming SMRT or anything, I understand that rail services have lots of moving parts, and things do go wrong. I understand the fact that SMRT could have negated multiple failures or incidents due to proper planning and procedures, and we will never know about the work they did in those instances. The idea is that I hope they gained some learning points from this incident, like they did in the last major disruption.


Finally, I'm not hating on the engineer or anything. I understand that that was a stressful time, and tbh, hearing any voice is really really appreciated when you're stuck on a train as you know they still remember about you.

Remember, cars are only expensive because of COE and the fuel and road taxes they added on to it. They can easily make cars cheap if they want. All you need to do is to remove all taxes from cars, and increase public transport pricing by 100x, and suddenly the MRT is a luxury and cars are basic necessities.

In a sense, yes. As much as we would like to believe otherwise, access to potable water is a luxury for many who simply do not have access to it. That said, this is assuming you aren't arguing in bad faith by using the word 'luxury' to describe a necessity as opposed to a convenience.

Oh, they definitely know. Also, why do you keep claiming this?

&#x200B;

>Because that's the definition of a luxury right?

What you are describing are necessities that, despite what their name implies, are not always readily available. To many living in undeveloped countries, easy access to potable water from the tap may very well be a luxury if they've had to travel 4km daily to get a bucket of water.

Yes, access to potable water should be a given since it's a necessity. Some would go so far as to call it a basic human right (another topic for another day).

Unless you are using the term ""luxury"" in bad faith, by describing something  that is not readily available as a ""luxury"", which means you are logically impaired as well.

If that's your argument, why bother? Everything can be a luxury, even oxygen. Sure as hell cars can be a luxury, you just need to make it so expensive that no one can afford, as you can do with water, oxygen, medicines, shelter etc. Having arms and legs can be a luxury too. Why even bother to make this argument then, if everything in life is a luxury? If having cars is as much of a luxury as having legs and potable water, then you need to start questioning what luxury means to you.

You on the other hand cannot even answer a simple question I have posted, nor the 2 points that I have made simply for you to see. Please tell me one thing on this planet that is not a luxury to you? You can't even name one. 

Try addressing my points head on like I did for yours. It's already quite clear you are just some random incel idiot pounding away at your keyboard at home.

As a prospective candidate until he stepped aside shortly before Nomination Day, he had worked very hard on the ground - as I mentioned in my opening speech. He is naturally not part of the team of MPs. But I wanted to acknowledge the contribution he had made, and have him add his own thanks to residents in addition to those of the five MPs.

this. 

i know land is scarce in Singapore, but it's almost as if in the pursuit of land optimisation, basic comforts and sheer common sense don't matter anymore. 

We all know how noise and air pollution have a significant impact on mental and physical health. and yet, none of these seem to factor into urban planning these days. not to mention the ever-shrinking flat sizes - something that the government still denies.

Punggol and Tengah for example shouldn't have been developed into housing estates, IMHO, due to their proximity to air bases and JB's industrial areas. And yet they're being touted as the next attractive 'place to be'. 

No choice? Ok I buy the argument. But don't pretend like it's all rosy. At least acknowledge the issue and initiate mitigating  counter-measures.

1401,22,fc2dpyj,t1_fc2av46,"My best guess is probably an artefact of diffraction where the shutter when it’s open cause light to bend slightly off course near the edge of the shutter. This is especially cool to me cause I can infer how the shutter looks like (similar shape to the actual glare).

You can see a similar phenomenon with satellite pictures of stars and why they have this diamond shape glare (as you know, stars aren’t actually diamond shape).

Edit: On further research it could just be Lens flare.",t3_efrlu4,26-12-2019
1402,22,fc4zl67,t1_fc2av46,"https://kenrockwell.com/tech/sunstars.htm

What you are seeing are actually the result of aperture blades at a smaller F stop. Think of F stops as your iris. F/1.8 means your iris is wide open, therefore it lets in more light and is a large and faster F stop. F/25 is when the 'iris' is smaller, therefore lets in less light and is a smaller and slower F stop than F/1.8.

[This is my photo that I took during the eclipse.](https://i.imgur.com/oxpkHB2.jpg)  Photo was taken on a Nikon D7100 using a 70-210mm F/4-5.6 @ 210mm, 1/8000 of a second and at F/25. My lens has seven bladed diaphragm, therefore if I shoot at very bright objects at smaller F stops, I will see 14 sunstar rays.

/u/Clams1104 is right about the diffraction. Here is a wiki link about it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_spike",t3_efrlu4,27-12-2019

In my two cents' opinion, the shot would look even better if the shot was taken closer to the flats as the grass seems to be taking up a lot of the space in the shot and distracting from the focus point.

Qu Yuan, who was then a minister of his home state, advocated reform to his state of Chu, which angered the King. The King continually refused to listen to Qu Yuan's advice and instead banished him from the state of Chu. In exile, Qu Yuan wrote poetry expressing his concern for his country and people. In 278 B.C., when Qu Yuan heard that his home had been invaded, he committed suicide by drowning himself in the famous Ni Lo River. 

The people of Chu rushed to the river to rescue their beloved minister. Too late to save Qu Yuan, they splashed furiously and threw steamed rice wrapped in reed leaf into the river as a sacrifice to his spirit and to keep the fish from consuming Qu Yuan's body.

Since that time more than 2000 years ago, it has been customary during the dumpling festival to enjoy rice dumplings as a memorial to this patriotic poet. ",t3_hgvisl,28-06-2020

Many of the large waterbirds in open-air enclosures at the Bird Park, such as various pelicans, cranes, storks, flamingos, and swans, undergo pinioning, a procedure in which one of the wing joints is amputated, analogous to chopping off someone's hand at the wrist. Which is why if you look at some of the captive pelicans and flamingos, their wings are obviously of unequal length. It's an unpleasant, probably painful process, but you only need to do it once when the bird is still young, and you don't need to worry about it ever flying away. Found [a photo of a pinioned pelican](https://flic.kr/p/8K2w1T) at the Bird Park.

While I don't like that Ivan was there, I can see SM Tharman's point. As the leader of the Jurong GRC team, he has certain actions he has to take and certain decisions he has to make. 

Ivan seems to have been a dick in his previous jobs and roles. But that is not necessarily what the residents of Jurong, or Tharman, saw. Tharman (and maybe Jurong) saw Ivan putting in tons of effort into working the ground - not just now, but over the years. I agree, it would only be right and the job of a leader to acknowledge that, and to let the residents he probably has connected with (if any) acknowledge that.

Edit: This imo is also the mark of a good leader. You cannot just anyhow drop your people when they become inconvenient hot potatoes. Imagine you're doing a project and your client doesn't like you so your team lead uses your background work and leaves you out of the due recognition process. Cannot la.

This is a huge slap to Jurong Residents face. We voted for a PAP party with tharman,knowing that ivan lim is out of the picture.

1923,22,e3r1f11,t3_957wqi,"I think there's a resident lone male that hangs around that area; I've seen him in that neighbourhood, and he's probably the same individual spotted at Lakeside MRT Station and nearby Jurong Lake.

Lone macaques are typically adult males that have left their families (troops). A female macaque tends to stay in the same troop she was born in, but as a juvenile male reaches sexual maturity (about 4 to 6 years of age), he spends more time apart from his mother, and in the company of other juvenile males. They hang around at the periphery of the troop, usually far away from the adult males, which will often see them as rivals and behave aggressively. Eventually, the young male will leave the troop altogether, sometimes alone, sometimes as part of a coalition of young bachelors. This is probably to prevent inbreeding, since the young male has a risk of mating with related females if he remains with the same troop. 

The young male will then wander around, and try to join another troop. At first, the adult males already in the troop will keep chasing him away, but he'll hang around the periphery until the others begin to tolerate his presence. He might groom the females, play with the babies, and as he grows into an adult, may even help the other males to defend the troop against rival troops or predators.

Eventually, if all goes well, the newcomer gets accepted into the troop. Then it's another struggle: of knowing who's higher ranking and who to groom and suck up to, making other adult males his allies, and rising up the hierarchy. If he gains the females' trust and acceptance (usually by grooming and helping to protect the babies), he may get the chance to mate, but he has to make sure that the alpha male isn't looking. Depending on his rank and his mating prospects in the troop, he might decide to leave again and search for yet another troop to join. 

Sometimes a lone male might try to skip the whole gaining acceptance and trust bit, and aim for the alpha. Or a gang of bachelors will try to take over a troop and take on the alpha. A strong alpha will have the support of the other males in his troop, and they will often also have the females to back them up.

Eventually, based on his intimidation and fighting skills, his allies, and popularity among the females, the newcomer might challenge the alpha and take over as the lead male of the troop, a position he'll hold for several years. The alpha male plays a key role: he decides the general movements of the troop as they forage through their territory, and where they should settle down for the night. He breaks up fights before they get serious, protects the females and youngsters against threats, and defends the territory against neighbouring troops trying to take over their space. Most importantly, he gets priority when it comes to mating (first access to females when they're in beat, plus females prefer to mate with the alpha anyway, although they're promiscuous and will mate with other males too, which means that all the males will protect the young since none of them know for sure who the father is), and as alpha, can end up siring a large proportion of the young born in that troop.

But life at the top takes its toll, and he always has to be on his guard, not just against other dispersing males trying to take over his place, but even his own subordinates and allies. Fights between adult males, especially when alpha status is at stake, can result in serious injuries. Eventually, another male challenges and successfully dethrones him. If he's lucky, he gets to stay as a subordinate, which gives him the opportunity to rise to alpha status once more. In other cases, he becomes a wandering loner again. He might disperse to another troop, and work his way up the new hierarchy. And so it goes for the rest of his life, which in wild long-tailed macaques is around 30 years.

But what happens if a lone dispersing male *horlan*, and instead of staying in the forest, ends up in an urban area?

Sometimes, he's just passing through, and he'll keep roaming until he finds another forest with macaque troops to join. But in other cases, he might just give up, and opt to stay and make the most of wherever he is.

It's not an easy life for a macaque in an urban area; he's in an unfamiliar environment, food can be hard to come by, he doesn't have the safety and security provided by being part of a troop, and he runs a high risk of getting run over by vehicles. He encounters people who don't know how to behave around wildlife, who get too close to him, take selfies and disturb him, or even scream and throw stones. Some well-meaning but misguided people feed him, thinking that they're being compassionate and doing something good, but what they don't realise is that they're encouraging the monkey to see humans as a source of food. Instead of seeing humans as scary creatures to avoid, he'll see them as a potential source of food, and he might end up approaching everyone he sees, expecting handouts. If other people don't feed him, but he sees them carrying food, he'll try to grab it. Or he might enter homes and shops to steal food. And in many cases, he'll target children, since they're smaller and not as dangerous. In a worst-case scenario, he gets provoked or someone tries to put up a fight when he's stealing food, and a human gets scratched or bitten.

As the conflict escalates and people complain, AVA usually ends up trapping the monkey. Most monkeys that are caught by the authorities are euthanised, since relocation and integration with other troops is not seen as a viable solution (although ACRES has had some success with rehabilitating juveniles and females and getting them accepted by other troops).

In any case, this male macaque seems to have been here for several years, and hopefully he manages to stay out of trouble.",t3_957wqi,07-08-2018

1990,22,eghlznu,t1_egh0mw8,"Sure thing buddy. I’m still an amateur compared to many of the pros here so hope I can give a simple explanation to what I did.

For planets you don’t need a very high end telescope. Mine is a Schmidt cassegrain, (uses mirrors and lens, looks like a drum but you can use even more basic ones. )Mine was a gift from my Wife that she bought at the omni theatre. The model is the celestron omni xlt 127. 

For planets you want higher magnification,  as opposed to celestial objects like nebulas and some galaxies which you need more light to come through the scope, and in singapore,  to get a nice shot of these other objects, you will need tracking and exposure shots to get more light and detail, things that I’m not even trying yet, cos I have a simple set up - tripod, mount, telecscope.

Higher magnification is not just from the scope but eye piece (think camera lens). The smaller mm eyepieces give you higher magnification, but also means less light comes through. That amount of light also depends on the aperture size and focal length of your main telescope.

So the good news, planets are easier to start with. You don’t need a Super high end  equipment . For this, I bought a universal smartphone adapter so I can clamp my mobile to The Eye piece. this adds a lot of weight to one end of the telescope so you need a sturdy set up, with good counter weights. Even then you see vibrations.

The Samsung note 8 I used had exposure control so I could zoom and adjust to see some detail, and take a video.

To find the planet, I used the android skymap app to spot it.


Hope this is clear! PM me if you want more details!

> A beloved pet going missing is always tough on owners, some of whom often spend much time and cash in search of the animal.

> In a rather epic story shared over several Facebook posts by one Raine Lim, one long-lost pet miraculously appeared three years later — and over 30km from its original home.

> New cat on the block

> Lim first posted on Feb. 3 about a new cat she had seen around Blk 146 Simei Street 2.

> The cat appeared to be in bad shape, appearing tired and grubby.

> It's paws were streaked with mud and dirt, and Lim added that its claws were long and overgrown.

> It also had cloudy eyes.

> A short clip of the kitty showed how thin its body was.

> Lim wondered if the cat was a long-lost pet.

> Although she had contacted SPCA asking if they could take the cat in, SPCA apparently denied her request as the cat did not require immediate medical attention.

> In the meantime, Lim said she would feed and clean the cat up, and monitor its condition.

> A long-lost pet?

> On Feb. 4, Lim posted a second ""big update"".

> Lim's speculations that the cat was a lost pet turned out to be true.

> She said that a woman had approached her claiming that the injured kitty at Simei looked exactly like her missing pet cat, Manis.

> Amazingly, Manis first disappeared from its home in Jurong West in 2018.

> Which leads to the conclusion that the small cat had possibly trekked from all the way from the west to the east over three years.

> Here are some old photos of what Manis looks like.

> Pretty similar to the cat in Simei.

> Lim added that she was ""90 per cent certain it's the same cat"".

> Reunited

> The woman subsequently went down to Simei to verify if it was really her missing cat. Thankfully, the cat was the real deal.

> Manis was finally reunited with its family after three long years.

> Manis' owners told Lim that they first picked him up as a kitten at Toa Payoh.

> When their house at Jurong West was undergoing renovation in 2018, Manis somehow escaped.

> In a third post, Lim expressed her happiness that Manis had finally been returned to his owners, and urged those with missing pets not to lose hope.

> ""He is finally reunited with his family after three years!! This is honestly so so unbelievable, but I am truly so so happy that he is back with his family. Don’t know how he travelled from Jurong West all the way to Simei! But this is truly a miracle!! To everyone that has a missing furbaby, don’t give up hope! There is a possibility that they are still out there, don’t stop posting about them, don’t stop looking for them. I hope one day all the missing pets will be reunited with their families, just like Manis did.""

Tungku Abdul Rahman made the unilateral decision for separation whilst recuperating from shingles in a London hospital. The decision was conveyed to GKS by his good friend Razak who went on to become Malaysia's 2nd PM. GKS was less confrontational and as all civility had already broken down between LKY and the Malaysians post his speech in their Parliament in Malay. 

GKS understood the reason and fully appreciated the challenges he faced with his counterpart Finance Ministry counterpart and cousin Tan Siew Sin. 

In essence it was a unilateral decision by Tungku and a fait accompli. That left Singapore to seek assurance and guarantee from the Malaysians on its impending sovereignty and support and sponsorship to full membership to UN.

But we do know that going into the meetings, Goh Keng Swee was already much more disenchanted with the Malaysia project than Lee Kuan Yew and most of the other senior PAP leaders, in large part because of his economic portfolio. In his oral history, Goh Keng Swee stated that

> Now on the 20th of July 1965, I met Tun Razak and Dr Ismail. Now this is the 20th July 1965. I persuaded him that the only way out was for Singapore to secede, completely.

My interpretation is that the Tungku was already leaning toward some form of separation, and GKS's role in the negotiations ensured that it would be a *complete* separation yielding an independent and sovereign Singapore.

Personally, having stayed in Woodlands for over 20 years, it has been pretty terrible for me. I wasted so much of my life commuting. 

Plus food scene here is so sad. Made worse when they tore down the old Woodlands market. And if you stay on the other side where there are no hawker, with mostly food courts in neighbourhood malls, food is also generally more expensive than hawker in mature estates. 

But if you have a car, Woodlands is about equal distance to most places in SG. Almost everywhere is 30-40 mins. That's good. But at the same time, it's equally far to most workplaces, unless you work in the north. 

People love saying ""Woodlands good, go JB near"". Having been chased by gangsters there when I was younger (during sec sch) multiple times and know some of my friends who frequent there got extorted and some got car stolen or broken in, I have no love for that place. I don't even think my woodlands friends goes to JB often tbh. I have so many horror stories of Johor, it's not even funny. 

On the whole, I personally fricking dislike this sh\*thole as a long time resident, but I also rate it higher than some estates in Jurong and Punggol. Would have moved out if not for saving $ to down as much as possible for a place in town when I get married.

Sports: the area was originally a sports complex, so it makes sense the mall has them since it was supposed to be a renovation of these facilities but evolved into a full fledged mall with these features integrated into the layout. So there’s an indoor running track, badminton/TT halls, swimming pools, football field etc. There’s laser tag. And obviously all the sport stores are there too. 

Community: a lot of screenings/live performances. I don’t think there’s ever been a time (pre-covid) I’ve gone there in the evening and there isn’t some movie being screened or a performance. During world cup they also did match screenings there with some really nice looking cushion chairs (altho up to you to lie on something a lot of ppl have probably been on lol). Also has a pretty nice and big Public Service Centre (PSC) for settling gov stuff. 

Families: sports facilities aside, also got like those childcare etc in the basement iirc. Fairprice for grocery shopping. The hawker centre is one of those social enterprise ones so meals are very cheap, and there’s a lot of options. There is a theatre there that [screens a few current movies for a low price](https://i.imgur.com/GuiKUOv.jpg) ($6 if you watch on a weekday with OTH passion card, $9 for weekend), altho there’s no online booking [obv this isn’t open now, thanks covid].

Basically a judge does not get to, based off of their own opinions or feelings of the public at that time of day, sentence someone to something that is out of precedence.

If two people committed the same act in exactly the same manner under the same circumstances, they should get the same sentence. So if you judge a case that has something very similar happen in the past, the decision has to be in line with the last decision, with the differences explained in detail.

If there was no prior case, it'll be a land mark decision. That's where you set the first case for future cases to take reference from.

The rule of law is that you rule by law, and you respect the past decisions. Not that today something else is different, public opinion changed, or the weather is different, then you as a judiciary gets to re interpret the law in different ways. That's activist ruling, and will likely get overturned in the upper courts.

To change the law, it has to be done in the legislative, by members of parliament, voted in by the people.",t3_ksw3ol,08-01-2021

My parent were at Safra for another similar event (despite telling not to <facepalm>), I think a walkable distance between both. 

Temperature and crowd recordings were taken at the event for precaution measures and my parent received the contact tracing call from MOH too (for precaution even though it’s different event halls) after they discover the cluster.

Its like she scared to go to the doctor cause she thinks she might have something which is fucking irresponsible.

I feel like it's an office culture thing also.

By doctor hopping, she was basically presenting with a standard URTI for the first time in each clinic. The final GP she went to had probably probed a lot more or the patient herself had volunteered more information which gave the doctor a good reason to look her up in the system. Doctor noticed a series of clinic visits, and decided to send her in for testing.

Always stick to the same doctor if you feel like you are not recovering. Best is to just have one primary care doctor that knows your entire history. Or polyclinic which can access. Everything electronically la..",t3_fdugi2,05-03-2020

Who am I to get upset over this? It literally feels like fate to me, something beyond my control.

However, we are also given free will to make our own choices. God helps those who help themselves. You can't just do whatever and then expect God to protect you. I see patients everyday and while I believe if I am meant to get infected, I will get infected, I still use my PPE at work and practice good hand hygiene etc. So yeah, I would just tell your fam that God gave them free will and a brain to think.

We've seen having plenty of cases where people with mild symptoms were told repeatedly by a GP to stay at home and were tested multiple times before being tested positive for COVID. So there may very well be cases of people who stayed home and recovered from this on their own. Also, a lot of infected cases have ended up recovering. Not to mention asymptomatic carriers who never realised they are infected. 

More and more will be infected and there will be peaks and troughs in the numbers of newly infected but I don't forsee a drastic change for the worst in our situation anytime soon.

I think we should still take this seriously by ramping up efforts in maintaining basic hygiene but since this COVID wasn't anywhere near as bad as SARS (so far), we may actually end up using more resources to this than necessary.

I’m sure worldwide elsewhere no country’s approach is to contain the virus anymore. Mostly, it’s just gonna be limiting the spread.

> The 36-year-old Indian national was found in the factory-converted dormitory in Fan Yoong Road in Jurong West.

> The police said they received a call for assistance at 1.45am and the man was pronounced dead by a paramedic. Investigations into the death are ongoing.

> A spokesman for the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said it was aware of the incident and expressed its condolences to the man's family.

> ""We have informed his family members and employer as well as the embassy,"" the spokesman told The New Paper.

> ""We are also working with the worker's employer and the Migrant Workers' Centre to provide assistance to his family.""

> Factory-converted dorms are industrial developments or warehouses that have been partially converted to living quarters for workers who typically work on-site.

> Almost 100,000 workers are currently living in more than 1,200 converted dorms.

> Monday's incident comes amid a recent spate of suicides and attempted suicides involving migrant workers in dorms.

> BETTER SUPPORT

> This includes assessing whether workers will be allowed to leave their dormitories on their rest days, Mr Wong said at a virtual press conference.

> The Health Ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said the interagency task force, together with the Ministry of Manpower and private stakeholders, has been working to support the welfare of such workers in various ways, including helping them celebrate holidays and providing avenues for help and counselling.

> He added that a work group is looking at mental health issues faced by the workers to see how their mental health can be better supported. - DAVID SUN

However, I dug up her [old case data](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/covid-19-3-new-cases-singapore-4-more-discharged), and she already had some symptoms on Feb 11.

>On Feb 24, she was referred to the Singapore General Hospital, where she was warded in an isolation room. She was diagnosed with Covid-19 infection on the afternoon of Feb 26.

I hope MOH can put together more pieces of the puzzle.

One possibility is that she was the one who brought the virus to the Jurong Safra dinner on Feb 15. If so, she certainly behaved irresponsibly and caused a lot of transmission. However, in her defense, one could argue that the GP didn't even send her for testing on Feb 17 and 20, so she might not have felt that her symptoms were serious.

Another possibility is that her symptom onset on Feb 11 was a red herring, and she actually got infected by someone else at the Safra Jurong dinner (or a prior singing class). That cluster did not become known as a cluster until [March 5](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/covid-19-five-new-cases-singapore-new-cluster-emerges-safra-jurong-private-function).

> Personal mobility device (PMD) food delivery riders showed little signs of abating as they continued to visit Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS) for the fifth consecutive working day (Nov. 11, 2019).

> However, the MPS at Taman Jurong took a rather tense turn when they confronted Ang Wei Neng, Member of Parliament for Jurong GRC, regarding the footpath ban that was enacted on Nov. 5.

> Ang, who is the representative for Jurong Central, was sitting in for Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam who was overseas.

> Advertisement

> “You take back all our freedom!”

> In a video of the session sent to Mothership (and uploaded to Facebook), an elderly man can be heard gesturing and shouting angrily at Ang, while a group of people stood around to watch.

> Around the elderly man were PMD riders dressed in their delivery uniforms, including those from Grab and Deliveroo.

> It appeared that most of the delivery riders were seated in chairs that were likely to be prepared by the MPS volunteers. Such a scene was also observed in Jurong last Thursday.

> “Can the government withdraw the law? Take back the law! Can? Yes or no!” the elderly man shouted.

> “Can you give us the S$7 million that we need on the spot [undecipherable]? On the spot!” he continued.

> “You take back all our freedom! You take all our freedom! You see….And now we become enemies! We are enemies inside our own country! Are you running a communist law now?”

> The elderly man was probably referring to the new S$7 million e-scooter trade-in grant announced by LTA last Friday (Nov. 8).

> Under this scheme, delivery riders will receive a grant of between S$600 to S$1,000 to trade in their e-scooters for regular bicycles, power-assisted bicycles (PABs) and personal mobility aids (PMAs).

> Then, the crowd can be heard urging the uncle to cool down.

> Someone else shouted: “We are human, not dog!”

> Advertisement

> PMD rider says they are not slaves of members of the public

> At one point, another man also accused Land Transport Authority (wrongly, if we might add) of breaching the Personal Data Protection Act when the latter took photos of PMD riders flouting regulations.

> He added that the “[members of the public] are the ones offending us and triggering our tempers here”:

> “We don’t owe them anything. We are not their slaves. We have served the country, we have contributed to our nation.”

> “Yet we never get back any benefits from the government,” he said to applause and cheers from PMD riders around him.

> Advertisement

> Later when a visibly stressed representative (in black blazer) of the group of PMD riders spoke up to try to calm the group, another man can be heard shooting him down saying:

> “We don’t want to ban. Legalise back! Anything (happens), you check the rules, (then) summon! Simple, give our live back!”

> The representative then said: “We need to also find a win-win situation! We cannot give them (the MPs) a hard time right?”

> As for MP Ang Wei Neng, not much could be heard from him in the video, but at one point, he said that he will take back all of the feedback he heard from this session.

> You can watch the video below:

> Here are other instances of PMD riders seeking help from their MPs:

> Edit: A previous version of this article stated incorrectly that the MPS was held at Jurong Central. It has been corrected.

If you’re a safe PMD user, the smart thing to do is maybe not sell your PMD right away and observe the situation. Honestly, it’s only been two weeks.

Now that PMDs are effectively banned, anyone who comes out on one can be easily classified as an errant rider. The arrest of whom would definitely bring joy to a number of people.

This will take a while, I suppose.. but it gives the government some time to come up with a proper plan.

Don't you think that this policy is a poor decision? Even if you believe that some PMD users have acted irresponsibly (I don't really contest this), and that they should be banned, enforcing a ban one day after announcing it and giving people whose incomes depend quite literally on PMDs no time to prepare strikes me as an unempathetic decision, to say the least.

Changing careers is a long term thing- some of these people are really quite short on options. And yes, they can apply for unemployment benefits. But this, too, takes time! And I don't believe that people working a perfectly honest job should be forced out of it without warning. By all means phase out PMDs. But the outright banning of them seems poorly construed.

Case 152 is an imported case involving a 65 year-old male Indonesian national who arrived in Singapore on 7 March. He is currently warded in an isolation room at Singapore General Hospital (SGH).He reported onset of symptoms on 28 February while he was in Indonesia, and had sought treatment at a hospital in Jakarta on 2 March. He presented at SGH on 7 March. Subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 8 March afternoon.

Case 153 is likely to be an imported case involving a 65 year-old female Singapore Citizen who had been in Indonesia from 25 February to 28 February. She reported that while she was in Indonesia, she had visited her sister who had pneumonia. She is currently warded in an isolation room at SGH.

Case 147 is an imported case involving a 64 year-old male Indonesian national who arrived in Singapore on 7 March. He is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID.He reported onset of symptoms on 3 March while he was in Indonesia. He had a fever when he arrived at Seletar Airport, and underwent a COVID-19 swab test at the checkpoint. He was conveyed by ambulance to NCID on 7 March night, and subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 8 March morning.Prior to hospitalisation, he mostly stayed at his rental apartment in the Oxley Road area.",t3_fftnyc,09-03-2020

In that case, the pandemic is harder to curb and more people will suffer.

For those who curse at people who exploit the healthcare in Singapore, please understand that it is only human to try and survive. It is selfish of them to exploit goodwill but also, on the other hand, we understand that the disparity in healthcare standard kind of forces them to be selfish.

A more nuanced approach would be helpful, not just for the visitors but the public health in Singapore.

3308,22,fk0up8o,t1_fk0uoz1,"**False dilemma**

A false dilemma (or sometimes called false dichotomy) is a type of informal fallacy in which a statement falsely claims an ""either/or"" situation, when in fact there is at least one additional logically valid option.The false dilemma fallacy can also arise simply by accidental omission of additional options rather than by deliberate deception. For example, ""Stacey spoke out against capitalism, therefore she must be a communist"" (she may be neither capitalist nor communist, or a capitalist who disagrees with portions of capitalism). ""Roger opposed an atheistic argument against Christianity, so he must be a Christian"" (When it's assumed the opposition by itself means he's a Christian). Roger might be an atheist who disagrees with the logic of some particular argument against Christianity.

> Malaysian workers who were found rough-sleeping in Singapore following the Malaysia lockdown were given temporary shelter at Jurong East Sports Hall.

> Member of Parliament for Jurong GRC Grace Fu praised a team from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) for their hard work in sheltering these Malaysian workers.

> MSF team and sports hall staff turned hall into suitable accommodation

> According to Fu’s Facebook post, the MSF team took less than two days to “activate and implement the plan to house Malaysians”.

> Staff at the Jurong East Sports Hall also “acted quickly” to turn the sports hall into suitable accommodation for the workers.

> At the Jurong East Sports Hall, the Malaysians were registered and handed a pack of essential items including toiletries, a towel, and toilet paper, as well as a sleeping bag.

> The sports hall also has shower facilities so they can wash up before leaving for work.

> The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth also asked members of the public whose sports hall bookings were cancelled on short notice for their understanding.

> Some workers left without accommodation after M’sia lockdown

> Malaysia’s sudden lockdown on Mar. 18 left many Malaysians who work in Singapore high and dry.

> The Singapore government announced on Mar. 17 that it is working with the private and public sectors to secure accommodation for these stranded workers.

> It is also providing companies with affected Malaysian workers S$50 per night for 14 days so that these businesses — many of which provide essential services such as healthcare, security, cleaning, transportation, waste management, facilities management and logistics — will not be severely disrupted.

> While some companies in Singapore — especially public transport companies — have risen to the occasion to provide alternative accommodation for their Malaysian workers, others were unable to, resulting in such a scene at Kranji MRT station.

> Workers were seen sleeping on mats on the cold, hard floor outside the station gates.

> Their minimal belongings were either piled next to them or used as makeshift pillows.

> Some were still waiting for their employers to find suitable accommodation for them. Others were not promised accommodation by their employers.

> According to a comment by Fu on her post, the Malaysian workers who were found rough-sleeping at Kranji MRT station were directed to the Jurong East Sports Hall at 2:00am.

> Malaysian workers who were unable to secure temporary accommodation in Singapore after Malaysia’s lockdown can contact Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (MOM) for help. More information can be found here.

> Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced on Apr. 9 that healthy foreign workers would be housed at numerous empty premises such as SAF camps, HDB blocks, floating hotels and Changi Exhibition Centre.

> Wong revealed that around 5,000 workers have already moved out of their dormitories.

> This move follows a large spike in the number of confirmed cases at foreign worker dormitory clusters on Thursday.

> Over 200 out of the new 287 cases are linked to these clusters.

> Housing foreign workers at separate locations could potentially stem the increase in cases, and ensure these workers, some of whom are working in essential services, can continue to work.

> Moving in

> A Facebook post by Pioneer, an entity under SAFRA, showed foreign workers moving into a few SAF camps.

> Pioneer stated that around 1,300 foreign workers had moved into vacant premises at Jurong Camp II and Bedok Camp II under the instruction of the Ministry of National Development.

> More workers will be progressively moved into temporary accommodations such as these in the coming weeks.

> These premises are currently not being used by SAF, and are not required for their operational activities.

> Stringent precautionary measures have been put in place at the camps.

> Workers are required to register and undergo medical checks before moving into their accommodation.

> Any person with a fever or respiratory symptoms will be denied entry.

> Safe distancing measures at camps

> In compliance with safe distancing measures, workers will have their meals at staggered timings, as well as undergo twice daily temperature checks.

> This is to ensure the safety of both workers and SAF personnel.

> Hoarding has also been installed to segregate the workers' accommodation from the rest of the camp.

> Wong added during the Apr. 9 press conference that should workers fall sick, they should be immediately isolated to ensure these venues do not become clusters as well.

> Nice.

> You can check out this video by MINDEF.

I had been a ""Woodlander"" since birth, but after I left Singapore for studies and work opportunities my old flat is reconstituted as ""Marsiling,"" and a separate entity from the rest of the ""hip and cool"" Woodlands.

When I was growing up, ""Marsiling"" was a neighbourhood that overlooked the Woodlands Checkpoint and the connecting Admiralty Road West (before Woodlands Waterfront made it popular again, this was a sleepy part of Singapore that was ignored by the hustle and bustle of the ever-changing development that happened elsewhere). The former Si Ling Secondary served as a schooling ground for people of that area. People who lived in this general area (see Google Maps for the roads named ""Marsiling"") don't generally have a reputable status owing to the old and ageing population that lived there, as well as how [Si Ling was notorious previously for being a haven for gangsterism](https://fionaseah.com/tag/si-ling-secondary-school/) so it comes to mind that the denizens there are also generally less well-off and secretly troubled (they are not *as troubled* as Yishun, though).

> A couple in Singapore found themselves on the receiving end of malicious rumours, purportedly just because the man worked late nights.

> Advertisement

> Neighbour spreading rumours

> Chen, a 40-year-old resident staying at Block 373 Jurong East Street 32, told Shin Min Daily News that his neighbours, an elderly couple, have allegedly been spreading rumours that Chen’s wife is a prostitute.

> Chen told the paper that when he moved into the Jurong East flat two years ago, he was working as a taxi driver and often came home just before dawn. According to him, his neighbours complained that he made too much noise when entering his house.

> Once, when Chen was leaving for work, his wife spotted a strange man loitering outside their door. After Chen was alerted to the fact, he doubled back and checked his house’s closed-circuit television (CCTV) before rushing downstairs after the stranger.

> Chen caught the man downstairs and said to Shin Min, “When I asked why he was behaving so suspiciously, he said that my neighbours told him my wife is a prostitute, so he came up to see.”

> Chen became worried for his wife and kids — a three-year-old boy and a set of twins.

> Advertisement

> Constantly filming Chen and family

> He said that since April this year, his neighbours started using their phones to film Chen and his family. He caught them on CCTV filming his wife breastfeeding his firstborn.

> He told Shin Min:

> “They sometimes loiter along my corridor for up to three hours. Sometimes, I wear shorts to dispose of my rubbish outside the house. They would film me from behind and tell the police that I walked naked outside the house.”

> Chen said that he once tried talking to the couple nicely, who agreed to reconcile, but not long after, they resumed their antics.

> Chen and his family have made plans to move elsewhere. It takes time to find an appropriate place to move to, but Chen hopes that before he is able to move, his neighbours won’t cause any more trouble for him.

The first thing that pops to mind is cost. Having it overground is going to be much cheaper to construct. The structure of the underground rocks also play a part. Maybe they aren't strong enough, and the cost to reinforce them might be prohibitive.

I don't necessarily agree that trains can achieve higher speeds while underground. The trains should have no problem reaching their operational speed in both cases.

Maintenance is a toss-up between needing to weatherproof the trackside components, and needing to regularly conduct tunnel inspections. From my limited experience, I'd say the overground lines will be easier to maintain.

3845,22,dyopb23,t1_dyomt3c,"to add on, building underground usually also requires things like road diversion. jurong is already very crowded. the roads are narrow, especially near the west tip and taman jurong area. it is difficult to build underground with the buildings so clustered together.

if you look at the alignment for thomson east coast line, downtown etc, they mostly align to the big roads. in jurong area, most of the road here are very small and squeezy.

I did heard from some relatives saying that it did boost confidence and had a certain faith in the security screening. This is not an act to boost confidence, with scanners and detectors, they're really firm in checking.

If Singapore intends to implement the system, they need to be prepared to launch it in full scale. You can't just possibly only favor certain personnels or selective screening, its not practical in security screening. The government also needs to be firm if they're going to fully implement it.

> The fire broke out on Nov 1 at around 4.30am on the 13th floor unit of Block 210A, Bukit Batok Street 21.

> Three people were taken to the Singapore General Hospital for burn injuries and smoke inhalation.

> In a statement issued on Friday (Nov 8), the SCDF said the fire had to be extinguished using water from SCDF's emergency vehicles after its officers found a few hose reel cabinets in the block locked with padlocks.

> After breaking one of the padlocks, there was no water supply for the hose reel inside the cabinet.

> SCDF said that town councils are responsible for the maintenance and proper functioning of their estates' fire safety measures.

> Later on the day of the fire, SCDF inspected the fire hose reels with representatives from the town council, which was then issued with Fire Hazard Abatement Notices (FHAN) under SCDF's framework for dealing with non-compliance with fire safety requirements.

> The notices are warnings issued that require town councils to fix the non-compliance.

> Should the SCDF detect non-compliance issues of the same nature during a re-inspection, the town council would receive a notice of a composition fine of up to $5,000 or even prosecution.

> Related Story SCDF deploys ladder to rescue two men from 13th floor Bukit Batok flat that caught fire

> ""SCDF takes a serious view of fire safety and will not hesitate to take action against any non-compliance with fire safety requirements,"" it said.

> The Straits Times has contacted the town council for comment.

4062,22,emfvoaa,t3_bk67vh,"One of the stupidest decisions they made was trying to have all the stores use the same colour scheme and font for their signs, and also change the names to have something about box at the back. This made it much harder to quickly identify which store was which, and the whole mall looked really boring.

And ever since the J-Walk was built, people would just walk an extra few minutes to go to IMM instead, or cross the road to get to JCube. Big Box has no niche, and it's poorly designed and was always doomed to fail. Jem and Westgate are fancy malls and have a huge advantage in being directly connected to two ends of the MRT station, JCube has the skating rink and is frequented by students, IMM has all the IMM things. There's nothing left for Big Box to do that the other malls aren't already doing better.

There's little reason for a brick and mortar shop now with e-commerce, except to offer cheaper prices **on bulky items** because no delivery (Recently saved $20 on a case by going to SLS).

> The Swensens outlet at Jurong Point Shopping Centre has had its license suspended for two weeks, from Jan. 25 to Feb. 7.

> Cockroach infestation

> The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) announced that it would be suspending the eatery's licence due to an accumulation of 12 demerit points within a year, under the SFA's Points Demerit System.

> The 12 points were racked up due to two instances of "" failure to keep licensed premises free of cockroach infestation.""

> SFA said that establishments that accumulate 12 or more demerit points could face up to four weeks' suspension, or even have their licenses cancelled.

> The suspended Swensens outlet will have to ensure that all food handlers working at its premises attend and pass the Basic Food Hygiene Course again, before resuming work.

> Public can provide details for SFA to investigate

> SFA said that members of the public who come across poor hygiene practices in food establishments can report them to SFA, with details for the agency to conduct follow-up investigations.

> They can do so online via a feedback form (https://csp.sfa.gov.sg/feedback), or call SFA's Contact Centre at 68052871.

> They are also advised not to patronise such outlets.

> Other outlets penalised by SFA

> Another food outlet that had its license suspended by SFA recently for poor hygiene practices was Eng’s Heritage at Northpoint City, where 26 diners suffered food poisoning.

> Meanwhile, Two Chefs, an eatery at Commonwealth, had its food hygiene grade lowered from a ""B"" to a ""C"" after 11 diners reportedly experienced symptoms of gastroenteritis.

Started noticing holes and scratches on my bananas however chalked it to either rot, lizards / cockroaches (not rats cause rest of the food untouched) or my dad cause he likes to use penknife to 'detach' the bananas.

It kept happening so one day I asked my dad, he denied and we started discussing. Ended the conversation without any conclusions and left with all the bananas in perfect condition. 

After 15mins lo and behole I went back to the kitchen and a [NEW HOLE](https://i.imgur.com/iH5AO2T.jpg) was there! Really damn shook cause didn't hear or see anything at all even tho I was in the living room, so decided to stay alert and try to see what or who was causing it.

It was only on the 2nd night that I spotted a bat flew in and out!! I finally knew why the discovery of the holes were so bizarre - the bat barely made any sound! Unlike birds that chirps and flap loudly, bats are dead quiet. I saw it flew in and out without making any sound at all! 

Told the dad and he was quite excited as bat in Chinese sounds like fortune, so that's a good sign according to him.

> A curious video of a bat munching on some fruits has been circulating on social media.

> What made the video, which has been posted to various Facebook pages, viral, was the fact that the bat was found on a NTUC FairPrice's fruit section.

> Munching on bananas

> In a clip posted to Facebook page All Singapore Stuff, a small bat can be seen clinging to a bunch of bananas hanging from the shelf.

> It appears indifferent to the camera filming it, and continues munching on the fruit.

> The mammal even seems to have chewed through the paper sticker label.

> Text in the video stated that this peculiar sight took place at the FairPrice outlet at Jurong East.

> One hour after it was posted, the video has already garnered over 700 shares.

> While some Facebook users expressed shock at the sight of the animal, others sympathised with it and urged the cameraperson not to harm it.

> Fruits have been moved indoors

> In response to Mothership's queries, FairPrice confirmed that they are aware of the circulating video and that the incident did indeed occur at the 24-hour FairPrice store at 345 Jurong East St 31.

> However, it did not occur inside the store, as netizens might have assumed from viewing the short clip.

> Instead, the bat was found munching on the bananas at the fruit display located outside.

> FairPrice stated that they have since moved all the fruits inside the store to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

> Checks have also been made to ensure any of the affected fruits have been discarded.

> FairPrice said they are in contact with the authorities to look into the cause for the presence of bats in the area, and apologised for any inconvenience caused.

> Likely a fruit bat

> The bat sighted is likely a Lesser Dog-faced fruit bat, which is a common species of bat in Singapore.

Shouldn't we be doing active testing of those who are in those specific parts of the mall instead?   


While testing everyone in the mall at those times is not very feasible, that is precisely why we have SafeEntry (which is enforced separately in FairPrice and larger shops INSIDE the mall) and TraceTogether, which can help us narrow the pool down to probably around a few hundred people who have been in close contact for active testing.  


Asking people to wait for symptoms to develop is quite irresponsible, some of these people in close contact may never develop symptoms and could be asymptomatic carriers - we simply will never know without active testing. (Look at how many cases we found from active testing of pre-school teachers.)

> SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (May 25) named Jurong Point's NTUC FairPrice and Shokutsu Ten Japanese Food Street as public places visited by Covid-19 cases for more than 30 minutes.

> In providing this list for the first time, it stated that a confirmed case had visited the NTUC FairPrice on May 20 from 4.30pm to 6pm.

> On May 21, a confirmed case visited the Shokutsu Ten Japanese Food Street @ Jurong Point from 5.30pm to 6.30pm.

> People who were at these locations during the specified timings should monitor their health closely for 14 days from the date of their visit, and see a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms, MOH said.

> There were 344 new Covid-19 cases in Singapore as of Monday noon, with the lower number of cases partly due to fewer tests being conducted.

> The new cases comprise 338 migrant workers living in dormitories, two work permit holders, one permanent resident and three Singaporeans, MOH said on Monday evening.

> This brings Singapore's total count to 31,960.

> There were six new cases in the community on Monday, up from the four community cases reported on Sunday.

> Three of the six community cases were picked up during the screening of pre-school staff. One of them was a 25-year-old pre-school employee who went to work at Learning Vision @ NUHS.

> A fourth is linked to the CDPL Tuas dormitory cluster, a fifth to the Cassia @ Penjuru cluster, while the sixth, a 48-year-old man from China, has been linked to a previous contact but not to any cluster.

> There were no new clusters for the second consecutive day.

> With the 862 more cases discharged on Monday, 49 per cent, or 15,729, of the total Covid-19 patients in Singapore have fully recovered from the disease.

> The rate of discharge picked up about three weeks ago, with daily discharge figures exceeding new patients in the past fortnight.

> This leaves 16,199 active cases who remain either in hospital or community facilities, of whom eight are in the intensive care unit according to Monday's update.

> The average number of new daily community cases has risen in recent days, with MOH partly attributing this to active surveillance and screening of nursing home residents and pre-school staff.

> The daily average has increased from four two weeks ago to seven in the past week, while the number of unlinked community cases has remained stable at two per day for the last two weeks.

> Singapore has seen 23 deaths from Covid-19 complications, while nine who tested positive have died from other causes.

> Globally, the outbreak, which began in December last year, has infected more than 5.4 million people. Some 345,000 have died.

MOH advice was to ""pay attention to symptoms"", but since 30-60% of COVID-19 patients have no symptoms whatsoever yet are still infectious, isolate suspects first, then test a few times during 14 days seems to be the safest.

At the moment, MOH has insufficient capacity to chase down people, isolate and test them that way; hence the current advice.

They have identified close contacts in specific areas of the said locations, and likely they would be put on quarantine? Nonetheless I suppose relying on such information can never give an exhaustive list of people that have come into contact with the confirmed case. Hence I think the point of this annex C2 would be to list out specific places where the confirmed cases had been in place for a long time, and hopefully those people who have visited, pay more attention to any symptoms that may show.

Curious to why some of them stayed so long at those said locations though.

Relying on them to monitor themselves for symptoms seems to ignore the danger of asymptomatic cases who can still be infectious.

Is it really useful to point these locations out, because transmission is not supposed to be high in transient contacts?

Furthermore I'm not sure if it's feasible to test everyone, especially in the context of a crowded hypermarket due to the large number involved over 1.5 hours, and for the food street, if entry to the entire street itself is controlled by SafeEntry.",t3_gqd2e1,26-05-2020

Staff should have been the first to know, and likely those that had extended close contact with the infected would be quarantined, if they are able to cope, then make the staff go on LOA and not work?

I think this information will only be a bit more useful if it is possible to include which area the said infected person was active at, e.g. took 1.5 hours to choose a new TV at the electronics area etc. My thinking is that the person should have done something quite special in order for it to go into annex C2?

I feel incidents like these show a problem in Singapore. The Highway code is far too protective of pedestrians in Singapore. Hence, pedestrians do not learn or care about their own personal safety. Past instances saw drivers getting charged for knocking down Pedestrians who knowingly jaywalked, under the following:  ""Failing to keep a proper lookout"" Punishments have included jail terms.

Perhaps it is time that we update this with a clause: In an instance where the accident was directly caused by Individuals who knowingly violated traffic rules, the driver will not be eligible to be charged under the ""Failing to keep a proper lookout"".

> An elderly lady on July 31 was knocked down by a van while crossing the road outside of a designated junction along Jurong West Ave 1.

> Elderly lady knocked down while attempting to jaywalk

> A video of the incident was uploaded onto Facebook group Go-Jek Singapore Community.

> As seen in the Facebook user's dashcam recording, the woman was attempting to jaywalk across the road in Jurong West.

> As the vehicle doing the video recording slowed down as it approached a junction, the woman jaywalking raised her hand, appearing to signal to request the driver to give way to her as she hurried past the car.

> However, as she was looking the opposite way, a van driving on the right-most lane hit the woman dashing across, and knocked her down.

> It appeared the woman might have been in a blind spot.

> From the video, the woman also appeared to have hit her head on the ground after she was knocked down.

> The driver who recorded the incident stopped the vehicle, as one woman in the vehicle was heard saying to ""call ambulance"".

> SCDF arrived at location but no sign of case at scene

> In response to queries by Mothership, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said a call for help was made, but when its personnel arrived at the location, there was no sign of the incident.

> ""On July 31 at about 12:05pm, SCDF received a call for assistance along Jurong West Ave 1. There was no sign of case at the location,"" SCDF said.

I am not entirely sure about the specific laws here in SG, but I agree with one of the commenters below regarding the driver being in a machinery that can kill people.

The main point here should be the balance of power. In saying this, it does not justify or validate people jaywalking. I also understand that careful drivers still might encounter such problems even if the drive defensively. But as drivers which are trained and licensed to drive, they have the responsibility to keep everyone on the road safe, even if that means going the extra mile of looking out for jaywalkers, because a possible consequence or price you pay for being too lenient (for lack of a better term) on drivers is the possibility that hit and runs will also let irresponsible drivers off the hook.

There are better ways in managing jaywalkers, this should not be mutually exclusive to how drivers’ responsibilities are set and regulated.

Edit: added apostrophe. And this as well, it is kind of sad getting downvotes because you voiced an opinion that does not even criticize, but okay I guess.

If the driver has made all attempts to prevent an accident but the pedestrian is attempting to be at harm's way, then it's on the pedestrian to say why they should be off the hook. If the pedestrian is tested post-mortem with elevated levels of alcohol, then it is possible for the driver to make a counter-claim of the pedestrian being intoxicated and put himself in danger by making it dangerous for other drivers to avoid him.

4380,22,fbov7zr,t3_ee3a9n,"There's a mass migration of storks known as [Asian Openbill](https://singaporebirds.com/species/asian-openbill/) in Singapore - this species is usually found further north, in the Indian subcontinent, Thailand, and Indochina, but in the last decade, has started visiting the northern states of Peninsular Malaysia like Penang and Perak. At a time when many waterbird species are experiencing great declines in Asia due to all sorts of threats like habitat loss, hunting, collecting of eggs and chicks, human disturbance of nesting coloniesa and roosts, pesticides, pollution, and climate change, it's heartening that the Asian Openbill is still doing very well, with colonies numbering in their thousands in Thailand and Cambodia. This winter season, larger numbers of Asian Openbills seem to have flown even further south than usual, reaching Singapore. One possible reason that's been cited is that droughts, in combination with dams, have severely affected the Mekong this year, forcing the openbills to disperse and wander further.

This stork has an unusual [gap between its upper and lower jaws](https://flic.kr/p/2dQMsRx); even when the bill is closed, the gap can be seen very clearly. It's believed that the bill, shaped like a pair of forceps, enables the Asian Openbill to get a more secure grip on the smooth, rounded shells of its favourite prey, water snails, and helps it to extract the snail from its shell.

The Asian Openbill has been reported in Singapore on two previous occasions - six birds were seen [at Seletar West in January 2013](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/06/2013nis025-029-5.pdf) (that season also saw huge flocks dispersing to southern Peninsular Malaysia, where they were seen in Melaka and Johor), while a single individual was spotted [at Sungei Buloh in March this year](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2019/03/25/asian-openbill-singapores-2nd-record/). This time around, a flock of around 400 birds showed up in Kranji Marshes in early December. Smaller numbers have also been seen in Jurong Lake Gardens. Since then, flocks numbering probably more than a thousand individuals have been passing overhead all over the island. We have no idea where all of them travel to feed or roost, or how long they'll remain this far south; the large flocks might simply be flying over from Peninsular Malaysia, then heading back north, or possibly dispersing to feed in smaller flocks in open marshy areas and fields in more remote areas of Singapore and Johor. A few hundred are roosting in Kranji Marshes for the time being. This species has never been recorded from Indonesia, but it's possible that the Asian Openbill flocks might have already reached the Riau Islands and Sumatra.

[Here's an ST article](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/hundreds-of-asian-openbill-storks-in-singapore-in-rare-sighting-with-possible) about that initial sighting earlier this month (but premium), and lots of photographs and other reports on the various birdwatching and bird photography groups on Facebook.",t3_ee3a9n,22-12-2019

2021 is the 50th anniversary, having been in operation since 1971. The park was originally slated to be relocated to the Mandai area with the other animal parks, but 2020 delayed the planned move.

With that, the bird park decided to proceed with the golden jubilee year celebrations in the Jurong site.

Jurong Bird Park is Asia’s largest bird park and home to more than 3,500 birds across 400 species.

Since it started operation, the park has continuously improved its attractions to provide visitors with a fresh experience.

The bird park also has an on-going effort to breed and manage birds in captivity, especially rare and endangered species.

In case you were wondering, I didn’t encounter any UwU. But the hornbills were legit louder and blasting their trumpets.

Also, (surprised but not surprised), the endangered bali mynahs make the same sound as the wild javan/common mynahs that we see everyday. I guess all bird talk are the same (yes, it’s a lame joke. Give me your angry upvotes now!)

It’s your last chance to visit the Jurong Bird Park this year, before the scheduled relocation to the new Mandai site next year in 2022.

> SINGAPORE - Seven men were arrested on Tuesday (May 21) for their suspected involvement in the illegal transaction of marine gas oil at the sea off Benoi Basin, which is near Jurong Island.

> The suspects, aged between 20 and 48, were all nabbed as part of a joint operation between the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and the Police Coast Guard.

> Three of the suspects were crew members of a craft belonging to a marine service provider, while the other four were crew members of a foreign-registered tugboat.

> The crew members of the marine service provider's craft are believed to have misappropriated three tonnes, or 3,000kg, of marine gas oil without their company's knowledge.

> They then sold the marine gas oil to the crew of the foreign-registered tugboat, which was seized for investigations.

> The three crew members of the marine service provider's craft are due to be charged in court on Wednesday with criminal breach of trust as a servant.

> If found guilty, they face up to 15 years in jail, and may also be fined.

> Related Story Crimes surrounding oil not uncommon

> The four crew members of the foreign-registered tugboat are to be charged in court on the same day with dishonestly receiving stolen property.

> If found guilty, they may be jailed for up to five years, fined, or both.

> The police said in a statement that the Police Coast Guard and the MPA take a serious view of the illegal transaction of marine fuel in Singapore waters.

> ""The Police Coast Guard will continue to conduct enforcement and security checks to prevent, deter and detect such illicit activities in Singapore waters,"" said the police.

So why not they actually build a proper centralised temporary bus interchange for the long-term from the start that will not be affected by the ongoing developments instead?

4529,22,dxdno2s,t3_8c7phl,"So the way it works is this:

Most of the plants out there have something called a flare, which is not normally in use. They do have combustion going on, but it is not an exposed flame, and what is being burned is done in a controlled manner and they have some processes after the burning to limit the amount of pollutants and green gas houses. 

However, sometimes because of some system upset, the product they are making, or some of the intermediates (what gets made on the way to make the product) is of bad quality. If the volume is large or if they have a no blending policy (mixing good product with bad until becomes average product) or for any other big reason they simply can't keep the product or sell it, they burn it off in their flare. this is an open flame, at the top of a pretty high stack. Depending on the plant size, production volume, type of material, etc. you can end up with a very large and bright flame. 

Plants hate flaring because you are burning away material, which is a waste of money, and because they have to pay a fine as they are releasing a lot more pollutants and green house gases than usual/allotted volume.  So it si quite rare to see flares (unless the company sucks, in which case they won't be open for long/under the same management) and I think this is most likely the case. ",t3_8c7phl,15-04-2018

Most cases will be mild ones but it's the transmission rate that concerns me, especially since we're not testing on a scale similar to S. Korea. And that seems to have bred some complacency. I've seen all-too-many people coughing into the air or running around without a face mask in spite of having visible symptoms. Queued in front of someone who wouldn't keep their distance despite constantly sniffling and clearing their throat the other day, and it made my skin crawl a little.

> SINGAPORE - A 70-year-old Singaporean man has become the 10th person to die from complications due to Covid-19 in Singapore, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its daily update on Tuesday (April 14).

> The man, who was case 128, was part of the Safra Jurong cluster and had attended the dinner event on Feb 15 at Joy Garden Restaurant. He tested positive on March 6 and was warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).

> The NCID has reached out to his family and is extending assistance to them, the MOH said.

> Another 25 patients have now recovered and were discharged, bringing the total number to 611, the ministry said. This number includes the case 1604, who tested positive after he died at home from ischaemic heart disease while awaiting the test results.

> Of the 334 new confirmed cases on Tuesday, 198 were linked to known clusters, with the vast majority of them being work permit holders in foreign worker dormitories.

> One patient was linked to 10 earlier cases, forming a new cluster at PPT Lodge 1A, a foreign worker dormitory in 8 Seletar North Link.

> Singapore's largest cluster, the S11 Dormitory, which is located in 2 Seletar North Link and is also known as PPT Lodge 1B, saw an additional 132 new cases. The dormitory now has a total of 718 cases.

> Most of the other foreign worker dormitories also saw new cases. The cluster at Sungei Tengah Lodge saw 32 new cases, bringing the total to 188.

> Besides those linked to dormitories, another 22 were linked to other previous cases, including 10 who are Singapore citizens or permanent residents and 12 who are work permit holders.

> A further 114 cases are pending contact tracing, including 24 Singaporeans and PRs, 85 work permit holders, three S Pass holders, an employment pass holder and a dependent's pass holder.

Just a bit of context, the guy is well insured and is also covered by US government medicare. He won't have to pay anything of pocket.  Also the billable rate of 1.1 million dollars is a piece of administrative fiction. The insurer will bulk negotiate all of these bills down and pay only a percentage of the total. The US government already has this baked in how medicare pays hospitals.

Note that it is the case both things can simultaneously be true.--The US healthcare system is  hugely overpriced and needs to be fixed. For now, being covered by good insurance is very advisable if you can afford it. ( Good insurance is also likely advisable here in Sg)

He was involved in setting up several of our joint ventures and oversaw our collaboration with China’s Silk Road Fund as a partner to SJ Capital. As Eng Cheong embarks on a new adventure, I would like to thank him for his lasting contributions to Surbana Jurong and wish him the very best.”

> It is unclear who will be taking Teo's place.

> Teo Eng Cheong

> Prior to joining Surbana Jurong, Teo was a senior government official with the Singapore Administrative Service. From 2011 to 2015, Eng Cheong was CEO of International Enterprise Singapore (“IE Singapore”).

During a trip to the Jurong Fishery Port in May, marine scientist  Naomi Clark-Shen and shark activist Kathy Xu spotted a fish for sale so  rare, it was on the verge of being classified extinct.

Based on the ray's distinct colour pattern, they believed it was the  clown wedgefish (Rhynchobatus cooki). They took measurements,  photographs and tissue samples from its pectoral fin for further  analysis, and later confirmed their find.

They were there as part of a scientific project to monitor landings  and imports of elasmobranchs - a group that includes sharks and rays -  at the Jurong and Senoko fishery ports.

Their rediscovery of the rare fish, collected only 12 times before,  stopped the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) - the  global authority on the conservation status of the plants and animals of  the world - from listing it as being possibly extinct in the wild.

The merchant selling it said it was caught in waters in Indonesia,  although he could not pinpoint the exact location, said Ms Clark-Shen.

The find highlights the importance of further research, and prompts  discussion on potential species conservation and population recovery,  said Ms Xu.

Dr Peter Kyne is the senior research fellow at Charles Darwin  University in Australia who led the assessment for the extinction risk  of the ray for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. He told The  Straits Times that the finding was ""extremely significant"", as it  suggests that there is a population remaining somewhere.

The species was initially assessed as being ""critically endangered (possibly extinct)"", he said.

""Possibly extinct is a tag we add to species that have not been  recorded for some time, but for which there remains some uncertainty  about (their) continued persistence. We assigned this tag because there  were no records of the species since 1996.""

The Singapore find came just days before the classification was to be  locked down for publication, said Dr Kyne. ""I was able to amend the  assessment and remove the 'possibly extinct' tag before it went to  publication.""

The clown wedgefish had already had its fins removed, said Ms  Clark-Shen and Ms Xu, and its meat was being sold for about $3 to $4 per  kg.

 

ST had earlier reported that the fins of ray species, including the  critically endangered shovelnose ray native to Singapore, are highly  prized for their use in shark's fin soup.

Because sharks and rays take a longer time than other fish to reach  sexual maturity, and have fewer offspring at a time, their numbers in  the wild have plummeted from overharvesting. Trade in some of these  species is restricted internationally, but these animals are still  hauled out of the oceans in nets, for example.

One of the aims of the study by Ms Clark-Shen and Ms Xu, funded by  the Wildlife Reserves Singapore Conservation Fund (WRSCF), is to see if  traceability in the supply chain can be developed.

""We hope to recommend regulations and restrictions that would ensure  shark and ray populations do not deplete. (These) could be fishing  regulations or the development of protected areas in key habitats,"" said  Ms Clark-Shen.

Dr Sonja Luz, WRSCF honorary director, said the finding reaffirms the  value of the study. ""Without it we simply had no idea what we are  taking out from the sea,"" she said.",t3_dffvcu,10-10-2019

4906,22,dyoii7o,t3_8i2xt6,"SINGAPORE — At 24km long, with 24 stations, the Republic's seventh MRT line, Jurong Region Line (JRL), will open in three phases from 2026.

Slated to commence operations the year the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail is scheduled for completion, the JRL will connect the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Pandan Reservoir and Tengah area to the existing Choa Chu Kang and Boon Lay stations.

Unveiling the JRL alignment during a work site visit to the upcoming Canberra station on the North-South Line (NSL) on Wednesday (May 9), Transport Minister and Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure Khaw Boon Wan called the new line ""a quantum leap"" for Jurong's transport infrastructure.

The new line, which will run above ground, together with the upcoming KL-Singapore High Speed Rail, will give commuters ""convenient connections not just within western Singapore, but also to Malaysia"", he said, complementing the development of the Jurong Lake District into the ""largest commercial hub"" outside the Central Business District, alongside development of the new Jurong Innovation District into the ""next generation industrial estate"".

""When all these plans come together, Jurong will be a waterfront business hub nestled in greenery, served by good public transport connections, as well as amenities to support active mobility … This is our vision for Jurong,"" Mr Khaw added.

While the JRL improves the area's connectivity, the minister noted that it will also bring ""resilience"" to the entire MRT network. 



This is as commuters will have more choices when any of the two main lines, North-South Line or East-West Line (EWL), breaks down, since the JRL is connected to both Choa Chu Kang and Boon Lay.

""This will help to also distribute and relieve train loading between Choa Chu Kang and Jurong East stations, so that commuters can enjoy more comfortable rides,"" he added.

The Jurong area is currently connected by roads via the Pan Island Expressway and the Ayer Rajah Expressway. By train, the area is served by Lakeside, Boon Lay, and Jurong East stations, as well as Joo Koon and Tuas stations, which came into service in 2009 and 2017 respectively as extensions to the EWL.

On Wednesday, Mr Khaw also separately announced that Canberra Station, the new MRT stop between Sembawang and Yishun stations on the NSL, is expected to open for service by December next year, ""hopefully before Christmas"".

The construction of the station located along Canberra Link in Sembawang is on track to be completed for testing and commissioning in October next year.

Works commenced in early 2016, and to date, the station is 55 per cent completed, with more than 1.3 million man hours put in.

Canberra Station is the second station to be integrated onto an operational MRT line, with EWL's Dover station being the first.

Its addition will also put 17,000 more households within a 10-minute walk of a train station, putting the Ministry of Transport closer on its goal to bring eight in 10 households within that radius by 2030.",t3_8i2xt6,09-05-2018

> SINGAPORE:One person died after a massive fire broke out at a Jurong industrial area that involved hundreds of LPG cylinders, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said on Friday (Jun 21).

> SCDF said it was alerted to the incident at 43 Jalan Buroh at about 5.10pm. The fire was brought under control at about 7.30pm, it added.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""The raging fire involved Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders in an LPG facility of about two football fields in size,"" it added in a Facebook post.

> An SCDF spokesman at the scene said the fire involved hundreds of LPG cylinders, the largest number the force has seen battling a fire.

> Two workers suffered burn injuries and were taken to Singapore General Hospital.

> About six SCDF emergency response vehicles and three police cars were at the scene when CNA visited the site at about 6pm.

> At least two men were sitting by the side of the road with injuries. One had bandages on his arm and knee. The other had bandages on his arm, back and the side of his head, and was later helped into a wheelchair by emergency responders.

> SGSecure mobile app users with M1, StarHub and Singtel within the immediate vicinity of the fire have received an advisory message urging them to stay away from the affected area, said SCDF.

> Videos sent to CNA show flames and clouds of thick smoke rising from the area. Residents reported hearing multiple sounds of explosions.

> Photo of rising black smoke seen from Bukit Batok. (Photo: Jonan Gan)

> Eyewitnesses said smoke from the fire could be seen from areas including Teban Gardens, Clementi, Cantonment Road and as far away as Bishan.

> Smoke seen from an apartment in the Bishan area near Lornie Road.

> CNA reader Carol Lee said she was picking her husband up at the building opposite the fire, and could feel the heat from where she was about 200m away.

> ""I saw the fire follow by an explosion sound a lot of times until can't count. It was very scary. The smoke smelt like chemicals, not the normal smoke,"" she said.

> Another CNA reader, Muhammad Farihin, described what he saw as ""balls of fire"" from his apartment at Yung Kuang Road. ""There were explosions too,"" he added.

> Lilliane Reyes was changing her toddler when she heard what she thought was ""loud thunder"".

> ""I just thought that was just a very loud thunder then the baby said 'ohh, what's that?' ... Then when I stood up I saw big dark smoke.""

> Michael Toh was travelling from Tuas Checkpoint towards the city when he saw the fire.

> ""There was thick black mushroom smoke skywards. Traffic slowed down due to the distraction and partially due to peak hours jam,"" he said.

4975,22,fwoctjk,t3_hjrrb0,"I am in jurong grc. as a voter, this is how i think about it. as MPs, i will say jurong grc has it quite good. you do see the MPs around more often than prob how some other grcs are. tharman is a strong presence. and in prior years, i have nothing really to say against the PAP contenders.

in 2011 and 2015, the opposition was also weak. NSP and SingFirst came to contend but they sent in their weaker teams. i do like an opposition presence but i do need to feel something in them for me to vote for them.

RDU is prob the best among the oppositions in my years as an eligible voter. I think they are not expecting a win. But if they really want to be around, they just need to make their presence known for them to start somewhere. And looking at the candidates, even if they are not as high-calibre as some other parties, they are still not a pretty bad bunch.

My current MP is of to west coast and so possibly it's one of the other two new guys who's taking over. Shawn Huang, who did have some controversy, but managed to sort it out so I have nothing against him. If Ivan Lim was still in, I will say 100% my vote will have went to RDU. They instead got a replacement who actually might be quite a good candidate from what I have seen.

But there is still one big factor which is making me hesitant to vote, which is Tan Wu Meng. His post that was accusing Pritam Singh, and in association WP, of allying with Alfian Saat left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. And him hiding behind other Ministers while he kept quiet definitely did not improve my impression of him. So for the first time, I have something against the PAP MP and find the opposition favourable enough. And Tharman will probably be stepping down soon and knowing that PAP might still be a stronghold do make me think i could have a chance in voting RDU to give them less of a mandate.

In saying that, I am always open and will make up my mind when am at the voting booth. Probably the last time I felt this was during the PE 2011. Looking forward to getting to know more information before I finally cast my vote on 10 July. For whatever it is, I'm glad I am given a chance to vote than a walkover. Even how weak the opposition might be. So I thank RDU for at least trying to give us a choice, even being the newest kid in the block.",t3_hjrrb0,02-07-2020

4979,22,fwo5l6i,t3_hjrrb0,"To elaborate, what I desire is an opposition of good quality that will at the very least make the incumbent take notice.

You can see him having coffee with the general public at Taman Jurong hawker.
For me being in touch with the public wins my vote. Where's RDU until elections? 

It's important that basic needs must be met first which in my opinion they are. Enbloc IMHO is just a money making scheme which is fine if you don't mind all the hassles of moving and all the other uncertainties.

Since I personally think that their caliber might be better than reform, People's voice and NSP.",t3_hjrrb0,02-07-2020
4985,22,fwog7mv,t1_fwoctjk,"Well said. Props should be given to RDU for even daring to contest in Jurong since Tharman is very popular. So even walkabouts might be more stressful compared to other GRCs, not to mention the higher possibility of losing their deposit.

Not having a walkover again... Oh man, Singapore has come a long way. For 2006 elections, 37 seats were walkovers.

For 2011 elections, 5 seats were walkovers.

For 2015 elections, it was the first time since post-independence (and since 1963 elections) that there were no walkovers.

Hopefully PAP can realise that having opposition members in parliament who are elected might not be a bad thing so they can focus on making good policies instead of verbal banter. I mean, do they really need to stoop so low for an established ruling party with a solid foundation that LKY built up?

The Tan Wu Meng incident is really out of line, and Shanmugan seems to be really gaslighting here and there this time around. He used to be so dedicated to dealing with important issues, but now he's just burning opposition members here and there.",t3_hjrrb0,02-07-2020

(who tf puts up a 13.5k deposit and dares to contest not just as opposition, but as opposition against *Shanmugam*, if they're half-hearted? and isn't it hypocritical to say this after moving Ministers around GRCs like chess pieces?)

Goodness can this guy just stfu and go back to the PAP campaign slogans focusing on jobs

Him and the type of politics he represents are, on an emotional level (i.e. outside of levelheaded concerns on policy, supermajority etc.), possibly the single biggest thing deterring me from voting PAP. It might not be very rational of me, but I genuinely can't stand bullies like him.

5003,22,fwr1rpc,t1_fwp8jh2,"Wow thanks for sharing the news on Shanmugan criticising WP's very popular video. Wah what is this level of mudslinging? It's just pathetic. How could he have sunk this low? Just because PAP cannot come out with good publicity videos (they are very good at putting up several of the same bland posters and publicity materials to residents though) does not warrant a criticism of a better production.

It's like PAP has gone quantity over quality. Quantity of criticisms and PR materials have increased exponentially while quality has severely been reduced. Not to mention, the new candidates' introduction speeches seem robotic and read from a template, dispassionate and insincere. 

Not to forget Ivan Lim, who was criticised online for his recurring behaviour in society before pulling out. No matter what is said, it is clear that PAP rarely has anyone pulling out due to controversies, and this should say something. Examples are 2011 Tin Pei Ling and 2020 Murali Pillai.

I came across a reddit post where some redditors were criticising about Janus Lim from WP in the first election debate with Vivian and 2 others. It's hilarious. While most people said that his performance was amazing, there were quite a few redditors who criticised him based on his 'jumpy behaviour' and 'looks'. I was absolutely appalled by this level of intellectual discourse. Why? 

Because this shows that they clearly cannot criticise Janus based on his performance and character, so they just make stupid personal attacks. 

Shanmugan is no saint as Minister of Law for the past 5 years. Remember the Monica Baey case? It was just one of many of the public outcries in the last 5 years, including POFMA and the reserved presidential election.
