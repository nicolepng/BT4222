Tales from Chinese folk religion sometimes involve Buddhist concepts or even Buddha himself. The same goes for the relationship between folk religion and taoism.

I mentioning that because Hinduism is so encompassing that it even absorbs criticism, cynicism, satire, rhetoric etc very well and its greatness wouldn’t reduce by anyone’s remarks!

> A pair of hornbills that frequent one coffee shop at Loyang Industrial Park has become an online sensation after a video of their antics went viral.

> https://mothership.sg/2020/11/hornbills-fed-banana-loyang-coffee-shop/

> The pair of hornbills were caught eating food scraps and were fed with bananas at said coffee shop.

> Hornbills are regulars at the Loyang coffee shop

> According to the Chinese daily, Lianhe Zaobao, the hornbills were regular patrons at the coffee shop for the past few months.

> It started at around the Circuit Breaker period, and there were initially three to five of them.

> More recently, only the two hornbills will come to the coffee shop as seen in the video.

> The hawkers and regular patrons are familiar with these hornbills.

> Some people would even come to the coffee shop just to see these majestic looking birds.

> Won't leave without a free meal

> Zaobao also spoke to a 48-year-old dish collector, Tan, who uses his own money to buy bananas for the hornbills.

> He was spotted feeding bananas to them in the video.

> According to Tan, the hornbills are unlike the mynahs and sparrows.

> They do not swoop into the coffee shop to disturb patrons and eat food scraps that are in the coffee shop.

> Instead, the duo wait obediently at one of the tables at the outdoor seating for the free meal, Tan told Zaobao.

> ""A customer told me this type of birds eat fruits. They will leave after they are done eating,"" Tan said.

> Tan did not expect that feeding hornbills become part of his daily routine, but if the hornbills do not get their bananas, they will not leave.

> That leads him to prepare two bananas for the uninvited guests daily.

> Some viewers are amused by the sight, while others are concerned that the constant feeding would alter the wild birds' behaviour which can lead to human-wildlife conflict in the future.

> Why feeding wild animals can have negative consequences

> While Tan might find it difficult to leave the hornbills disappointed, this routine can cause the wild birds to see humans as a source of food.

> Acres explains that once the hornbills get used to being fed, they might approach any human (not just Tan) for food.

> As they grow comfortable with people, through daily interaction with Tan for example, this could lead to unwanted human-wildlife conflict when the duo approaches strangers who are not prepared to give them food at all.

> Feeding has resulted in rogue macaques and aggressive boars, encounters with which Singaporeans are not unfamiliar.

> The truth is, hornbills in Singapore have an abundance of food to consume.

> As omnivores, they prey on small birds, reptiles, and fruits in the wild. As they consume fruits in the wild, they perform an important ecological function as seed dispersers too.

> That is why Acres urges people to not feed hornbills (and any wild animals) and appreciating them from a distance.
