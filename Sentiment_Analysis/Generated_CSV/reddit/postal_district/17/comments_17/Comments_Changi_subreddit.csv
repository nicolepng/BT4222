443,17,gkf8trc,t1_gkd7all,"> Nobody seems to care that 600 people died from it in 2019, we never went to these extremes for the flu...

That's right. We don't take extreme - in fact, any - steps to stop normal flu, and just 600 people die (putting aside the fact that the death rate for flu is generally estimated and for Covid, more strictly counted and therefore underestimated). We don't take steps to stop Covid, and here's where that will get us: ""a report in March by Imperial College London in the United Kingdom estimated that if we had taken no steps to slow the spread of the coronavirus, 81 percent of the population would have contracted the virus over the course of the epidemic"". 

[Good read for you](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-covid-19-isnt-the-flu#More-deaths-in-a-shorter-span) - note this was published in May before the worst of Covid hit Western countries, so the death toll is many many times worse than in this article. Covid's also mutated at a much higher rate than seasonal flu since then. 

I can't believe it's a year in and people, especially *Singaporeans* who had the advantage of already seeing SARS, are still parroting the same ""it's just a seasonal flu"" rumours that stopped the UK etc from getting prepared early on (I lived in the UK for years before this.)

It may not be so in Singapore, but many of my friends in the UK and US know people who have died due to Covid, or whose family or friends have died due to Covid. You can't say the same for seasonal flu, so please stop trying to argue with the doctors and statisticians.",t3_l3b2g0,23-01-2021
444,17,gkdjwf6,t1_gkd7all,"We avoided elderly infection and their death as a result. More importantly, our healthcare system was not significantly strained. 

The overwhelming majority of other similarly wealthy countries have had their breaking points tested to varying levels. 

And so many healthcare systems are being overwhelmed right now thanks to the very winter surge that people have been talking about for months. 

Not to mention the more infectious variants of the virus taking advantage of inadequate mask mandates social distancing regulations, and enforcement. 

Being inadequately informed at this point, or simply being unable see the difference in the level of chaos and long-term consequences that we have and will face is fine. We have done an inadequate job at public messaging in Singapore on why these measures are necessary, and what we are getting out of it.

the person diagnosed with covid can be from other cluster, but if he is linked to this cluster, it would be a nightmare to trace all 31 person AND their family members as well as every single person all the 31 person came into contact with.

Each additional person above 8 is going to make contact tracing **exponentially** more difficult. 

Sure you can skirt the law by dividing your big family into a few groups and take turns interacting with one another. But the fact remains that all 20-30 of you mingled with each other on the SAME DAY and in the event that someone linked to your family is diagnosed with covid, contact tracing would take such a long time to do that by the time the entire family and their contacts have been traced, covid would have already spread far and wide and impossible to tracked using simple methods anymore.

The most important distinction is between Science, and Engineering. Science will tell you that everything theory related, that given certain loads, certain combinations will happen. For example, as a Civil Engineer, theory tells me a beam and slab of certain thickness will work in reality. But you’ll quickly realise that it’s unfeasible. How would you construct and transport a 20m long beam from the factory to the site? How would you fit slabs, the lighting, beams and columns within a specified area? How would you account for the bolts and pins to be installed? 

All these are questions that theory doesn’t answer. I’d extrapolate to the field of legality and regulations. How would you enforce a nationwide law? How certain are you that the entire nation followed the lockdown measure to a T? How do you enforce the 8 people group measure? 

Reality has already shown that people remain to hang out in groups more than 8, albeit separated into different groups. How are you going to work around this? Everything is easy in theory, where assumptions are plentiful and reality completed ignored. Now bring it to reality, like how Engineers bring Science and put it into action. Then you’ll come to realise that you can whine till the cows come home about how people won’t follow the measures. What do you do then?

Maybe instead of a calculated 15 people maximum group size, you only allow up to 8 people. That way, you have a margin of safety and even if people exploit your 8-people rule, it was already factored for and expected.",t3_l3b2g0,24-01-2021

On your point of enforceable or not. At the end of the day, all laws are nothing but guidelines for society to operate within. Hence, the laws are different based on context and geography. The reason murder and theft are illegal, is that society dictates it is. And therefore, we equip the police and authorities with measures to enforce this.

Example - 377A. Government can pass the law dictating gay sex to be illegal. But it’s pretty apparent no one enforces this? That, the general crowd remains in support of rights for LGTBQ+ groups.

- Bad golfer might aim a bit too far out
- Wind contributes to ball’s speed towards the attraction (I’ll take the 95th percentile probability; ie there’s only a 5% probability the wind is more than I designed for)
- Consider a spin on the golf ball that accelerates the ball towards the junction
- Take a 95th percentile of the speed/power exerted by the golfer

All already very conservative? Now, I’ll slap on a ton of partial factors since reality is far from ideal (I multiple the wind load and golf ball speed by 1.5).

I’ll take the most conservative approach here:

- Bad golfer might aim a bit too far out
- Wind contributes to ball’s speed towards the Mile (I’ll take the 95th percentile probability; ie there’s only a 5% probability the wind goes more than I designed for)
- Consider a spin on the golf ball that accelerates the ball towards the junction
- Take a 95th percentile of the speed/power exerted by the golfer

All already very conservative? Now, I’ll slap on a ton of partial factors (I multiple the wind load and golf ball speed by 1.5 just to design it even more conservatively).

> Wind contributes to ball’s speed towards the attraction (I’ll take the 95th percentile probability; ie there’s only a 5% probability the wind is more than I designed for)

I can probably find the value of wind speed off of some stat board in Singapore. Sort them in order, plot a distribution curve and find the 95th percentile.

I can likely find values of what’s the average spin put onto the ball by a pro-golfer.

Note: I’m using pro golfer statistics to make it even less likely to happen. The additional factors of 1.5 to wind speed and power likely increases the value for calculation to even exceed the highest possible value (even by professional standards).

The newest one at Marina Bay was pretty much built at a time before the entire place was developed too (opened a good 4 years before MBS was). The govt pretty much had to wait until the leases to expire on the older courses to force the clubs to give up their land for redevelopment.

As for entertainment, golf courses are a luxury amenities - so sure, they entertain less people, but the clientele they draw are likely to spend a *lot* more in comparison - and that's not counting the soft effects of businessmen or political leaders hammering out informal deals on the golf courses.

Edit: Let me add on. All too many people (older generation especially) love the idea of lowered taxes and monetary handouts because it’s present; a tangible. The intangibles from increased taxes or money spent by the government include - but not limited to - funding poor children and their education (overall benefit to society as they grow up to better contribute), better infrastructure and roads for the country (imagine shelter and better walkways, lowering risk of accidents and danger). 

Not to mention, the government saving our money for us. How many people can you safely say would save for retirement or would have sufficient to tide through Covid? Unless you think the $1200 the government handed out was from its ass, and not the taxes we’ve been paying?

919,17,g9qw8hc,t1_g9qrkgb,"Precisely. My point was never to defend the club management. My aim was to highlight to the people in the thread that it is entirely possible to make theoretical calculations within reasonable limits in reality. 

All these people (I presume non STEM) dismiss these calculations with non-backed nor any argument even remotely legitimate. 

Just look at what u/JosephineTeo wrote. Wind can change direction, shove it up your ass. Wind cannot stop the ball. 

I was merely pointing out it doesn’t take a smart person to calculate. In life, isn’t it modus operandi to assume worse case scenarios and design your approach based off that? 

This is evident even in the elevators you take. Average male is maybe 75-80kg, females at 50-60. Yet when you look at the recommended weight in these they propose for a maximum of 10 people, with a total allowable weight of more than 1500kg. That’s nearly twice the average and unlikely to be crossed even if you factor in baggage.

Another example would be designing of buildings. This aligns closely with my field of study. For example, the government’s code and regulations demands you to design for the worse case scenario where you assume the building and beams are fully loaded. Although we all know the carpark will never be entirely full. 

At the end of the day, Science is largely accurate to a certain extent. The Scientific method has, and always will be the way of progress for human civilization. When the general public becomes ignorant and dismissive of Science and Engineering, you get the situation in US.",t3_jgb39r,23-10-2020

The restaurants are still open, but we all know that not all of them will survive the lockdown and the eventual Economic Great Depression (forget about what people said about the looming economic crises as nothing more than recession, we **are** going into the same circumstances that gave rise to the 1930 Great Depression, and may God help us if that does not turn into an impetus for a nation to go to war to another country on the basis of ""reliving the glory of our past Empire""), so expect all the shops to be shuttered or reduced in size.

I think the worst is that, because airports suddenly become irrelevant in the wake of hyper-hyperlocalisation (the desire to make everything locally available, for goods and services that you normally require an overseas merchant to bring in) except cargo.

Even at sea, away from territorial waters, some maneuvers can be considered as attacks, without the need to fire anything at another boat. So, yes, this has been agreed upon upstream, very probably :-). Note that Singapore and France have been working together for a long time [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France%E2%80%93Singapore\_relations#Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France%E2%80%93Singapore_relations#Defence) .

More interestingly, I think the closest thing to the ""diplomatic immunity"" you're suggesting is the right of ""innocent passage"" (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocent\_passage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocent_passage) ), a right that allows one nation to make its warships transit through another nation's territorial waters with conditions. Typically: a non NATO navy transiting through the Channel will have to shut down all its weapons systems (and will probably be escorted by a french or UK navy vessel anyway, like [https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-37735436/russian-warships-pass-through-english-channel](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-37735436/russian-warships-pass-through-english-channel) ).",t3_bv1bcu,31-05-2019
1089,17,epo3vy2,t1_epldd0u,"Visiting submarines typically give quite a few days' notice before coming, for a few good reasons.

1) Arranging for naval escort: International protocol for visiting submarines involves surfacing before entering another country's waters, so that they don't present a threat to the host country. Surfaced submarines are very vulnerable and usually require a naval escort by the host country as they make their way from the border to port. More commonly though, the submarines travel as part of a group and may have their own escorts.

2) Available berths in port:
For practical and security reasons, advanced notice is necessary to secure particular berths for subs, where they'll be less exposed to prying eyes or (however unlikely) sabotage.

3) Diplomacy/national & base security:
It's simply good diplomatic etiquette to let your host country know before you sail a sub into their waters, especially if it's laden with a nuclear reactor or nuclear warheads. Base personnel must be very aware of the latter so that they can carry out containment protocol if there's a radioactive incident.",t3_bv1bcu,31-05-2019

Alongside the lead designers Grant Associates, the design team for Bay South included WilkinsonEyre, Atelier Ten (environmental design consultants) and Atelier One (structural engineers).

&#x200B;

If they do I'd be helluva interested in their filtration plant since biofouling will be a real issue unless they scrub the return water super clean both physically and chemically.

At the volumes they are dealing with, it would be quite a thing to eyeball.

I can't imagine how many kilowatts the pumps they need to run this waterfall eat per hour.

The other issue is probably humidity. I'm pretty sure they have special high capacity dehumidifiers in service.",t3_az20fl,10-03-2019

1594,17,ek6utat,t1_ek6pza6,"Well, squadrons with 2 as the first number are control squadrons, they communicate and direct aircraft. The difference is in the location and type of control done. 208 does control from the tower, bringing aircraft to and from parking areas, control how they move to the runway and as well as bring landing aircraft back in. 203 does area control (overhead in Singapore), they're like a standard ATC role, except for military aircraft. 

So when an aircraft starts up, tower control brings them safely to the runway and directs the take off. After it has departed the airspace controlled by the aerodrome, it's handed over to area control, which will direct the aircraft around/to it's destination. And when it comes back to land, area control will hand the aircraft back to tower control to be brought back in to land. 

The actual process is a little more complicated than that, but that's basically what control squadrons do in a nutshell. The civilian equivalent would be that tall tower with the ball on top at Changi Airport (tower control), and the main ATC controllers bringing aircraft out of and around Singapore airspace (Area control). Hope that helps in your understanding!

1598,17,ek72rza,t1_ek6utat,"So basically you're CAAS for military aircraft? Why separate military and civil aviation control anyway? In that role you're trying to prevent planes from crashing into one another, and separating control between military and civilian planes seems to me to increase the risk of a military plane hitting a civilian plane. This might be analogous to the crashes between US Navy destroyers and civilian boats that occurred last year, but I could be wrong about that.

Changi V is awesome (even after ORD I still drag the family there when we're at the airport). But the great Loyang Ave jam easily adds 30 mins to your commute if you leave any time after 5 (which is pretty much every day). Meanwhile the East shuttle bus means you have an excuse to leave work earlier and get to the MRT faster which made a big difference to a Westie like me. Also less SAF bullshit at East - the ppl there seem more concerned with doing their actual jobs of flying and maintaining planes than bureaucratic nonsense. At least in my job at west it is more likely you'd have to deal with the daily whims of the OC/CO/Base Comm/HQs.

Their focus would be mainly on bringing civil flights in and out of our international airport. Having the civil side handles military flights would stretch their resources as well as their manpower. Military flights have different rules, restrictions and paths compared to the civil flights and splitting their task between the two would not be easy. There are flight routes and height blocks that have been coordinated between the civil and military agencies and the other side would be informed of any potential deviations. 

I can't really comment on the culture or work done in the west side but I believe both parts do their job well and come together to make all our important operations happen.

> SINGAPORE — One restaurant has resorted to creating a special “midnight high tea” menu, while some outlets have tried to close early despite the risk of being fined by Changi Airport Group.

> Restaurants on level five of Jewel Changi Airport are required to remain open until 3am daily, but they are having issues meeting this condition because they have few or no customers after midnight.

> The restaurants' managers believe there are two reasons for this: What they have on their menus and their location on the topmost level — this means their patrons are either visitors to the Canopy Park, which opened on Monday (June 10), or people who would not mind going out of their way to visit restaurants in that part of Jewel.

> The Canopy Park's opening hours are 9am till 3am. From July 10, some attractions will close at 10pm, but others will continue to stay open till 3am.

> A Jewel Changi Airport Development spokesperson told TODAY in a statement on Thursday: “With the recent opening of the Canopy Park attractions, the operating hours of the leisure offerings, including the eight restaurants at the topmost level of Jewel, are aligned and open from 9am to 3am. This is testament of our commitment to strengthen the extended-hour offerings in Jewel. We will continue to review our operations and engage our tenants closely.”

> The level five restaurant operators told TODAY they are not hopeful that the Canopy Park will bring in more late-night business for them. One, who declined to be named, said visitors to the Canopy Park were there specifically to visit the park, and another, who also requested anonymity, felt park visitors would not be inclined to visit the restaurants in the wee hours.

> Desperate to attract more customers in the wee hours, Arteastiq, one of the eight restaurants on level five, tried to be creative by coming up with a new offering — but to no avail.

> Branch manager Alvin Lim said: “We can only serve appetisers after midnight and we came up with the midnight high tea menu to resolve this problem. It is available from 10pm to 3am but there are still no customers despite this.”

> He added: “We hardly see customers coming in after midnight and I have submitted feedback to higher management a week ago. I think we do not need to open the restaurant until 3am.”

> He also observed that neighbouring tenants often close two hours before the stipulated time of 3am. Staff at restaurants on level five, who told TODAY they close before 3am, declined to go on the record.

> Managers of some restaurants on level five told TODAY that they have received warning letters from the airport’s management for closing early — one has received three.

> Some restaurants, such as popular luxe-casual Burger & Lobster, have also begun negotiations with Jewel, in the hope of shortening the opening hours.

> A spokesman said: “Opening hours are set by contract, but we are trying to negotiate with Jewel. Opening till 3am is a drain on the business because after 1am, there is nothing, there is nobody. At most, only one customer comes in every half an hour which, operational-wise, is not worth it.”

> MANPOWER ISSUES

> Out of the seven eateries that responded to TODAY’s queries, six say the long opening hours are a problem. They cited manpower shortages and resource wastage as key issues.

> Arteastiq’s Mr Lim said: “Labour costs for working past midnight and transportation fees for my staff are very expensive.”

> Ms Kelly D’Cruz, the manager of modern Japanese restaurant Tanuki Raw, has had trouble hiring staff to work the late hours.

> She said: “Few people want to work the night shift as it can be disruptive to their body clock. As a business we have to pay additional overtime as well as the transport costs which add up very quickly. One of the bigger concerns is the morale impact it has when working the night shift.”

> The only restaurant that is doing well in the wee hours is Rumours Bar & Grill, which is the only outlet on the fifth level that is allowed to sell alcoholic drinks past midnight.

> Miss Olivia Walker, its manager, said: “Normally, half or more of the seats are filled up on weekday nights, even past midnight.”

> TODAY understands that some restaurants such as Prive and Tiger Beer Street Lab sell only non-alcoholic drinks past midnight because their liquor licences expire at midnight.

> Food critic and consultant K F Seetoh raised issues about the opening hours at Jewel last month in a Facebook post, before the Canopy Park opened.

> “I was there (at Jewel) same time today, pre-opening hours at 9.30am, same as three weeks back and the lines then were ridiculous. But it's all but disappeared now. I see the usual crowds closer to opening and regular hours, which is normal and I hope it continues. The decline is slow and real. I feel for the tenants, especially the 24/7 ones.”

> MIXED RESPONSE AT BASEMENT TWO

> The picture is more mixed for restaurants opening late in other parts of Jewel.

> Checks on Jewel Changi Airport's website indicate that of the 111 eateries, 44 are open for business past midnight.

> Of these, 33 dining outlets, including well-known brands such as Old Chang Kee, Twelve Cupcakes, Burger King, Mr Bean and Stuff'd, are open 24/7.

> Fast food chain KFC in basement two sometimes stays open beyond its midnight closing time because customers are still coming in, restaurant manager Hu Jia Li said. “This could be because the food is more affordable here (compared to the ones on the fifth level),” she added.

> Although Jewel Changi Airport's website states that Four Seasons Durians Restaurant — also in basement two — is open 24/7, a restaurant spokesperson clarified that it is open from 11am to 11pm from Sunday to Thursday. It extends its opening hours to 2am on Friday and Saturday to accommodate customers who want to stay later, the spokesperson added.

> However, there are generally very few customers past midnight, and many of their neighbouring restaurants do not stay open 24/7 as well, the spokesperson said.

> Several businesses on basement two told TODAY that few, if any, customers patronise their outlets past midnight.

I think many people expect better foot traffic but it's not happening. If restaurants are making money nobody will be complaining now isn't it? 

The key issue is should Jewel still insist restaurants open until 3am at the long term detriment of the health + relationship of its tenants when there is clearly no demand. Maybe it is a chicken and  egg thing where you open long enough there'll be supper crowd recognizing Jewel as a good place for late night food eventually, but if that's the case even Jewel can say mark down rents when footfall is below certain number to help tank the cost of operation of its own tenants.

> I'm sure chains like Burger and Lobster are still quite profitable. 

You might be surprised. Many of the big names are actually barely profitable but they make good money overall by having many many branches/franchise. 

But anyway, if overall they're profitable I'm sure the tenants won't kpkb so much. We'll only know when given a longer runway and see who lives or dies lor.

There are people who are xenophobic, and then there are those who are not. The point is, not all who speak up are xenophobes, even if all xenophobes will speak up. To visualise on a venn diagram(?), draw two circles, one inside the other. The small circle represents the xenophobes, the larger circle represents the people who speaks up. Bad generalisation and simplification of a complex problem, making things black and white when it is not, for the sake of *appearing* socially progressive is, to put it nicely, bad.

To discuss this issue is not necessarily xenophobia. There are considerations and logical reasoning why we should help Singaporeans too.

The first and foremost responsibility of every government is to its people, whom their authority is derived from. Therefore, it is needless to say that it is the *duty* of the government to take care of their citizens, to ensure they receive sufficient opportunities. Every other country is running on a similar principle. Opportunities should and will be given to their own citizens first. It should not be the case that foreigners could get *better* opportunities here as compared to their own home country, like what Mr Ang had mentioned with the French CEO example.

Think of it, can we mass migrate to France and expect to secure a better job than what we could have secured in SG, especially at the expense of the French? It will never happen. Can we even mass migrate to India in reverse CECA and monopolise their largest companies and bring a whole kampong over? If Singaporeans cannot receive better opportunities elsewhere and at home, we lose out.

In an attempt to reduce “discrimination” and pat ourself on the shoulders for “social justice”, we simply discriminate ourselves. Given that “social equality” as advocated by many SJW is to remove “privileges” by discriminating *everybody* in some form or another, I don’t think we should jump on this illogical dystopic bandwagon.

Social justice, social equality, and social progress need not be a race to the bottom. We don’t need to level the playing field by pulling people down. We need to level the playing field by pulling everyone *up*. 

We should not counter xenophobia by reducing citizen privileges so that FTs can seemingly have a level playing field, only for them to later take advantage and abuse our generosity and make us second class citizens in our own homes, denied by them the fair opportunities which we had given to them in the first place. We can keep citizen privileges and protect our people, while offering opportunities for foreign talents to come here and work for better opportunities.

FT want to come, they can come. Just make sure this is limited by how much we can offer, so that both Singaporeans and FTs can prosper. If we shouldn’t go one way to cater for one group by banning or severely limiting FTs, then we *must not* go the other by over-offering at our expense!

An FT without a job here can simply go somewhere else. A Singaporean without a job can only go and eat grass. That is one of the key important thing to consider. If we institute regulations that might lead to some limitations imposed on FTs, are we really affecting their opportunities? Can they not seek similar opportunities elsewhere? After all, they are mobile professionals. But, if we are to limit *our own opportunities* for the benefit of FTs, can we expect to seek similar opportunities elsewhere? Are we mobile?

If we don’t significantly infringe on the opportunities of others, while simultaneously significantly increase the opportunities for our own, I don’t know about you, but I think that is a good thing to do. We need to strike a balance and put a stop to the present unregulated situation that had been abused for the past decade! This is not a win-win situation, it is a win-lose situation, a catalyst for destroying social progress. 

And for those who are concerned about xenophobia, understand this, had the situation not devolve to a win-lose situation at our people’s expense, there would not be so much traction. Historically worldwide, those who support such ideologies are people who have suffered much grievances. There is no smoke without fire. If you want to remove the smoke, then extinguish the fire!

I wonder how many hatemails I am going to get this time. The last time I talked about those high paying expats, I got a bunch of hatemails from some rather privileged people or kids who never seemed to face any of the hardships the common people might need to endure.",t3_ijv7n4,01-09-2020

2150,17,g3g8xvp,t3_ijv7n4,"> # PAP MP Ang Wei Neng on visit to Changi Business Park: 'I felt like a foreigner in my own country'

> In his parliamentary speech on August 31, West Coast GRC MP Ang Wei Neng suggested setting up a National Human Resource Committee.

> He began his speech by recounting an experience he had at Changi Business Park. Ang had gone there prior to Covid-19.

> When he entered a lift, he noticed that the ""well-dressed"" people around him were ""apparently foreigners"" and speaking in a language foreign to Ang.

> Ang said it was the first time he had felt ""like a foreigner in my own country"".

> Why though?

> Ang questioned why this might be, especially with recent assurances that nearly six in 10 in the workforce are locals — a number which Ang acknowledges is among the highest in the world.

> Ang then pointed to the high number of Employment Pass and S-Pass holders.

> ""When I checked the MOM’s statistics, I noted there were 193,700 Employment Pass holder or E-Pass holders and 200,000 S-Pass holders as of December 2019. Why are there so many?""

> Ang theorised that the low fertility rate might be the reason for this.

> 30 years ago, Singapore's Total Fertility Rate was 1.8 per female, while it now stands at 1.1. The need to supplement that lost workforce meant more foreign workers.

> Ang, however, said that while this was acceptable during good times, these aren't good times.

> He pointed to the high unemployment rate, and how Singaporeans would be unhappy if they lose their jobs while foreigners held on to PMET jobs. He thus agreed with President Halimah that this is the top national priority.

> While Ang praised what is currently being done, he emphasises the need to do more.

> What to do?

> So what more can be done?

> Ang emphasised that protecting the Singapore core should not end even when the economy recovers. This core should be safeguarded across all industries, and not just the financial sector, he added.

> Ang then raised the question of whether it was ""too easy for foreign talents to work in Singapore"".

> He talked about his own experience as the CEO of a private company, and how often he had to collaborate with tech companies, banks, financial institutions and other MNCs.

> Ang highlighted one particular instance where he was having lunch with the head of a delivery company, a subsidiary of a MNC headquartered in Germany, who was a Frenchman in his 30s.

> The Frenchman told Ang that it would be difficult for him to find a similar opportunity in France due to the high unemployment rate.

> The Frenchman continued by saying that many of his expat friends felt the same way, that it was easier for them to look for a good job in Singapore.

> Ang, acknowledging that his experience was anecdotal, said his main point was how he believed Singaporeans can fill these regional or senior management positions which are currently filled by foreigners.

> Singapore cannot be nationalistic of inward-looking

> Ang then took a look at what other countries were doing to help their own people.

> He touched on Australia's abolishment of the 457 visa programme in 2018, as well as the suspension of foreign worker visas by the United States earlier this year.

> Neither of these two outcomes were considered ideal by Ang.

> He emphasises that being nationalistic or inward-looking is not the way forward for Singapore. Singapore needs to remain competitive, and preferential treatment can often be detrimental towards a country's prospects.

> But more importantly, Singaporeans should be given the opportunities to compete.

> Ang argued against the stance of zero intervention and letting market forces dictate employment, or on the other extreme, forcing a Singaporean core without much thought about competency or fit.

> Ang claims there is a middle ground of “soft power” and gentle persuasion, where the government works together with businesses to jointly ""seed the appeal"" of developing a Singaporean Core, and explore how this can best be done.

> National Human Resources Committee

> Which brings us to Ang's suggestion.

> A National Human Resource Committee, working through the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs).

> The ITMs are roadmaps to be developed for 23 industries to address issues within each industry and deepen partnerships between Government, firms, industries, trade associations and chambers.

> This National HR Committee could work through the six sub-committees under the Future Economy Council, which oversees ITM developments, to take into account the development of a Singaporean Core.

> There will be three main objectives of setting up the National HR committee.

> 1. Sending a strong signal

> The National HR Committee can have regular meetings with the Heads of HR from major companies in Singapore to understand their main manpower issues and their commitment in building a Singaporean core in the management team.

> Whether the head of HR of major companies is helmed by a Singaporean is also a reflection of their dedication to build a Singaporean core, according to Ang.

> Whether the company is “major” would be defined in terms of specific turnover, profit and/or number of staff.

> 2. Gathering and sharing data to create an effective platform to discuss meaningful strategies

> Gathering data on PMET workforce composition will give early warning indicators before the situation gets out of hand.

> To back this up, Ang cited a previous case of Employment pass and S-Pass holders, outnumbering local PMETs.

> The majority of the firms were from the financial and professional services sectors.

> 3. Active dissemination of best practices

> The HR committee can work with companies to to share best practices for developing a Singaporean core at the middle and top management levels.

> Ang said that over time, the National HR Committee could then develop guidelines and blueprint based on best practices for different industries.

> Ang gave the example that if a company has a regional HQ in Singapore, they should have a plan to give their Singaporean executives regional exposure.

> This might open up opportunities for promotion later on as well as provide regional or global exposure, exposure which Ang noted Singaporeans tend to lack.

------

Number of Singapore citizens who are unemployed as of 2019: 63,900 (3.3%)

https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/UnemploymentTimeSeries.aspx

Let's assume that Singaporeans do not want FDW or construction jobs at all. For further simplicity, let's assume Singaporeans do not want any of the other Work Permit jobs done by the 443,900. Let's ignore the other work passes too.

That leaves 193,700 + 200,000 EP and S Pass jobs. 



Even if every single unemployed Singaporean citizen was given a job regardless of their qualifications / suitability  by replacing one of the EP or S Pass holders, it would still leave 329,800 jobs for EPs / S Passes.  This will bring the unemployment rate to 0% which is both [economically terrible](https://www.thebalance.com/natural-rate-of-unemployment-definition-and-trends-3305950) and is almost never seen in any other country (even the ones most opposed to immigration).",t3_ijv7n4,31-08-2020

2291,17,dtnkovv,t1_dtnetgc,"Well, its common knowledge most Singaporean parents discipline their kids without wanting to understand why their kids did an 'undesirable' action in the first place. 

I believe most adults have lost touch with experiences of their earlier childhood that they fail to acknowledge children are capable of complex thinking and proper (but infantile) decision making. So they assume all children are simple minded beings incapable of making decisions for themselves.

This brings us to your comment.

Singaporean parents do understand the huge emotional and financial and physical 'investment' required to raise a child. Furthermore, such parents are stressed out from their jobs and it is also a widely known fact that Singaporeans are **a bunch of cynics**. 

This puts kids in a situation where they do not have any chance to give an in depth explaination of their actions and to also be taken seriously. Singaporean parents rather beat their child, take out their stress on them and also reinforce the idea that making them worry is bad and they should never do it again because a good kid doesnt worry his/parents.

It is the simplest and easiest catch-all method to the typical stressed out, cynical Singaporean parent and human beings favor the path of least resistance. If raising your kid doesnt go smoothly, most of the time you resort to beating him/her in order to smoothen things out because finding the root of the problem is harder than simply taking out your frustration on your child.

Get it? Ive experienced all this first hand and I sure wont want my future child to go through what Ive gone through.

TL;DR: Flustered, stressed out parents are more likely to beat a child because he/she went missing. Chances increase if he has a history of mischief or problems. Strong beliefs of sparing the rod will spoil the child are commonplace and it is easier to associate bad/unpredictable behaviour to pain rather than find the root of the problem and nip it in the bud.

> SINGAPORE: An aircraft that was taking part in the Singapore Airshow caught fire following an accident at Changi Airport on Tuesday (Feb 6) afternoon.  

> The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said that at 1.24pm, an aircraft from the [Black Eagles aerobatic team](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/south-korea-s-black-eagles-3-things-to-know-8171654) from the Republic of Korea Air Force skidded and crashed into the grass verge at the side of Changi Airport&apos;s Runway 1 and caught fire. 

> The aircraft was taking off for the flying display programme at the Singapore Airshow when the incident happened, CAAS said. 

> ""The pilot sustained light injuries and is being treated,"" it added. 

> In an advisory posted on its Facebook page, Changi Aiport Group (CAG) said that the airport&apos;s emergency service put out the fire. 

> Runway 1 is closed until further notice, CAG added. 

> It said in a subsequent update that ""a number of departure and arrival flights will be delayed over the next few hours"". 

> ""Passengers are advised to check the latest flight information on changiairport.com or iChangi app. Our customer service teams are on ground to provide assistance if needed,"" said CAG. 

> ""We apologise for any inconvenience caused."" 

> According to a report from Yonhap News Agency, the South Korean Air Force said ""the pilot remains safe"" and an investigation was launched to find out the cause of the accident, as well as the potential damage. 

> Eyewitness Gerald Searle, 51, was at the airport waiting for his flight to Australia when he saw the accident. 

> ""I saw the plane spin sideways, flip over and then slide down the runway upside down,"" said Mr Searle. ""It burst into flames, though most at the rear."" 

> This story is developing. Please refresh for updates.

It’s bound to happen from time to time due to a wide variety of factors beyond one’s control. Managing the delay is more important as compared to whining about it. Furthermore, Paya Lebar airstrip is a military base and Seletar’s runway isn’t long enough for large jets to land.

This could also have happened to a commercial airliner as well, with far greater consequences. 1 incident in 10 years for the airshow is just Murphy's Law at play.

As to hosting foreign forces on home military airbases, I don't think any of us are in the position to judge the viability of that option. ",t3_7vltpi,07-02-2018

2418,17,dtuuzag,t1_dtuixu9,"You're right. My bad. They are moving Paya Lebar Air Base to Changi Air Base, which means the Changi Airport area would see a civilian airport and a military air base utilising the same runways.",t3_7vltpi,07-02-2018
2419,17,dtu27na,t1_dtu19re,"Yep. But I was comparing other busier airports that only had two runways, and the reason for only having two, is due to the airport being in close proximity to city/residential areas. 

Singapore built Changi at the eastern tip of the island specifically so that if expansion is needed, we can simply reclaim land, instead of having to demolish houses. Much of Changi Airport right now is on reclaimed land.",t3_7vltpi,06-02-2018
2420,17,dtvoiw7,t1_dtv14in,"Glad the pilot is okay. And glad the plane crashed without harming other commercial liners. Sharing a runway with the Changi Exhibition Centre would not have been on the spotlight, as it was for the last decade, but it was on the spotlight during the past 24 hours. No one could have expected that accident, but it could have been prevented. 

At this point, what I'm curious to know about are the damages that were incurred, as a result of closing one of the runways. News reports are saying 170 flights got delayed. That virtually never happens in Changi. I can imagine it will be expensive and I can't really tell if Changi is footing the bill or not, since it's been downplayed in the news.

We also understand that incidents like these have a very low likelihood of occurring and there is hardly a legitimate reason to make such a fuss about it. Senai airport to the north is always available to you if you fear a repeat of this whole episode during next year's airshow, although you'll face a greatly reduced selection of flights.

I just actually experienced it firsthand and was seeking to understand the decision making process an airport like Changi goes through in that scenario and thought to voice that opinion here to see if there was any support for that view.   My first post was written mostly in annoyance in the moment after a 5 hour delay.  So fair enough if that is viewed as a whinge.

Subsequent posts have been measured and neutral. I still haven't heard a half decent answer except for what falls into 'you're whingeing' or making a fuss. In other forums there are a lot of very annoyed people. Maybe this isn't that forum, and maybe only when smthg directly affects people as I said earlier will they then voice support or annoyance for something. MRT failure  is a good example which when compared is similar or more benign and will drive fury on this thread. ",t3_7vltpi,07-02-2018

>So the way it works is this:  
>  
>Most  of the plants out there have something called a flare, which is not  normally in use. They do have combustion going on, but it is not an  exposed flame, and what is being burned is done in a controlled manner  and they have some processes after the burning to limit the amount of  pollutants and green gas houses.  
>  
>However,  sometimes because of some system upset, the product they are making, or  some of the intermediates (what gets made on the way to make the  product) is of bad quality. If the volume is large or if they have a no  blending policy (mixing good product with bad until becomes average  product) or for any other big reason they simply can't keep the product  or sell it, they burn it off in their flare. this is an open flame, at  the top of a pretty high stack. Depending on the plant size, production  volume, type of material, etc. you can end up with a very large and  bright flame.  
>  
>Plants hate flaring  because you are burning away material, which is a waste of money, and  because they have to pay a fine as they are releasing a lot more  pollutants and green house gases than usual/allotted volume.  So it si  quite rare to see flares (unless the company sucks, in which case they  won't be open for long/under the same management) and I think this is  most likely the case.

I think the issue here is Seletar Airport best serves only a niche market - people who don't have problems commuting there *and* who actually fly to destinations connected to Seletar. It's receiving the same criticism right now as what London City Airport started out receiving, but the criticism died down after infrastructural improvements rolled in and regional subsidiaries of the big airlines rolled in to provide super convenient connections.

But Seletar's 200m walk from cab to gate is similar to the 10- to 15-min jaunt from the DLR station to the gate at LCY, so after the transportation infrastructure around Seletar is beefed up, and the variety of destinations connected to Seletar is beefed up, we could be on to something.",t3_esjj27,23-01-2020

Caning is a widely used form of corporal punishment in Singapore. It can be divided into several contexts: judicial, prison, reformatory, military, school, and domestic or private. These practices of caning are largely a legacy of, and are influenced by, British colonial rule in Singapore. Similar forms of corporal punishment are also used in some other former British colonies, including two of Singapore's neighbouring countries, Malaysia and Brunei.

2628,17,ey73ba4,t3_cvwzq1,"This may not be a very popular opinion here, but this is evidence that any tightening of regulations must be done carefully, or workers will find themselves without little employment prospects. 

Anyone who wants to reduce tobacco and liquor consumption in Singapore with regulation must be prepared to mitigate the resultant negative effects. Likewise, anyone calling for greater environmental regulation on our industries (like oil and gas) should also understand that mitigation steps need to be taken to ensure Singaporeans don't lose their jobs. Just because these jobs are predominantly blue-collar doesn't make those doing them any less worthy of consideration and help. 

In the case of DFS, this is a minor disruption to the retail industry and I am sure those currently employed will be easily reemployable. But for something major like environmental regulation, it is much harder to reemploy an entire industry (energy and chemicals accounts for 7% of our GDP). 

I'm not saying we shouldn't do anything. I'm saying we need to take measured steps and constantly ensure disrupted workers can find worthwhile employment. No one wants to be unemployed for life just because they chose the ""wrong"" industry.",t3_cvwzq1,27-08-2019

SINGAPORE - The DFS Group which has been selling liquor and tobacco  at Changi Airport for close to 40 years is pulling out, The Straits  Times has learnt.

Its duty-free stores will close in June 2020, when the current lease expires, to make way for a new player.

Hundreds of staff are expected to lose their jobs.

In an unexpected development, Changi's biggest and oldest tenant has  confirmed that it did not bid for a new concession. The tender exercise  closed on Monday (Aug 26).

Changi Airport Group's spokesman Ivan Tan told ST: ""DFS Group is a  valued partner whom we have worked with at Changi Airport for the past  38 years.

""We are disappointed that they have opted not to participate in this  tender but we will work closely with them to ensure a smooth transition  to the new operator for the liquor and tobacco concession.""

In a statement issued to media, DFS group chairman and chief  executive officer Ed Brennan said: ""After careful consideration, DFS has  decided not to bid to retain the liquor and tobacco concession  operations at Changi Airport.

""Our decision not to bid was based on our unique understanding of the  business environment as the current operator of this concession at  Changi.

""Specifically, changing regulations concerning the sale of liquor and  tobacco, against a global context of geopolitical uncertainty, meant  that staying in Changi was not a financially viable option.""

Singapore has been [tightening rules on liquor and tobacco consumption](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-budget-2019-smaller-duty-free-alcohol-allowance-and-gst-relief-for-overseas), affecting retailers like DFS, industry players said.

The changes will apply to all tobacco products, including cigarettes,  cigarillos, cigars, beedies, ang hoon and other roll-your-own tobacco  products, the ministry said.

Mr Brennan added: ""Although this decision is the right one for our  business, it was not taken lightly. DFS has held the concession at  Changi Airport since 1980, and during this time we have exceeded all  expectations for what travel retail can offer in an airport environment.

""We are proud of our achievements and deeply appreciative of the  efforts of many talented people who have contributed to our success.

Doesn’t help that American’s propaganda animations also uses “jap” constantly beside a downright insulting portrayal of a Japanese soldier (*partially to mitigate the terrifying reputation they had during the early parts of the war*).

It doesn't matter that you don't *intend* to be racist, you need to realize that the N word is more than just some racist word that white people made up to talk about black people. There's a history of oppression, racism, abuse, and hatred around this word. Would you say it to a black person and explain that you didn't *intend* for it to be racist but rather you were just being cute and joking around?

Saying ""faggot"" does't mean you hate gay people anymore; saying ""cuck"" doesn't refer to a man who has been cuckolded anymore.

The N word has changed its form and the sooner we accept it the quicker we can accept that blacks are people. If we can all happily use the N word, it means the past is the past and we can all move on.

Again, as I said, the definitions tend to be dodgy. How do you draw intent? My definition requires the person to be perfectly honest, which is not practical given human nature.",t3_af70tx,12-01-2019

2757,17,g4br1iv,t3_intdxl,"This CAG chairman? He acts like a gangster!!! I used to work in changi airport's info counter, and there was this particular incident of the CAG chairman that put him in very bad light among us info counter staff. Just a bit of background, info counter is managed by Pserv Kelly Services (we're outsourced) and CAG is our client.

There was a guy who came to the info counter and asked my colleague why didn't he stop a kid from playing with the trolley / some scooter (by right its not allowed in airport because it might cause accidents) but we normally dont stop kids because these days parents are so protective of their kids and service staff like us get scolded for doing our job. So my colleague went and asked the kid nicely to stop, then he went back to the info counter and saw that the guy that came to the counter also has an airport pass, making him an airport staff too. So my colleague said something along the lines of if he is an airport staff, he can also play a part to make changi airport a better place by asking the kid to stop as well. It doesnt have to be info counter staff, because CAG always advocate ""one changi"". (So much so that they have this huge poster showing awards given to teams of mixure airport staffs from different companies at staff entrances). Then this guy got triggered and shouted at my colleague saying ""so now I ask you to do your job you dont want to do lah?"" Then he left the counter.

A few moments later he came back and brought another guy with him. Then the other guy stared at my colleague and asked, ""Do you know who I am?"" Then proceed throw his namecard and scream in his face that he is the chairman of CAG. Then berated my colleague that he doesnt want to do his job, and he saw my colleague's nametag and shouted in his face like an ahbeng ""You singaporean or not? YOU SINGAPOREAN OR NOT? YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO VIETNAM?"" (Btw the chairman himself is not born Singaporean, so playing the nationality card is really wtf)

One of my manager from Pserv tried to fight for my colleague, he didnt do anything wrong, was professional throughout, didnt raise his voice at the chairman etc so we thought he had a fighting chance because theres cctv at the info counter and a mic as well (YES, microphones are installed at ALL info counters) but CAG locked all the footages and recordings so my manager cannot access them. Not sure if they were deleted. In the end my colleague lost his job, he was asked to sign a warning letter but he refused and he was straight up fired. This happened around 2 years back. From then on, every info counter in airport has a piece of paper with the CAG Chairman and CEOs' faces printed on it. We have to memorise them. Talk about elitism.

When this news came up, some of us info counter staff talked about it. We have no doubts the maid is innocent.  By the way, the first guy that came to the counter and asked my colleague to stop the kid from playing the trolley/scooter is the CAG chairman's PERSONAL DRIVER. I remember some other staff questioned how come the personal driver who is not working in the airport has an airport pass that can grant him access to transit areas in the airport? And mind you, to have an airport pass, screenings are needed frm SPF to ensure you are working in airport etc. So are false records submitted by the CAG to SPF? Or SPF knows the driver is just working for the chairman and not at the airport? The staff that asked this question was rebutted with ""he is the chairman, he can do whatever he wants. If you become his daughter in law and ask for an airport pass you can get it too."" 

Im risking myself to put this on the internet about the chairman. And this is not the only story of his rotten personality. I heard quite a few from CAG interns too. So please, guys, come out with your side of stories and unfairness that this CAG chairman subjected people to. And pray for me that I dont get sued LOL.

2780,17,g4b8bw0,t1_g4b4o6b,"My two cents ah:

1) Chances are that Singapore's rich and influential will be the first point of contact with the rich and influential from other parts of the world. A rich and influential individual with poor moral and ethics may cause a poor first impression and send the wrong signal of Singapore and Singaporeans to others.

2) Singapore is seen as an clean, transparent, and honest society that is very favourable to do business.  Unethical behaviour and possible perjury (as in the Liews' case) can spoil our reputation, especially because Liew Mun Leong is after all Chairman of CAG. No one wants to do business with a company led by someone with no morals and poor reputation. Or in a country where the rich and influential can do whatever they like.

3) Worsen divisions between the rich and the ordinary, especially if they aren't held accountable. The perception that the rich and influential can get away with their misdeeds could rise, and the average Singaporean's contempt towards the wealthy and powerful may worsen. We're already seeing class divide in Singapore worsen, I don't think any of us wants this to boil over into civil unrest based on class differences. So all the more the need for additional scrutiny, to make sure that the rich and influential are kept in line.

The rich and influential are often closely linked to Singapore's national interests. CAG operates Changi Airport, a great source of Singaporean pride and vital to the Singapore economy. We shouldn't have people that are willing to stoop to such underhanded means be responsible for key sectors of Singapore, or even become unofficial ambassadors of Singapore, only to 'throw face'.",t3_intdxl,07-09-2020

> SINGAPORE: A court has awarded S$326,620 in damages to the estate of a woman who died after winning a court battle with Changi General Hospital (CGH), which was found liable for negligence in its delay of her lung cancer diagnosis.

> In her judgment on Tuesday (Jan 19), Justice Belinda Ang awarded S$304,000 as general damages to the estate of Ms Noor Azlin Abdul Rahman, including for pain, suffering, loss of amenity and dependency claims, and another S$22,620 for special damages including medical expenses.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> As CGH has already paid an interim sum of S$200,000, it will have to pay only the balance.

> Justice Ang found that CGH's negligence had caused Ms Azlin's eventual death at the age of 39, dismissing the hospital's argument that there was no guarantee that Ms Azlin would have been completely cured even with timely treatment.

> Ms Azlin won her court case against CGH in February 2019 after an appeal, but died weeks later in April. She was suffering from fourth-stage lung cancer.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The apex court found in February 2019 that CGH was in breach of its duty of care owed to Ms Azlin by failing to have in place a proper system for adequate follow-up of radiological results and patient management.

> This resulted in a delay in diagnosing her with lung cancer.

> Ms Azlin first visited CGH in 2007, where a doctor assessed after three X-rays that an opacity in her chest appeared to be resolving or had resolved on its own.

> Ms Azlin returned to CGH twice in 2010 and 2011, with chest X-rays performed and follow-ups recommended for the opacity in her chest, but none was carried out.

> Advertisement

> It was only when she was referred to CGH by Raffles Medical Clinic in late 2011 for coughing, breathlessness and blood in her phlegm that a nodule was found in her chest.

> A biopsy in February 2012 confirmed that the nodule was malignant. The lung cancer progressed and spread to her brain by October 2016. Ms Azlin sued CGH and three doctors in January 2015, saying that their negligence had delayed the diagnosis and treatment of her lung cancer.

> The Court of Appeal found that the two Accident & Emergency doctors in the case were not in breach of duty, but said the first CGH doctor Ms Azlin had seen had breached his duty of care for failing to schedule a follow-up appointment.

> However, the judges found none of the doctors liable for negligence, finding instead that the hospital had caused a significant delay of at least seven months in diagnosis.

> CGH's system to review radiological reports was also found to be ""inadequate"" as it did not allow comprehensive management of patients. Each time Ms Azlin visited the A&E department was treated as an isolated incident and there was no sharing of notes among the doctors.

> CGH'S ARGUMENTS

> CGH argued that even if Ms Azlin had been treated earlier, there is no guarantee that she would be completely cured and expected to have a normal life expectancy as if she never had cancer.

> In response, Justice Ang said this submission is ""beside the point"".

> ""The statistical evidence showing that there is never any 100 per cent chance of a complete cure is only one factor in the entire mix of factors to consider if Ms Azlin would more likely than not have been 'cured' (that is, have no relapse within a specified timeframe) and live to her full life expectancy,"" she said.

> She found it ""clear"" that CGH's breach caused Ms Azlin to die in the way she did - by causing her cancer to progress from stage to stage such that her cancer cells entered her lymphatic system, increasing the risk of and causing a relapse of her cancer.

> This caused her eventual death, said Justice Ang.

> Both sides submitted various amounts for different kinds of damages. In particular, Ms Azlin's estate had sought about S$1 million in damages for Ms Azlin's pain, suffering and loss of amenity, while CGH asked for S$10,000, which the judge called ""surprising"".

> This was because the S$10,000 figure was ""so out of line with the precedents"" or previous cases, and also because CGH did not appeal against the decision to award S$200,000 in interim payment.

> ""On the other hand, the estate's position - S$1,051,000 - is also completely at odds with the precedents and is manifestly excessive,"" said Justice Ang.

> She ordered CGH to pay Ms Azlin's estate costs of S$105,000.

at least 200 patients were wrongly classified as having a more aggressive form of breast cancer than their actual condition due to a lab error at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH), Senior Minister of State for Health Koh Poh Koon said in Parliament on Monday (Jan 4). 

The authorities revealed last month that 180 patients were affected by the wrong diagnosis and half of them may have received unnecessary treatment.



The patients were wrongly classified as being positive for HER2 - a gene that controls how a healthy cell grows - instead of HER2 negative. This affects how a patient is treated, most commonly with a drug called Herceptin.

Common side effects due to HER2-directed treatment include diarrhoea, chills and fatigue. About 3 to 4 per cent of patients may also experience heart problems. 


Responding to parliamentary questions about the incident, Dr Koh said 200 patients have been reclassified from HER2 positive to HER2 negative as of Dec 23. ",t3_l0l7pm,19-01-2021

3239,17,erzv654,t3_c55hg1,"> # Grab driver’s act of greed at Changi Airport leaves family stranded without passports, valuables 

> SINGAPORE — After his passengers left a bag containing passports, cash and other valuables in his car when they alighted at Changi Airport, a 48-year-old Grab driver acted as if nothing had happened.

> Christopher Chan Fook Choy even lied to the ride-hailing firm about the bag — then kept the cash and phone, and dumped the passports and other identifying items in a rubbish chute.

> In doing so, Chan derailed the plans of a Malaysian family heading home to New Zealand, where they were living, on the morning of Jan 29 this year. They incurred hefty costs as they were unable to board their flight, and needed replacement passports.

> Chan, who pleaded guilty in the State Courts on Tuesday (June 25) to one charge of dishonest misappropriation of movable property, was sentenced to three weeks’ jail.

> He was also ordered to compensate his victims S$7,762 — representing the cost they suffered in replacing the passports and other documents. He was granted a request to pay in instalments as he could not afford to pay the full sum upfront.

> The misplaced black backpack contained six passports, three identification cards, two birth certificates, one marriage certificate, RM500 in cash, a stash of Australian and New Zealand currencies and a mobile phone. The items were worth some S$1,050 in all.

> They belonged to Ms Ngui How Ing, 46, who was in Singapore for a holiday with her family and travelling in the Grab car with her husband and two children.

> A frenzied Ms Ngui, who discovered to her horror that she did not have the bag five minutes after she alighted, called Grab before lodging a report with the police.

> Stranded without their passports, she and her family had to forfeit their air tickets, and rushed back to the place they had been staying, in Bukit Pasoh Road in Tanjong Pagar, to search for the bag.

> Meantime, Chan had found the bag but decided not to return it, and lied when contacted by Grab, by saying he did not find any backpack.

> The court heard that investigations revealed that Chan found the bag lying on the floor of his car’s rear passenger seat at about 8am – about 10 minutes after Ms Ngui realised her bag was missing.

> He took the money and phone from the bag, and threw all other vital identification documents in it down his flat’s central rubbish chute to avoid detection.

> State Prosecuting Officer Raj Kishore Rai said: “Out of greed, the accused dishonestly misappropriated all the cash in the backpack and proceeded to exchange the foreign currencies at a money changer at Jurong East Mall. He received S$850 in return.”

> Chan was however caught some four months later, at 11.40am on May 13.

> Court documents did not state how the police managed to track him down, only that he was found with a black backpack, a grey Vodafone Smart Ultra handphone belonging to the victim, and some loose coins amounting to $21.10 New Zealand dollars and $39.30 Australian dollars.

> A sum of S$850, which Chan had obtained after exchanging the foreign currencies with a moneychanger, was also seized. The rest of the contents in the backpack were not recovered.

> Chan’s actions in January had caused the Malaysian family much trouble.

> They had to fly back to Malaysia to apply for new documents to replace their lost passports, identification cards, birth certificates and marriage certificate.

> They also had to return to Singapore to get new copies of their residency visas to travel back to New Zealand. The process to replace the lost documents cost S$7,762, and Ms Ngui could leave Singapore for New Zealand only about three weeks later on Feb 20.

> Chan could have been jailed for up to two years, fined or received both a jail term and a fine.

As an extension - Singapore is terrible at acknowledging the importance of many jobs using money. We do all sorts of crap like ""MW appreciation day"", ""nurses appreciation day"", ""road sweepers appreciation day"", ""security guards appreciation day"", make posters and videos thanking them, bring them to Marina Barrage for picnics, write cards and shit to constantly remind them how our society simply cannot do without their services..

..but pay them fuck all.

I work in a school and I'm familiar with the numbers underlying our security and janitorial contracts and how much (little) actually ends up in the workers' pockets. In summary, it's a shame.

the 12 hours shift is due to a lack of manpower. and i highly believe it is only meant for the 3 days and not full 6 months contract — i could be wrong about this. retail jobs usually require OT during such manpower shortage such as CNY. i honestly do not think working 12 hours for 3D would significantly reduce immunity, because the work may not be physically demanding, and having sufficient sleep is still very possible.

3383,17,fahpxep,t3_e9757a,"People are all up in arms about how the enforcement officer shouldn't have kicked the offending rider, but no one is talking about whether the officers received adequate training and equipment for enforcing PMD offences.

It's easy to sit behind a keyboard and say that the officers should have just taken note of the PMD license plate, and reported to LTA. What then if the license plate was removed, or if the rider covered his face to hide his identity? Even if LTA was able to track down the owner of the PMD, it just becomes a he-said-she-said situation. That's not even accounting for the difficulty in getting a good look of the license plate of a vehicle moving at speed, while you're on foot.

On top of all of that, it did not appear the offender had any intention of stopping. Not obeying the lawful instructions of law enforcement is almost unheard of in Singapore. Allowing the offender to get away would have only enabled more brazen disregard for the rule of law. Do people really think that the outcome of evading law enforcement is going to be a bed of roses?

Kicking the offender was probably not the best thing to do in this situation, and neither is celebrating the rider getting hurt.

Riding on the road using a PMD is dangerous, but it is not an ARRESTABLE offence (as per the Criminal Procedure Code and Penal Code) .  This means that the Aetos Officer was NOT legally enabled to use force in the first place. 

So what should the officer have done?  He should have let the errant PMD rider go first, call for backup and used surrounding cameras to identify him in the future.

Remember Alyosius Pang? He ignored SOP and became the next section and an example why SOPs need to be followed.

If you read the battle of Jutland, the British Navy nearly lost the war because idiots ignored the SOP. See, during peace time training and competition, British battleships and cruisers crews cut corners to speed up reload and increase rate of fire for competitions and for officers to get medals and promotions. Those medals and ranks meant jackshit when the ships were blown to kingdom come. They did this by leaving hatches to gunpowder magazine open to speed up reload. So in a ""real"" battle, one hit, and sparks and flame travelled down the magazine and blew the ships up. Ships after ships blew up and the Admiralty didn't know why. One of the newer ships, which had newer, less experienced crews, did not. Turned out the crew was new, so they did ""by the book"". Their accuracy was horrible, about half of others, but they stayed in the fight while the peace time ""better"" crews paid the ultimate price.

SOPs were written for a very good reason. Follow it, or the price can be in blood. If your supervisor is pressuring you to ignore it, often, it's not his blood that will be the price. It's yours or it will ultimately be you as the most proximate cause. Consider that before contravening them.

I would caution the use of the term ""kick"" here. From the video, he made no swing motion to gather enough potential energy to justify it's use. To the untrained eye it may look like a Roundhouse kick but it ain't.

>however the law enforcement officer is at fault for taking matters into his own hands

Would you make the same case for any security/enforcement personnel discharging their duty?

I mean, if he isn't responsible for doing what is quite LITERALLY his job on scene, then pray tell who is?

>endangering the lives of the rider, himself and any bystanders

The errant rider was already doing this WITHOUT the on scene officer. Wtf you talking about fam? You need another case of an old lady dying to an errant rider for convincing? A precedent was already established.

>He should have did the proper procedure of taking down the license plate

Or... to get multiple Kinects looking at the same area, and build games/apps to take multiple Kinects into account. You could easily do this in v1. NOT IN V2 because Microsoft's infinite wisdom tied 1 Kinect to 1 PC only, and forced you to client server program for multiple Kinects.

> SINGAPORE: A bus driver who takes people from Changi Airport to dedicated facilities for their stay-home notice has tested positive for COVID-19, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Monday (Feb 8).

> The 49-year-old Singaporean is employed by Cobb and Coach Services and his job includes transporting people from the airport to dedicated facilities for their isolation period.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He is among the two community COVID-19 cases reported in Singapore on Monday.

> He developed a runny nose on Jan 31 but did not seek medical attention, MOH said. The infection was detected after he was tested on Feb 5 as part of rostered routine testing, and his pooled test result came back positive on Feb 6.

> An individual test was done that night at Tan Tock Seng hospital, and came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day.

> He was taken by ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> His earlier tests from rostered routine testing – the last being on Jan 23 – were negative for COVID-19. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection, said MOH.

> ENGINEER WHO GOT VACCINE TESTS POSITIVE

> The other community case reported on Monday was a 30-year-old Indian national who is a work pass holder and works as an engineer at Station Satcom. As part of his job, he boards ships to install communications and IT equipment, said MOH.

> He was earlier identified as a close contact of a previous case - a sea crew member who arrived from Japan aboard a vessel and confirmed to have COVID-19 on Jan 11 - and placed in quarantine from Jan 13 to Jan 24.

> Advertisement

> His swabs taken during quarantine on Jan 13 and Jan 21 were negative for COVID-19, said MOH. Subsequent tests taken as part of rostered routine testing - the last on Jan 29 - were also negative for the coronavirus.

> He received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Jan 27.

> On Feb 4, he developed fatigue and had a fever the next day, but did not seek medical attention, said the health ministry.

> He was tested for COVID-19 on Feb 5 as part of rostered routine testing, and his result came back positive the next day. He was also taken to NCID.

> ""While his serological test taken on Feb 7 has come back positive, this is assessed to be a recent infection as he is symptomatic, and the Ct value for his polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was low,"" said MOH.

> The health ministry said the vaccine that the man took on Jan 27 accounts for his positive serology test as he has likely started producing antibodies following the jab.

> ""As the vaccine does not contain live virus, he could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination,"" said the health ministry.

> Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. All identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period

> ""We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them,"" said MOH.

> Singapore reported 22 COVID-19 cases in total on Monday, bringing the national tally to 59,721 cases.

Yeah, that's not what he said. He said (paraphrased):

""Rise in imported cases not due to **more** travellers entering S’pore""

>“We have not increased (the number of) travellers coming into Singapore,” Mr Wong said on Monday.

>""Why have the numbers gone up? It’s simply because the prevalence rate, the incidence rate, of the disease is much higher now. The virus is raging in countries everywhere.”Mr Wong said that the largest sources of travellers remain construction and foreign domestic workers, and the number of these workers entering >Singapore has also not risen “in recent times”. These travellers are required to take a pre-departure test 72 hours before they arrive.“ But the nature of these sorts of tests is that they are not foolproof,” Mr Wong said, adding that some people may initially test negative while the body is incubating the virus.

> SINGAPORE: Three inmates at Changi Prison and a staff nurse working there have tested positive for COVID-19 as of Friday (May 29).

> 

> All four cases are unlinked, said the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) in a statement on Saturday, in response to queries from the media.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""All three inmates were newly admitted inmates who were still undergoing cohort segregation when they tested positive for the virus following a swab test,"" said SPS.

> SPS said that as part of COVID-19 precautionary measures, all newly admitted inmates are kept apart from the general inmate population for 14 days.

> Following confirmation of their positive results, the three inmates in question were then isolated and put in a separate prison facility, away from the rest of the newly admitted inmates.

> Two of the inmates have been discharged from that facility and the third remains ""clinically well"", said SPS.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The prison service added that the staff nurse, from its medical service provider, has recovered and is back at work.

> 

> SPS did not indicate when all four cases were detected.

> PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES POST CIRCUIT BREAKER

> 

> Under the ""circuit breaker"" put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19, SPS had earlier suspended all family visits and face-to-face programmes for inmates.

> 

> When the circuit breaker is lifted on Jun 1, SPS said the same precautionary measures will remain in place and brought back in a ""gradual and phased"" manner.

> 

> This will apply to certain core rehabilitation programmes like academic classes, which may gradually resume with safe distancing measures in place.

> SINGAPORE: A toddler who died after being crushed by a mirror at a shop in Jewel Changi Airport was standing in front of it when her brother and a family friend squeezed out from behind the mirror, causing it to fall.

> This was revealed on the first day of the coroner's inquiry into the death of Chinese national Lai Jiaxin, who was a year old at the time of the incident on Aug 23, 2019.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The court heard that she had come to Singapore with her six-year-old brother, her mother Mrs Lai, her grandmother and some family friends for a holiday earlier that week on Aug 19.

> On Aug 23, Mrs Lai checked in for their flight back home to Fujian, China.

> While waiting for the flight, they went shopping and headed to the Urban Revivo boutique in Jewel Changi Airport.

> Footage shown in court showed the two families entering the shop. The group comprised Mrs Lai and her mother, Jiaxin and her six-year-old brother, Mrs Lai's friend, her friend's mother, and her friend's six-year-old son and one-year-old daughter.

> 

> Mrs Lai went into the dressing room to try on clothes with her friend, while both their mothers stayed outside and cared for their respective grandchildren.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Footage showed the children tottering about the shop, with the grandmothers trying to catch up with them.

> Jiaxin's brother and the family friend's son squeezed in a space between a 1.99m-tall mirror and the wall.

> Jiaxin was shown standing in front of the mirror. The boys then squeezed out of the space behind the mirror, with Jiaxin's brother getting out first.

> As the second boy stepped out, the mirror toppled forward and onto the girl. Immediately, the family members and staff stepped forward to help, with three people lifting the 116.5kg mirror.

> The 0.83m-tall girl was bleeding profusely from her nose and mouth. She was taken to hospital but pronounced dead later that day after about an hour of resuscitation efforts.

> CAUSE OF DEATH: HEAD INJURY

> An autopsy found that the cause of death was a head injury. Jiaxin was found to have suffered injuries to her head, skull, brain, neck, upper and lower limbs, with her airway and lungs affected from the impact.

> The court heard that none of the staff had approached the grandmothers on the behaviour of the children, and that no one had previously tried to squeeze into the space behind the mirror as it was ""very small"" and not meant for a normal-sized person.

> Urban Revivo said it had never had issues with the mirrors. There were about six to seven such mirrors in the store, but all were removed after the incident.

> The standing mirror had been designed by a team based in Guangzhou, China, specifically for the store in Singapore. No other store carries such a design.

> They were designed to allow greater flexibility for the mirrors to be moved around the store, due to the changing fashion designs.

> The mirror's design had gone through various rounds of vetting and was approved by the head of design in Guangzhou, the court heard.

> Safety was one of the aspects considered by the team and there were no issues reported after the store's opening in Singapore.

> The mirrors were installed according to Singapore's Building and Construction Authority's regulations, and the guidelines were very stringent as Jewel Changi Airport was a landmark, the court heard.

> STEPS TAKEN AFTER INCIDENT

> After the incident, Urban Revivo conducted training for staff to watch out for unattended or rowdy children and to remind parents to be more cautious.

> Urban Revivo also put up signs reminding parents not to leave their children unattended and installed new mirrors that are screwed down.

> A mandatory safety checklist was implemented in all Singapore stores, to be completed daily, and the general manager has to perform periodic safety checks on stores.

> ""Testimonies from the next-of-kin and CCTV footage strongly suggest that the incident happened due to a child's unattended actions,"" said the investigating officer, who read out the report into the case.

> ""As the children were of a young age, they could not have understood the consequences of their actions,"" she said.

> The police are of the view that Jiaxin's demise ""was a misadventure"" and do not suspect any foul play.

> Jiaxin's family did not attend court on Thursday as they are in China.

> State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam said she would deliver written findings on Apr 15.

She was one. This hurts to read. It's really sad.

There was no malice. There was no real fault of any design. It was just an unfortunate accident because the kids were playing where they shouldn't. It was a mistake, yes. But it would have been a normal childish one in any other time. It's simply a very unfortunate accident.

It's really sad to read this, but I also feel especially so for the brother and his friend. They will have to live the rest of their lives knowing that their moment of having fun resulted in the death of his sister; someone that he, as the older brother, likely felt he was supposed to protect.

I am not sure what this mirror is made of. A mirror made of very thick glass is undesirable as light refraction will make for undesirable viewing artifacts. For a glass panel of 2000mm x 800mm to approach 100kg, It'd have to be about 25mm thick. Even at half the thickness, with the other half allocated to frame and weighted base, there'be undesirable distortion.

It could of course be relatively thin - maybe 4mm glass with a metal backing plate and extra heavy weighted base. It'd still be a little heavy, and I don't see the mirror toppling because of a nudge if 70% of its mass is in the base.

> SINGAPORE — A former Changi Airport baggage handler who swapped the tags of nearly 300 baggage in protest at his work conditions was sentenced to 20 days' jail on Monday (11 November).

> Singaporean Tay Boon Keh caused 286 pieces of luggages to be sent to the wrong destination, affecting 221 passengers.

> The 65-year-old had felt ill-treated by his company as no additional manpower was deployed to assist him.

> On Monday, District Judge Jasvender Kaur noted that Tay was suffering from moderate to severe Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), which was left untreated during the offences, which were committed from November 2016 to February 2017.

> “The issue is whether the thought process to swap the baggage tags was a product of his MDD which impaired his decision making capacity and self-control, or was it the product of his sense of injustice at being treated unfairly at work and desire to get back at his employer,” said the judge.

> After Tay pleaded guilty to 20 counts of mischief on 26 October last year, his sentencing was adjourned for an ancillary hearing held in March and May this year to determine whether his psychiatric condition had caused or contributed to his offending actions.

> DJ Kaur found that Tay’s actions were a result of his sense of injustice and not due to his psychiatric condition.

> She accepted an Institute of Mental Health (IMH) psychiatrist’s assessment that Tay’s “strong feeling of injustice caused him to feel upset” and when Tay swapped the baggage tags, he “felt he was getting back at the company and this decreased his sense of injustice thus resulting in him feeling relieved”.

> “I find that the accused’s ability to consider the options and his strong feeling of injustice shows that this action in swapping the baggage tags was to avenge the perceived injustice and not due to the MDD,” said the judge.

> She also found that the major depressive disorder had also not significantly contributed to his offending.

> In sentencing Tay, DJ Kaur described the offences as “not trivial” as Tay had abused his position and had caused “significant monetary and reputational losses” to airlines SilkAir and Singapore Airlines, and Changi Airport. The airlines had to compensate victims more than $40,000.

> Tay was employed by Lian Cheng Contracting, a sub-contractor of Changi Airport Group that handles baggage operations at Terminal 2. Lian Cheng would provide manpower to perform X-ray screenings for luggage.

> Tay began work on 7 September 2016 and was deployed to an X-ray machine to align checked-in luggage and ensure they were properly placed in the machine for security screening before being sent to their planes.

> However, the X-ray machine Tay was deployed at had frequent breakdowns and Tay had to carry luggage to another X-ray machine about 6m away. He complained about the issue to his supervisor but received no assistance.

> Tay thus felt aggrieved and ill-treated by the company. Out of frustration and anger at Lian Cheng, he decided to swap the paper baggage tags attached to the luggage.

> He peeled off the ends of tags and placed them on other bags in an area that was out of view of CCTVs. The bags would then be sent to the wrong flights. Among the mix-ups, luggage that had been intended for New Zealand ended up in the Maldives, while some intended for Turkey ended up in Australia.

> Tay stopped the acts in February 2017 after realising that his actions had not resulted in additional manpower to his deployed area.

> By then, 286 pieces of luggage had been affected.

> Due to the incident, Singapore Airlines and SilkAir had to compensate 221 affected passengers with $42,346.59 as of 1 October last year.

> Defence counsels Lok Vi Ming and Tang Jin Sheng had previously argued that there was a causal link between the acts and Tay’s MDD, which had deprived him of self-control, and Tay derived temporary relief from switching the baggage tags.

> “The fact that his MDD affected his self-control is evidenced by the fact that he would go to the toilet during breaks and cry in the cubicle,” said the defence lawyers, who asked for an order of conditional discharge or a fine of $10,000.

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiam Jia Min sought a jail term of 20 days for Tay who caused “severe harm” in his actions due to the “large scale of mischief” caused and the losses suffered by the airlines and Changi Airport in terms of reputation and money.

> DPP Thiam pointed out that Tay’s actions could have had severe or even fatal consequences for passengers if they were unable to assess medication that was in the lost baggage.

> For mischief, Tay could have been jailed up to a year and/or fined on each count.

> The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed 25 new cases of Covid-19 in Singapore on Friday (Feb. 5).

> This brings the total number of cases to 59,649.

> Community case works at Changi Cargo Megaplex 1

> There are two new locally-transmitted cases of Covid-19 infection. One is in the community, while another resides in a dormitory.

> The community case is Case 59,980, a 56-year-old male Singaporean who works as an import officer at Yusen Logistics and is based at Changi Cargo Megaplex 1 (119 Airport Cargo Road).

> According to MOH, his job does not entail interaction with flight passengers.

> The man developed a cough on Feb. 2, but did not seek medical attention and continued to go to work.

> As he had been identified earlier as a contact of a tuberculosis (TB) case at his workplace, he went to the Tuberculosis Control Unit on Feb. 4 for TB screening, where he was tested for Covid-19 after he reported his symptoms.

> His test result came back positive for Covid-19 infection on the same day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).

> MOH said that the man's earlier test from a testing operation of airport cargo workers on Jan. 18 had been negative, so this is likely a current infection.

> The dormitory case is Case 59,966, a 31-year-old male Bangladeshi national.

> He is a Work Pass holder who arrived in Singapore on Dec. 13, 2020, and served Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at a dedicated facility until Dec. 27, 2020.

> According to MOH, he has not started working since arriving in Singapore, and stays at a dormitory located at 1 Soon Lee Street.

> 23 imported cases

> The other 23 cases announced today are imported. They had been placed on Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving SHN.

> Here is a breakdown of the imported cases:

> 25 cases discharged

> 25 more cases of Covid-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.

> In all, 59,373 have fully recovered from Covid-19 infection, and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.

> There are currently about 41 confirmed cases who are still in the hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, with one case in the intensive care unit.

> 206 cases who have mild symptoms or who are clinically well but still test positive for Covid-19 are isolated, and are cared for at community facilities.

> 29 have passed away from complications due to Covid-19 infection.

> New locations

> MOH regularly updates a list of public places visited by confirmed Covid-19 cases for more than 30 minutes when they were infectious.

> There are five new locations:

> Northpoint City (930 Yishun Avenue 2) Jan. 23, 1pm to 4:05pm Jan. 27, 6:10pm to 7pm Jan. 29, 7pm to 7:30pm

> Sun Plaza (30 Sembawang Drive): Jan. 23, 6pm to 7:15pm Jan. 24, 2.50pm to 3.30pm

> White Sands (1 Pasir Ris Central Street 3) Jan. 31, 6:20pm to 8:35pm

> ValuDollar at White Sands (1 Pasir Ris Central Street 3) Jan. 31, 6:30pm to 7pm

> Jurong Point (1 Jurong West Central 2) 4pm to 5pm

> 

> You can see the full list of locations here:

> Those who had been identified as close contacts of confirmed cases would already have been notified by MOH.

> As a precautionary measure, persons who had been at these locations during the specified timings should monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit.

> They should see a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose), as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history.

N.A are retiree/homemaker which are not bound by office hours. Thus considering the pool, we have a good mix on people who are bound by office hours that u/thankiw listed in the comment below and people who aren't bound by office hours. 

My point is, I do agree blue collars who are bound by working hours are more likely to be deterred to seek treatment, but there are actually tweaking to the system that cut down the number of MCs they are issued. I don't see why they are not being responsible. 

Based on the cases, it's a good mixed, thus it's more of a mentality that even though you are not bound by office hours, people tend not to see a doctor when they develop systems for the fear of being penalized for it. Yes, I do see the point that some companies do not see the benefit of keeping people from spreading disease outweigh the benefit of having a sick person doing the job, but rather that waiting for them to change the policy or practice, which essentially they never will, be responsible and do what is needed for the sake of community.

One thing to note, there are many cases I didn't list out that are blue collars (bound by working hours) and actively seek treatment when they developed symptoms on the same day. I don't see why these people who are bound by the same condition but can do what is responsible.

You are purposely dense, aren't you?

A 14days MC means this workers can only be sick for 3 times in the whole year as each sickness and visitation to doctor will reduce their MC entitlement by 5 days.

Illness such as flu and cough are so common due to Singapore weather. It probably happens more than 10 times a year for an average person. So what happen next? Take unpaid leave is it? You help them pay their bills is it? 

A blue collar worker does not enjoy privilege of working home. They want to work at home while they are sick also cannot. 

A blue collar worker is less likely to enjoy income stability. Some are paid by hours, days, or weeks. If they don't turn up for work, they don't get paid. How? You help like pay their bills is it? 

A blue collar worker is less likely to be in the position of power. Coupled with Singapore's asymal employee rights, the companies can anyhow hatam them because they took '' too much'' MC. You want to hire them?",t3_ldah3b,06-02-2021

4002,17,gm7e80t,t1_gm79doc,"MOH encourage employers to allow usage of 44 extra HL for cases like these. My company is practising that for one. My friends in other companies also reported the same thing.

FYI, now clinics don’t give 5 days MC except for young kids and senior for who is not suitable for swab test. They give 3 days max. Mostly by 2nd day morning you have your result of the swab test. So maximum MC you consume each time is 2 days which means you can see doctor for the same symptoms for 7 times, and that is exclusive of 44 days you have for HL. We have quite a number of people for government affiliated, I.e the K-9 unit, screening officer in Changi Airport, don’t tell me that these org are not practicing to utilise the 44 days HL if theirs exceed.

Edit: where do you get your data an average person get seasonal flu symptoms 10 times a year?

Did a search - flu season tends to be from May to July, and Dec to Feb, even if you take a month each to get it with everyone masked on, that would 6 times.

SINGAPORE - Changi Airport will suspend operations at Terminal 4 from May 16, following a [suspension of services at Terminal 2](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/coronavirus-changi-airport-t2-proceeds-with-plans-to-suspend-operations-from-may) earlier this month.

In a statement on Tuesday (May 12), Changi Airport Group said:  ""Changi Airport's terminal operations will be consolidated further to  optimise resources in tandem with the sharp decline in flight movements  because of the global Covid-19 pandemic.

""This move will enable CAG and its airport partners to continue to save on running costs such as utilities and cleanin

Airlines currently based in T4 will operate out of Terminals 1 or 3  instead. Cathay Pacific and Korean Air will move to T1. The assigned  terminal for other airlines will be announced when they next operate  flights at Changi.

As a result, the stores and restaurants in T4 will close and the  shuttle bus service connecting to T3 will be suspended until operations  in T4 resume.

""The timing of this will depend on when air travel demand picks up  and on the requirements of airlines seeking to relaunch flights at  Changi Airport,"" CAG added.

""Even as terminal operations are scaled down during this period, CAG  continues to work closely with its airline and airport partners, and  stands ready to restart operations at T4 as soon as a sufficient number  of flights return to the terminal.""

Last month, Changi Airport handled 25,200 passenger movements  and 3,870 aircraft movements. Airfreight throughput for the month stood  at 96,500 tonnes.

In a Facebook post on T4's closure, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan  said: ""These are trying times for aviation and the Changi community.  Great uncertainties remain but we remain optimistic on eventual aviation  recovery.

[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/coronavirus-changi-airport-terminal-4-to-suspend-operations-from-may-16](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/coronavirus-changi-airport-terminal-4-to-suspend-operations-from-may-16)""Meanwhile, Changi continues to play its part, bringing essential  supplies to Singapore and mounting repatriation flights. And finalising  detailed plans to protect crew and air passengers, when people start to  fly again.""

Senior Minister of State for Transport Lam Pin Min said Singapore’s  air hub still stands on strong foundations in spite of the difficult  times, noting that the airport has just been named the world’s best  airport for the eighth consecutive year. 

Terminal 4 is the newest terminal at the airport, having opened in October 2017.

It was conceptualised in 2011 to boost Changi Airport's terminal  capacity ahead of the completion of the Changi East project, which is  expected to be completed only in the 2030s.

The move to suspend operations will also lead to some other changes at the airport. 

CAG said on Tuesday that skytrain services in the airport have been reduced due to low demand. 

Visitors and staff can continue to use the MRT link bridge between T3  and T2, and the link bridges leading to Jewel Changi Airport. 

Taxi stands at T1 and T3 will be consolidated, with one serving each terminal. 

On the airside, several finger piers in T1 and T3, where planes park around, will not be used for flights until demand returns.",t3_gi5ekt,12-05-2020

Jewel Changi Airport may often be crowded but this has not translated into strong sales for all tenants.

Nine months after the opening of the 10-storey development, which boasts more than 280 shops and food and beverage outlets, some retailers say business has been slow.

When The Straits Times visited Jewel recently, sales staff at eight out of 17 shops surveyed said meeting sales targets has been challenging. Stores that offer unique concepts or are exclusively located at Jewel seem to be doing better than retail chains that have multiple outlets in more accessible areas of Singapore.

A retail manager at a basement-level fashion store, who declined to be named, said the store has not been meeting its sales target for the last three months.

She said: ""Though business picked up in December because of the school holidays, sales are still not that great. Many people come here to eat and look at the waterfall rather than actually shop.""

The brand that she works for has an outlet in the Orchard Road shopping belt also which, she says, performs about three times better than the store at Jewel. A check with several other retail chains, which also have outlets in the Orchard stretch, revealed that those stores also performed at least 50 per cent better than their branches in Jewel.

A sales employee of a fashion store located below the prime ground floor said foot traffic is typically lower at the basement levels with more customers opting to explore the retail stores at levels one and two.

The employee, who declined to be named, said: ""This place is quite large and many people want to take time to explore the attractions when they are here. So they end up shopping for only a short time, which means they can't visit every store.""

Part-time sales employee Eryanty Zainalabiden, 33, who works at popular salted egg snack store Irvins, said about 80 per cent of the store's customers are tourists from countries such as China, Indonesia and Thailand.

She said: ""So when these countries are not having school holidays, then we get fewer customers.""

Though she shared that sales targets were met in December due to the Christmas crowd, the store experienced a 30 per cent drop in sales in October and November, compared with the previous months, when it saw fewer tourists.

Local ready-to-wear brand In Good Company, though, has seen bustling crowds at its level one store at Jewel.

In Good Company's managing director of sales Jaclyn Teo said: ""We've seen increased foot traffic over the last few months and we're optimistic about 2020. We are also happy that our store's food and beverage partner, Birds of Paradise, has seen snaking queues and an increasing fan following, both local and overseas, at its gelato boutique.""
The clothing store at Jewel also sees about double the amount of tourist spending compared with each of the brand's two stores in Orchard Road.

Restaurants on Jewel's level five also reported brisk business.

Restaurant staff that The Straits Times spoke to last month said business has been strong for the past few months, especially since opening hours were changed.

The shorter hours have allowed for better staff welfare and manpower management.
In July, all eight restaurants at Jewel Changi Airport's fifth floor Canopy Park, including Burger & Lobster and Prive, had their operating hours shortened.

The best you can do is to reverse the underlying problem (treat sepsis aggressively with antibiotics), maintain adequate hydration and cut down/ stop the use of vasopressors as soon as you can. Sometimes despite best efforts peripheral gangrene sets in. These medications are only used when absolutely necessary to maintain life support. One can choose not to use them but must accept the consequence of death. 

Of course if you use them indiscriminately or negligently you can cause gangrene too but most cases are not due to that.

> His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection, said MOH.

> Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all of the man's identified close contacts, including his family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine.

> They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period to detect asymptomatic cases. Serological tests will also be conducted for the close contacts to determine if the man could have been infected by them.

> Singapore introduced electronic monitoring devices in August last year for all incoming travellers serving their stay-home notice outside of dedicated facilities. Those aged 12 and below are exempted from this requirement.

> Advertisement

> These individuals are issued with the device at the checkpoints, after immigration clearance.

> They are required to activate the electronic monitoring device upon reaching their place of residence. If the device is not activated as required, the authorities will follow up to determine their location, and assist to resolve any technical difficulties, or take enforcement action, as the case may be.

> IMPORTED CASES

> The remaining 23 cases were imported and had been placed on stay-home notice upon arrival. Of those 21 were asymptomatic, and three were symptomatic.

> The imported cases include two Singaporeans and one permanent resident who returned from Canada, Ethiopia, India and the United Arab Emirates.

> Six of them are dependant's pass holders who arrived from India, Spain, the UAE and the United States.

> There are five work pass holders who arrived from Spain and the UAE.

> Eight of the cases are work permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines​​​​​​​. Three of them are foreign domestic workers.

> The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at two cases per week in the past two weeks.

> ""We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme,"" said MOH.

> Among the 163 confirmed cases reported from Feb 1 to Feb 7, 82 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 30 have tested negative and 51 test results are pending.

> As of Sunday, Singapore has reported a total of 59,699 COVID-19 cases, with 29 fatalities.

>

> 

> MOH said on Saturday that a resident staying at a migrant worker dormitory is Singapore’s first likely case of COVID-19 re-infection.

> The case is a 28-year-old Bangladeshi work permit holder who stays in a dormitory at 43 Tech Park Crescent.

> He was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Apr 12 last year. He tested positive again on Jan 25 this year.

> ""He was identified from rostered monitoring testing conducted as part of MOH’s surveillance of recovered workers to monitor their postinfection immunity,"" said the ministry.

4246,17,dxzmy3e,t3_8f0myy,"SINGAPORE - Two otters believed to be from the Pasir Ris family were found dead near the Changi Sailing Club.

While one was found trapped in an illegal fishing cage, the other was seen on the beach near the cage.

A member of the public who found the otters on Wednesday alerted Facebook page OtterWatch on Thursday (April 26) morning.

Photos shared by OtterWatch show one of the otters covered in mud in a large metal cage under a boardwalk, while the other had been washed up on the beach.

Avid otter watcher Jeffrey Teo, who is part of OtterWatch, told The Straits Times that the otter found in the cage was ""in a bad shape"".

It had metal cuts on its face and a monitor lizard was seen chewing on its body, he said, adding that the carcass will be handed over to the Wildlife Reserves Singapore for a post-mortem.

However, the carcass of the other otter which was found on the beach near the cage, was no longer there by the time volunteers went down.

National University of Singapore (NUS) biology lecturer N. Sivasothi, who heads the Otter Working Group, told ST that the otters were likely from the Pasir Ris family, comprising 10 adults and four pups.

The family usually roam the waters in Pasir Ris and Changi, and in November last year, made a surprising appearance on the tarmac of Changi Airport.

Mr Sivasothi said that the otters, just like other wild animals, could have been in search of food, when they became trapped.

""Any wild animal will explore their surroundings in great detail in pursuit of food,"" he said.

""While otters usually suspicious of new structures and are careful around them, there could be a possibility that the cage has been there for quite a while, and they have become familiar enough with it to explore it.""

He added that if fish was used as bait in the cage, then this may have driven the otters to enter it and tragically get caught, before drowning.

With Singapore's waterways now relatively clear of pollution, wildlife has started to make a return in recent years, he noted.

Hence, there is a greater urgency to eradicate illegal fishing practices that could have a significant detrimental effect on wild animals, he said.

Currently, the public is able to alert national water agency PUB on suspicious activities in Singapore's reservoirs.

But in other areas, it is often the public who remove illegal traps, cages or fishing lines on their own initiative.

In June last year, a dead otter from the Bishan family was found in a cage along Marina Promenade in the Kallang Basin. A man was caught setting up traps in the area later that day.

And in January, otters were spotted climbing an illegal fish-trapping cage in the Marina Reservoir. An otter watcher alerted PUB, which removed the cage with with the help of otter community group OtterWatch.

It is illegal to use such trapping cages in any reservoirs or waterways, even in areas where fishing is allowed.

Additionally, those caught trapping any animal or doing any act which injures fauna in any reservoir may be fined up to $3,000.",t3_8f0myy,26-04-2018

> SINGAPORE: When COVID-19 disrupted his flight plans to return home to Kazakhstan from Bali with his fiancee, a man drank alcohol and later assaulted four police officers at Changi Airport while in transit in Singapore.

> Kazakhstani Shevtsov Maxim, 26, was sentenced to four months' jail on Friday (May 8) for his attacks on the officers at Terminal 2 on Mar 21.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt to a police officer and another of using criminal force on the same man.

> Another four charges including punching and kicking three other police officers were taken into consideration.

> Maxim's lawyer Chenthil Kumarasingam told the court that his client had been in Bali with his fiancee when the COVID-19 outbreak resulted in changes to their flights home.

> He was told at the last minute that he had to travel alone and transit through Singapore, apart from his fiancee who was the one between them who spoke English.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Stressed, he drank whiskey at Bali's Denpasar airport, said Mr Kumarasingam.

> While at the departure transit area in Singapore's Changi Airport at Terminal 2, Maxim started making a scene, court documents said.

> He was behaving rowdily towards the cashier from TungLok Teahouse and two officers were speaking to him when Staff Sergeant Mohd Irwan Haron, from the Airport Police Division, approached Maxim.

> He told Maxim to calm down and take a seat, but Maxim ignored him and continued trying to order two bottles of beer from the cashier.

> SSGT Mohd Irwan placed his hand on Maxim's shoulder to direct him to sit down, but Maxim turned suddenly and punched him in the face.

> He continued to act aggressively and scuffled with the officer. The other officers stepped in to arrest him, but Maxim continued to struggle violently.

> He kicked SSGT Mohd Irwan in the face near his eyebrow and punched a second officer in the cheek.

> As Maxim ""was of large size and had continued to behave violently"", the officers used necessary force to subdue and arrest him.

> HANDCUFFED, BUT CONTINUED TO BEHAVE AGGRESSIVELY

> He was placed in a wheelchair and handcuffed before being escorted towards Changi General Hospital for a check-up before going to lock-up.

> On the way to the hospital, he spat on SSGT Mohd Irwan's face and kicked two other officers.

> SSGT Mohd Irwan later sought medical attention and was found with abrasions over his eyelid and both forearms.

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Benedict Teong asked for at least five months' jail, noting that there were multiple victims and that SSGT Mohd Irwan had been attacked in an exceptionally vulnerable part of his body.

> Maxim's lawyer asked instead for two months' jail, saying there were ""unusual circumstances that caused him some stress"".

> He said his client did not remember the offences but takes responsibility for them and has not been difficult in any way since he sobered up.

> The prosecutor agreed with the judge that ""it cannot be that because he's a foreigner, he gets a lighter sentence"" as per what the defence asked for.

> For voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, Maxim could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments.

4398,17,dwyj1bg,t1_dwyiby2,"Well instant is kind of a misnomer; technically even when your heart stops beating your brain will operate for a number of seconds etc.

Bullet damage doesn’t just come from direct perforation as well; there’s a wound channel where the bullet dumps it’s energy into the body. There’s two parts of this; the permanent channel where the bullet blows out the flesh and it more or less doesn’t fill back in, and the temporary cavity, where it does. I’d suspect that having the heart within the permanent wound channel would be sufficient to damage it enough to make it more or less immediately inoperable, but I’m not sure.

Additionally the nerves that control the heart are in the sympathetic nerves, which pass through the spine, so severing or damaging the spine should also be able to stop the heart I believe. Again it could be that it just needs to be within the permanent cavitation of the wound channel too.

Not a medical doctor knowledgeable about gun wounds or anything but from what I understand it doesn’t necessarily need to be a direct perforation.

Also, bullets do sometimes break up on impact and send multiple pieces throughout the body increasing chance in a perforation, in the case that’s its needed. Though I don’t think .303 is particularly noted for breaking up.

At any rate if you take multiple .303 to center mass at the same time you’re probably dead real fast.",t3_8aeooz,07-04-2018

> According to a media release on Tuesday (May 12), this will commence May 16 onwards, for an unspecified period.

> This, the airport group says, is in light of the small number of flights still operating in the terminal.

> Airlines currently based in T4 will operate out of Terminals 1 or 3 instead.

> With this, stores and restaurants in T4 will close and the shuttle bus service connecting to T3 will be suspended until operations in T4 resume.

> The group also said the timing of T4's reopening will depend on when air travel demand picks up, as well as on the requirements of airlines seeking to relaunch flights at Changi Airport.

> This move will enable the group and its airport partners to continue to save on running costs such as utilities and cleaning.

> SINGAPORE — Changi Airport Group (CAG) has awarded its duty-free liquor and tobacco concession to Lotte Duty Free, which will start operations in June next year. 

> Lotte will be taking over from the DFS Group, which announced in August that it will not retain its duty-free liquor and tobacco concession at Changi Airport when its lease expires. 

> In a press statement on Thursday (Oct 24), CAG said the proposal from Lotte “stood out with its strong omni-channel and marketing ideas which will propel CAG’s travel retail strategy forward”.

> The contract awarded to Lotte — part of South Korean retail conglomerate Lotte Group — is for a six-year term commencing on June 9, 2020. The tenancy contract covers all 18 liquor and tobacco stores across Changi’s four terminals, spanning more than 8,000 sqm of retail space, CAG said. 

> Gebr Heinemann and The Shilla Duty Free were among those that reportedly submitted bids for the tender, which closed on Aug 26.

> CAG executive vice president (commercial) Lim Peck Hoon said the liquor and tobacco concession is ""one of the largest at Changi Airport and it presents unique opportunities for marketing innovation and customer engagement"".

> ""We were deeply impressed with the high quality of the tender proposals received and it was not an easy decision to make. We thank all the parties for their participation,"" said Ms Lim.

> ""Lotte put forth the strongest and most compelling proposal overall. It is aligned with CAG’s vision to offer passengers a seamless omni-channel retail experience and new retail-tainment initiatives leveraging smart technologies.""

> DFS chairman and chief executive officer Ed Brennan had said that the company took the decision not to bid ""based on our unique understanding of the business environment as the current operator of this concession at Changi"". “Specifically, changing regulations concerning the sale of liquor and tobacco, against a global context of geopolitical uncertainty, meant that staying in Changi was not a financially viable option,"" he said. 

> It was announced in this year’s national Budget speech that duty-free alcohol allowance would be reduced to 2 litres from the current 3 litres. And from July 2020, all tobacco products in Singapore will be required to be sold in plain packaging with graphic health warnings covering at least 75 per cent of the packet. 

> In Thursday's press release, Ms Lim said that Lotte had ""demonstrated a keen understanding of the market environment with a sound business plan supported by a competitive financial bid and backed up by solid business fundamentals"". 

> CAG noted that Lotte is the world’s second largest travel retailer in terms of sales turnover, and possesses extensive experience in the travel retail industry, including in the liquor and tobacco segment. 

> “With concession experience in markets like Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam, it has a proven track record of operating at a scale similar to that at Changi Airport and possesses deep consumer understanding,” CAG said. 

> When Lotte takes over operations, Changi Airport’s 18 liquor and tobacco stores will be rejuvenated with fresh designs to appeal to millennial consumers and other new consumer segments, CAG said.  

> It added that all stores will be “infused with lifestyle elements” and experiential activities such as customised whiskey-blending. There will also be specially curated zones featuring “the latest and trendiest products in the market”. 

> “All these, together with a host of annual large-scale consumer events, will raise the shopping experience at Changi Airport to new levels,” CAG added.

> Before its pull-out, DFS had been operating at Changi Airport since it opened in 1981. The award of the tender to Lotte ""marks the start of an exciting new chapter in Changi Airport’s retail history, as it would be the first time a new operator would be taking the helm of this key concession"", CAG said.

> Following DFS’ announcement that it is pulling out from Changi Airport, the operator reportedly retrenched 60 staff members earlier this month from its T Galleria shop on Scotts Road and at Changi Airport, as well as its shared services centre in Chai Chee. The layoffs triggered some unhappiness among the affected staff, and the authorities are currently looking into the manner in which the retrenchment exercise was carried out.

> Jewel Changi Airport may have just opened with a bang in April this year, but it’s already been plagued with several incidents of injuries sustained from accidents at escalators and play areas. On top of that, restaurants that once saw bustling crowds from curious first-time visitors to the multiplex have been struggling for a while to attract post-midnight diners while complying with requirements to keep their doors open till late.

> So the recent operating hours update from Jewel shouldn’t come as a shock. A spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia that all eight eateries on the fifth floor, as well as multiple ones on the Basement 2 level, will shorten their opening hours starting Wednesday (July 10).

> The fifth level food businesses will open from 9am to 1am on Fridays, Saturdays, and the eve of public holidays, and from 10am to midnight from Sundays to Thursdays. A couple stalls at Basement 2 will also axe their 24/7 opening times and close instead around midnight.

> A&W and Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory are among the basement shops that no longer boast 24-hour service.

> This change comes after Jewel Changi Airport Development’s review after discussions with tenants, and will be put into effect along with the timing adjustments for the Canopy Park attractions. The new operating hours are 10am to midnight from Sundays to Thursdays and 10am to 1am for Fridays, Saturdays, and the eve of public holidays.

> The mall currently hosts 111 eateries, including more than 10 with opening hours past midnight and about 30 that are open 24/7.

> This article, Several Jewel Changi Airport eateries to shorten operating hours from 24/7 to midnight closing times, originally appeared on Coconuts, Asia's leading alternative media company. Want more Coconuts? Sign up for our newsletters!

&#x200B;

>TODAY takes a look at some of Mr Al Baker's other comments which have left observers scratching their heads.  
>  
>1.    In July 2017, Mr Al Baker said that American airlines were “crap” and their passengers were ""always being served by grandmothers"", in a speech at a gala dinner to celebrate the launch of a Dublin-Doha route in Ireland. According to a BBC report, he also boasted that the average age of his cabin crew was “only 26"". He later apologised for his remarks and said that they were ""careless"" and did not reflect his ""true sentiments about cabin crew"".  
>  
>2.    At a widely-reported press conference in June last year following his election as chairman of the International Air Transport Association, Mr Al Baker caused a furore when asked about gender diversity among Middle Eastern airlines, and whether his job could be done by a woman. He reportedly answered: “Of course it has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.” He later apologised, saying that he was attempting to make a joke.  
>  
>3.    It is no secret that Mr Al Baker and Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson loathe each other. In fact, Mr Al Baker has even called the latter unethical, unpatriotic and weak. According to media agency Mashable in December 2015, Mr Al Baker said that Mr Anderson’s criticisms of Gulf carriers as ""governments"" were ""nonsense”, with the goal of stifling the competition ""so he can swindle American passengers even more”. The agency also reported that Mr Al Baker said of Mr Anderson: ""Let him come face to face with me in any forum... I will hang him on a wall.”  
>  
>4.    Airline news agency One Mile at a Time reported that when United States President Donald Trump was facing backlash after his remarks suggesting the possibility of banning Muslims from the US, Mr Al Baker was quick to defend him, saying that Mr Trump was his long-time friend. “I think it is an exercise only to gain political mileage. Nothing more. This is the opportune time to excite more extremist people so that they could give him their votes,” he said, according to the report.  
>  
>5.    In May 2016, The Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Al Baker said backpackers were not welcome in Qatar because they “just lie on the beach and don’t spend money” and the country wanted to “attract people of higher standard”. He went on to explain that, unlike neighbouring Dubai, Qatar did not want backpackers as it would give the country a bad look.",t3_drd2wl,04-11-2019

> Singapore did not copy the idea or design for Jewel Changi Airport from anyone.

> Changi Airport Group (CAG) and world-renowned architect Moshe Safdie, who designed the structure that has drawn international acclaim since its opening in April, have hit back at the chief of Qatar Airways, who made the accusation.

> At the unveiling of expansion plans for Qatar’s Hamad International Airport in Doha two weeks ago, Mr Akbar Al Baker said, in an obvious reference to Changi’s Jewel: “When I show you the images later (of the planned enhancements), you will realise that somebody copied our design, which was already on the table nearly six years ago... We had individuals from that country, I will not name it, that took our design and did it.”

> An indoor waterfall and massive gardens are among the features planned that are strikingly similar to what Changi’s Jewel offers.

> Construction is to commence by early next year, Mr Al Baker said.

> Responding to the copycat allegation, CAG chief executive Lee Seow Hiang told The Straits Times yesterday: “We value the originality and creativity of ideas as we innovate to elevate the Changi experience for all our visitors. We respect intellectual property rights and expect the same of all our partners.”

> When Changi embarked on the Jewel project, the mission was to create a game-changing airport experience, he said.

> In July 2012, a competitive process was put in place to seek out the best ideas around the world for an integrated lifestyle complex.

> SINGAPORE - The much-anticipated Jewel Changi Airport, with more than 280 shops and food and beverage outlets, will open its doors to the world on April 17, 2019.

> The 10-storey building, with its distinctive dome-shaped facade made of glass and steel, will also offer aviation facilities.

> This includes early check-in facilities, integrated ticketing and baggage services for fly-cruise and flycoach transfers, all of which will improve the travel experience of travellers, said Dr Lam Pin Min, Senior Minister of State for Transport in Parliament on Thursday (March 7) when he announced its opening date.

> Jewel Changi Airport is sited next to Terminal 1 (T1) and linked to T2 and T3 via air-conditioned linkways fitted with travelators.

> It is designed by architect Moshe Safdie, well-known for his iconic Marina Bay Sands integrated resort.

> In his latest effort, the highlights include a five-storey garden with 2,500 trees and 100,000 shrubs, with two walking trails. There is also a 40m-high Rain Vortex; the world's tallest indoor waterfall.

> A 14,000 sq m Canopy Park - the size of 11 Olympic-size swimming pools - is located on the top floor.

> Related Story New brands, local flavour at Jewel Changi Airport

> Related Story Over 2,000 jobs available at Jewel Changi Airport

> Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir), chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee on Transport, said : ""I must confess that before I visited the Jewel in early February this year, I had my doubts about the need for yet another shopping area at Changi Airport, given the shopping opportunities already available at the existing terminals.

> ""Instead, what I found was a beautifully designed garden concept recreational centre which complements the existing airport and exemplifies our position as a garden city. It will also create many job opportunities for Singaporeans.""

> Responding, Dr Lam said: ""I am happy to hear from Mr Sitoh that he believes Jewel Changi Airport will be a delight for visitors and Singaporeans alike.""

> He added that apart from Jewel, plans are on track for other infrastructure developments at Changi, for example, the construction of the future T5 at Changi East.

> Upgrading works on T2 will also start soon. It will be expanded and refreshed, with automated check-in kiosks, biometric-enabled bag-drops and automated immigration gates, to offer passengers greater convenience from check-in to immigration to their flight, he said.

> A video of the scene posted to Facebook page All Singapore Stuff showed a shower of water raining down from the ceiling, with the floor outside Owndays and Jinjja Chicken stores appearing completely wet.

> A woman can be seen in the background mopping up the water as well.

> In response to Mothership's queries, Jewel Changi Airport revealed that tenants in that area were affected for around 30 minutes.

> The leak was immediately attended to, and operations resumed soon after.

> Jewel added that there was no other disruption to operations.

> More water leakages at Jewel

> This isn't the first time water leakages have occurred at Jewel.

> One incident caused by a sprinkler activation in April 2019 led to multiple floors being wet.

> The first water leakage incident caught on video occurred before the mall's opening on Apr. 17.

ETOPS () is an aviation acronym for Extended Operations.  The term used to signify Extended Range Operation with Two-Engine Airplanes but the meaning was changed when regulations were broadened to include aircraft with more than two engines. It refers to the standards and recommended practices (SARPS) issued by ICAO for aircraft (such as the Airbus A300, A310, A320, A330 and A350, the Boeing 737, 757, 767, 777, 787, the Embraer E-Jets, and the ATR 72) to fly long-distance routes that had been off-limits to twin-engined aircraft, and subsequently to extended range operations of four-engined aircraft (such as the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental).

In aviation vernacular, the colloquial backronym is ""Engines Turn Or Passengers Swim"", referring to the inevitable emergency water landing of a twin engine aircraft after a double engine failure over water outside gliding range of land.

> SINGAPORE: There will soon be no more analogue flight information display boards at Changi Airport, after the the last two of these iconic displays are removed to make way for electronic ones starting from February.

> Also known as Solari boards, after the Italian company that first manufactured them, the displays are being replaced because it is becoming more challenging to maintain them, representatives from the Changi Airport Group told reporters on Thursday (Jan 16).

> The parts have become increasingly difficult to source for, they said.

> 

> CAG said it intends to repurpose the boards, but was unable to provide more details.

> The two boards have been at the departure hall in Terminal 2 since 1999 and are the only ones of their kind left at Changi Airport. The other three terminals are already equipped with electronic displays.

> The board between check-in rows 9 and 10 will be decommissioned in February. The other board will follow suit as part of upgrading and expansion works at the 30-year-old terminal.

> The works, which are scheduled to begin after the Chinese New Year Holidays, will also see the closure of the 16-year-old McDonald's outlet at the Terminal 2 arrival hall. The outlet will close on Jan 31, while the nearby Starbucks will cease operations in April.

> Other restaurants in the public areas of the terminal will remain open until later phases of the upgrading works, CAG said.

> TERMINAL 2 UPGRADING AND EXPANSION

> The works are meant to boost the airport's capacity and improve passenger experience.

> 

> When upgrading is completed in 2024, Terminal 2 will have 15,500 sq m more space, boosting the airport's total capacity by 5 million passengers annually and allowing it to handle up to 90 million passengers a year.

> Works will start with check-in rows 9 to 12 at the departure hall, which means some airlines will be shifted to alternative check-in rows.

> Terminal 2 Rows 9-12 FAST Check-In have already been closed off for renovation works that will start after Chinese New Year. (Photo: Jeremy Long)

> The revamped departure hall will feature a more spacious common-use self-service check-in area with more automated check-in kiosks and bag drop machines. This is expected to increase the passenger handling capacity in the departure hall by up to 20 per cent.

> Both the departure and arrival immigration halls will be expanded to allow for more automated immigration lanes.

> To handle a higher volume of bags, two new baggage belts will be added, bringing the total number of belts to 10. Two existing baggage belts will be lengthened.

> A traveller walks past the baggage arrival conveyor belt at Changi Airport Terminal 2 (Photo: Jeremy Long)

> The early baggage storage system, where bags that are checked in early or where transfer bags with long connection times are stored, will be upgraded from a semi-automatic system to a fully automatic one, allowing about 2,300 bags to be stored at a time.

> The upgrades will also see more greenery incorporated at various parts of the terminal - including the arrival, departure and transit areas - while the Orchid Garden at the departure transit area, which has been in place since 1997, will make way for a new garden with more plant species.

> An artist's impression of the Terminal 2 Departure Transit Hall. (Image: Changi Airport Group)

> A duplex food and beverage area will be introduced at the north end of Terminal 2, leading to Jewel Changi Airport, while a new cluster of food kiosks will be introduced at the south end of the arrival hall.

> Meanwhile more lounge-like waiting areas, similar to those at Terminal 4, will be included at the arrival hall.

> The main contractor for the expansion works is Japanese firm Takenaka Corporation, which constructed Terminal 4 and is responsible for other upgrading works at the airport, including a S$323 million upgrade of Terminal 1 that began in 2015.

> An artist's impression of the Terminal 2 Arrival Hall. (Image: Changi Airport Group)

> The project was designed by J H Boiffils, together with a panel of consultants led by RSP Architects Planners & Engineers.

> CAG did not say how much the upgrading of Terminal 2 would cost.

> Mr Tan Lye Teck, CAG executive vice-president of airport management, noted the terminal would still be operational even as works were ongoing.

> He noted the different phases of upgrading would have to be coordinated to ensure passengers still had “a very nice passage” while travelling through Terminal 2.

> “We’re going to take care to ensure safety, avoid disruption and minimise inconvenience,” he said.

> SINGAPORE: A safety officer and a project manager were sentenced to jail on Wednesday (Sep 23) after a Bangladeshi worker died following a construction accident at Changi Airport more than three years ago.

> 

> Workplace Safety and Health officer Tan Wee Meng was sentenced to two months’ jail, while project manager Lee Chung Ling was sentenced to three months’ jail, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Thursday.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Both men pleaded guilty on Aug 20 for committing negligent acts that endangered the safety of workers who were constructing a high-tension cable conduit along Airport Boulevard at Changi Airport.

> The employer Chan and Chan was fined S$150,000 on Sep 13, 2018 for failing to take practicable measures to ensure the safety and health of its employees.

> 

> On Mar 22, 2017 at about 10.50am, Bangladeshi worker Miah Salim, 43, was inside an excavation pit and erecting the formwork for the construction of the high tension cable conduit.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> At the time of the incident, five other workers were working with Mr Salim, who was the group leader.

> Mr Salim was using a hammer to adjust a wooden horizontal prop – used to support two steel plates – when the prop slipped. This caused one of the steel plates to fall inwards and hit Mr Salim’s chest, said court documents.

> He was later taken to Changi General Hospital, where he died at about 1pm from his injuries.

> 

> As the work safety and health officer, Tan failed to assist Chan and Chan in identifying and assessing the risks arising from the formwork construction methods used by the workers to construct the high-tension cable conduit, said MOM.

> Tan also failed to recommend to the employer “reasonably practicable measures to eliminate foreseeable risks to workers”, added the ministry.

> Lee failed to review the work method and processes for the formwork construction of the conduit and did not ensure the employer appointed a supervisor for formwork activities at the worksite.

> 

> The project manager also did not approve risk assessments and safe work procedures for the use of the metal module formwork at the workplace and failed to ensure the control measures in the risk assessments were implemented.

> 

> According to court documents, the workers were using “an unsafe and unauthorised” method of constructing the formwork with steel plates, something that both Lee and Tan failed to notice.

> At the worksite, the common method for constructing the formwork for the conduit was the metal module formwork and not the conventional framework, said court documents.

> The employer, through Lee and Tan, had approved the use of both the timber formworks and metal module formworks.

> ""The workers had been using metal module formwork to construct the conduit at the workplace for several weeks before the accident,"" said court documents.

> 

> ""The work activity for constructing the conduit using the metal module formwork was not considered in the risk assessment documents. There was also no documented procedure for the use of the metal module formwork.""

> 

> The workers, who did not know the procedures for the methods of constructing the formwork, followed Mr Salim's instructions to do the work, said the court documents.

What does that really mean though? Basically nothing. Lots of risks can be eliminated or mitigated through costly measures. An example would be something like reducing the risk of dying in a traffic accident by driving a tank.

MOM basically the workers, supervisors, safety officers and various managers to bear the risks of their decisions. It anything happens MOM then has the leeway to prosecute as they deem fit.

On one hand, it is the only reasonably practicable (lol) approach for MOM to take. They do not have  the expertise to set out very specific guidelines. Even if they did, the dynamic nature of construction work would make it a nightmare for them to keep up.

and if it’s a changi airport project, that goes double for all the safety measures in place bec they have the money to spend not just on safety officers or managers, but safety consultants. 

so when a construction worker dies bec he did something he wasn’t supposed to do, 

a) was he properly briefed, ie in his language, with demonstrations, etc 

b) was he given proper safety equipment

c) were there enough safety officers to oversee/monitor the work

d) was a trade demonstration executed for the work involved 

e) was there a method statement provided for the work involved

f) were the works reviewed by a safety consultant 

g) were all safety measures in place

safety in a construction site is no joke, and if something like this is truly missed out resulting in death, there must have been a lapse in the process, the process that the managers are responsible for, in order for this to happen.

It all begins with safety culture. An accident does not happen just because that one day the guy decides not to follow the safety guidelines. More likely there were a few near misses, the guy was reprimanded a few times but nothing serious happened, so they carry on until something really happens.

In a plant, if you are caught doing something dangerous you are out - you’re never going to be allowed in again. It is because they are so strict that contractors are constantly walking on eggshells and come down hard on their own workers. But also the whole Jurong island hasn’t burned down yet so I guess there’s merit in doing things that way.

I’m no authority on this, only attended some safety meetings where the manager plotted out near misses as a trend that will lead to disaster, which I thought was quite interesting.",t3_iyy1yg,25-09-2020

> SINGAPORE - Lotte Duty Free's new liquor and tobacco stores at Changi Airport will be the company's largest operations in the Asia-Pacific, its chief executive officer Kap Lee said on Tuesday (June 9) when the South Korean company took over the concession from DFS.

> Lotte is also expanding its product line-up progressively, and will eventually offer more than 3,000 wines and spirits that are tax- and duty-free, it said in a joint media statement with Changi Airport Group on Tuesday (June 9).

> The South Korean company won the tender for the airport's liquor and tobacco concession, becoming its first new operator with DFS Group pulling out of the business after 38 years.

> Lotte will first retail on Changi Airport's duty-free e-commerce platform, iShopChangi.com, before its physical shops open. To celebrate the start of its operations, Lotte is offering a 7 per cent discount on some products from June 12 to 30, on top of tax- and duty-absorbed prices. Shoppers will also receive a 5 per cent discount voucher for their next in-store purchase.

> Singapore residents can also shop selected Lotte products on iShopChangi without flying.

> ""Apart from a complete revamp of store designs, passengers can also look forward to an omni-channel experience as we integrate a seamless brick-and-mortar shopping experience with e-commerce,"" said Ms Lim Peck Hoon, CAG's executive vice-president, commercial.

> Renovation works for Lotte's stores will begin in phases once Singapore's circuit-breaker restrictions are lifted, starting in Terminals 1 and 3.

> Its physical stores' design concept will feature ""innovative in-store technologies"" and integrate ""elements of nature"" inspired by the airport's gardens, the companies said. There will be a high-tech tasting bar, immersive experience zones dedicated to whisky, gin and wine, as well as a specialised cognac brand boutique.

> Lotte's range of brands and products will include limited-edition whiskies and cognacs, exclusive labels only available at Changi Airport, a collection of Asian spirits highlighting brands from Singapore and South Korea, as well as alcohol-free options.

> Resist the urge to attack it with a broom or stick. Do not confront the snake and keep your distance away from the snake. The snake may try to look for a dark and secure area and you should observe to see where it hides, so that it can be removed by professionals. Make sure that young children and pets like dogs or cats are kept away from the room or area where the snake is, as they may be curious and try to approach the snake. Close all doors in the room, except for those that lead to the outside like your balcony, patio or front doors. Sometimes the snake will look for an escape route and will use these openings. If the snake is in the garden, spray it gently with a water hose to send it on its way while keeping your distance. This will persuade the snake to leave the area. If you find a snake in your pool, you can use a long handled leaf skimmer to gently remove the snake, as it may not be able to get out on its own if it is small or exhausted from swimming. If the snake is in an open area like the floor and not moving much, the best thing to do is to place an object over it like a heavy blanket or towel. Hold the towel/blanket in front of you when approaching it, and then firmly cast it over the snake. The snake should immediately calm down and will feel secure if it cannot see what is going on outside the blanket. If possible, place heavy objects around the edge to prevent the snake from slipping out from underneath the towel/blanket and escaping. This will buy you some time to get help. If the snake is found in a drawer, behind furniture or somewhere difficult to access, leave it alone; move all family members away from the immediate area and, most of all, do not attempt to interact with it at all. Call for professional help. Have someone to keep an eye on the snake from a safe distance and note where it goes into hiding while you are contacting for help. Next, find out why the snake came to your area. Do you keep rodents or birds? Are there birds nesting in your garden, do you have a rodent problem in the house or garden? Some snakes prey on small mammals like rabbits, rats and cats, as well as birds and amphibians.

> The Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres) has reminded the public not to handle wild animals or capture them. This reminder comes after an incident where a few men were seen capturing a python at Changi Beach on Nov 15. The incident, which happened at 11am, was caught on video by Stomperwho was at the beach with his family when the python appeared out of nowhere.""Everyone was enjoying their day at the beach when a python suddenly appeared from a hole near the roots of a large tree,"" said Razlee. ""My daughters were really excited to see a snake in the open but I made sure they didn't get too close. ""I also heard passers-by telling swimmers to get out of the water as it was high tide and the water started flowing towards the trees."" Razlee added that he was surprised to see a snake at the beach and was glad that this did not happen at night. ""At least this happened in the morning so the snake could be clearly seen,"" Razlee said. ""I'm glad that a few men stepped up and helped to capture the snake. These men caught the snake pretty quickly and placed it in a net while waiting for Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) personnel to arrive.""In response to a Stomp query, Mr Kalai Vanan, deputy chief executive officer of Acres said: ""The snake is a reticulated python which seems to be about 2.5m to 3m. This native species can be found islandwide here in Singapore."" Mr Kalai added that Acres was not involved in the rescue operation. ""From the photos and videos, it seems that members of the public took matters into their own hands to capture the snake,"" said Mr Kalai. ""Acres would like to urge the public to never attempt to capture wild animals such as snakes on their own. Instead, they can help to control crowds and monitor the animal. ""Without proper training which includes animal welfare aspects, you may hurt yourself, people around you and the animal itself through improper handling. ""If you see any wild animal(s) in distress, please call the 24-hr ACRES wildlife rescue hotline at 97837782 or National Parks Board (NParks).""

> SINGAPORE — A 27-year-old Swedish man, of Syrian background, jumped at the chance to help his older brother escape from war-torn Syria.

> In return, Suliman Karim was required to help facilitate the transit of two other Syrian nationals through Changi Airport by providing them with boarding passes for flights for which Karim had checked in using his own Swedish passport.

> However, the plans — arranged by an intermediary back in Sweden — were unravelled by an Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer, and all three men were prevented from boarding their respective flights out of Singapore.

> On Wednesday (June 26), Karim was sentenced in the State Courts to four months’ imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to one charge of a criminal conspiracy for another person to impersonate him.

> Two other similar charges were taken into consideration. Karim’s sentence was backdated to March 30 this year, the date of his remand.

> LOVE FOR HIS BROTHER

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Victoria Ting told the court that prior to being caught, Karim had entered Singapore on two other occasions to carry out the instructions of a man he had met in Sweden last year.

> Ms Ting did not elaborate on what these earlier instructions were, or when the previous occasions were, but she said that Karim had been introduced to an individual known only as Abu Jihad by another Swedish national, Sameer Sharab.

> In his mitigation plea, defence lawyer Eric Tin said Karim had moved from Syria to Sweden with his mother in 2007 but his older brother had remained in Syria.

> Syria has been engulfed in an ongoing civil war since 2011. Mr Tin said that Karim’s mother was getting worried for his brother’s safety.

> A solution presented itself when Karim told Abu Jihad about his brother’s plight when they met.

> Sometime later, Abu Jihad told Karim that he could get his brother out of Syria for free, but he needed some “favours” to be carried out in Singapore in return.

> Abu Jihad promised that he would arrange for Karim's flight tickets and lodgings in Singapore. All Karim needed to do was to show up in Stockholm with his passport so that he could take a photo of it.

> Karim arrived in Singapore from Sweden for the third time on March 25 this year, when he stayed in an unnamed hotel until the morning of March 28.

> SNEAKY HANDOVER

> That morning, Karim received not only his own flight booking details for his journey back to Sweden, but he also received the flight details for two Syrians, Omar Mohammad Hussein and Sewar Mirza Abdalla. The pair admitted Abu Jihad had been paid US$5,000 (S$6,771) to arrange their transportation out of Syria.

> One ticket was for Hussein to fly to Stockholm, while the other was for Abdalla to fly to Berlin.

> Both tickets were in Karim’s name.

> Ms Ting said Karim had entered Changi Airport’s Terminal 2 that day at about 6pm, following Abu Jihad’s instructions, and used his passport to check in for both flights and printed the boarding passes.

> He then went to the transit area, and with the boarding passes in hand, Karim arranged for Abdalla to meet him in one of the airport’s toilets.

> Ms Ting said that Karim had placed the boarding pass for Abdalla’s flight on a basin when no one was looking and taught him how to read it, and identify the flight number and so forth.

> Abdalla had been provided with a counterfeit Greek passport bearing Karim’s name.

> Abdalla was caught by the ICA when he presented the boarding pass, along with the counterfeit passport bearing Karim’s name to a SATS security officer.

> Details for Hussein were not read out in court, but court documents mentioned that a counterfeit Belgian passport was also recovered.

> In pleading for a lighter sentence for Karim, Mr Tin said that his client’s role was limited to collecting and handing the boarding passes to Hussein and Abdalla.

> “There is nothing sophisticated or complicated in what he did,” said Mr Tin.

> He added that Karim is not a member of any transnational migrant syndicate, nor were there any terrorism elements in this case.

> His client, he said, was neither well off nor highly-educated, so he did not think through carefullly the consequences of his actions.

> “Mr Karim only wanted to help his brother out of Syria to reunite with their family in Sweden. Blood is thicker than water.”

> Karim could have been punished with imprisonment for up to five years and fined, or received both a fine and a jail term.

1. ~~15%~~ 18% of the Swedish population is foreign-born.
2. Yugoslavia and Syria account for the highest number of immigrants, ~ 170,000 each. That's about 2% each, of total population.
3. 5 of the top 10 immigrant populations are from Muslim-majority counties, which account for ~500,000. That's 5% of the total population.

It's easy to say Sweden is 'overrun' by certain groups of people, but Syrians as such are just 2%. They might be conflated with the larger 5% of brown 'muslim-lookin' fellers', but really the numbers don't indicate a massive influx.

[Here's a quick and dirty pie chart of the different immigrant populations](https://i.imgur.com/GRBdNCF.png)

edit: for accuracy

**Edit for deeper commentary:**

So the numbers for Yugoslavia is actually a sum of people from Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia and Bosnia & Herzegovina. So it stands to reason that Syrians are indeed the largest immigrant group of a particular nationality, at 2%.

Also, the Syrian population is concentrated in just a few areas, which blew in just this decade, which accounts for the perceived influx of foreigners in those regions. There's also the inevitable discussions around integration that emphasize the ""influx"" narrative.",t3_c5pzdv,27-06-2019

> SINGAPORE - A maid was working for Changi Airport Group chairman Liew Mun Leong and his family when she stole more than $34,000 worth of items from them.

> They included luxury watches such as a $10,000 Gerald Genta watch, 115 pieces of clothing worth $150 each, as well as two iPhones with accessories valued at more than $2,000.

> After a 20-day trial, District Judge Olivia Low found Indonesian Parti Liyani, 45, guilty of four counts of theft on Wednesday (March 20). She will be sentenced on Monday.

> A fifth charge of being in possession of items, including multiple ez-link cards and wallets which are suspected of being fraudulently obtained, has been stood down for now and will be dealt with at a later stage.

> Judge Low said Parti had stolen from Mr Liew, his two children Karl Liew and Liew Cheng May, as well as from Mr Karl Liew's wife, Madam Heather Lim.

> The domestic helper started working at the family's house in Chancery Lane, off Dunearn Road, in March 2007. Her monthly salary was $600 by the time she stopped working for them on Oct 28, 2016.

> Judge Low said: ""The accused was not badly treated and admitted that she had a cordial relationship with the Liew family, and they often gave her generous red packets on special and festive occasions.""

> She added that over the years, Mr Liew Mun Leong discovered that items had gone missing from the household and suspected that Parti had stolen them.

> He finally decided to terminate her employment in October 2016.

> As he was overseas, he asked Mr Karl Liew to oversee the maid's termination and repatriation to Indonesia.

> On Oct 28 that year, Mr Karl Liew told Parti that she would no longer be working for the family and gave her about three hours to pack her belongings.

> She was also given two to three months' salary as compensation.

> Related Story Maid accused of stealing said she salvaged items from trash bags

> Related Story Husband felt thefts had been going on for years

> Judge Low said: ""The accused demanded to know the reason for her termination and got upset with Karl, even to the extent of accusing him of being a very bad person and that God would punish him.""

> Parti later demanded that he pay for three jumbo boxes of items to be shipped to her home and he agreed.

> The maid then left the house without taking the boxes and returned to Indonesia.

> Madam Lim later voiced her concern to her husband that it would not be prudent to ship the boxes back to Parti without knowing their contents.

> This was because they had to declare the contents of what was being shipped. The boxes were opened and they discovered many of their belongings inside.

> A police report was later made after Mr Liew Mun Leong returned to Singapore.

> Parti returned to Singapore on Dec 2, 2016, as she wanted to continue working here but was arrested upon arrival. She was charged in court on Aug 31, 2017.

> During the trial, the maid testified that she had found Mr Karl Liew's Gerald Genta watch in a black trash bag.

> He, however, had said he did not throw it away but later realised that it had gone missing.

> On Wednesday, Judge Low said: ""There was no reason for Karl to discard such an expensive watch and thus I preferred Karl's version to that of the accused.""

> Parti also testified that she had found the iPhones in a rubbish bag.

> However, Mr Karl Liew said he did not discard the devices, as they were handy as spare phones when travelling.

> Madam Lim also testified that Parti had earlier asked her for the phones but she had refused to sell them.

> The judge said: ""It was simply not conceivable that Karl and Heather would refuse to sell the iPhones to the accused but yet discard the iPhones with the SIM cards still intact.""

> Parti is out on bail of $10,000. According to earlier reports in The Straits Times, she is now staying at a shelter run by migrant workers group, Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (Home).

> Her lawyer, Mr Anil Balchandani, was approached by Home to represent her pro bono.

> For each count of theft, she can be jailed for up to seven years and fined.

> Singapore has reported a record-high 728 daily new Covid-19 cases on April 16.

> In total, Singapore currently has 4,427 cases.

> With the steep increase in Covid-19 cases, mostly coming from foreign workers' dormitories, the country is preparing more spaces to house patients who do not require hospital care to free up those resources.

> Besides Singapore Expo, the government has also created community care facilities at army camps, vacant HDB car parks, and Changi Exhibition Centre (CEC).

> Changi Exhibition Centre getting ready to house Covid-19 patients

> Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean shared on Facebook several images of Changi Exhibition Centre being converted into a community care facility to house Covid-19 patients who are recovering from the disease or only show mild symptoms.

> Photos show the 40,000m² indoor exhibition hall at CEC, an Airshow site, having been furnished with basic furniture.

> In his post, Teo also thanked public officers and various industry partners for their hard work to get the space ready.

> ""Many thanks to all our public officers and private and public sector partners from the exhibition, hospitality, dormitory & medical sectors, and MINDEF-affiliated organisations, SAFRA, NSRCC and SAF clubs and associations for stepping up & working tirelessly over the past 10 days to prepare the CEC to look after our patients""

> Here's an aerial view of the living quarters:

> There's a cupboard, power plug and fan near each bed as well.

> Every patient will also receive a welfare pack, which includes essential items such as face masks, thermometer, toilet paper, detergent powder, and a bottle of mineral water.

> To ensure the safety of the staff caring for the patients at CEC, some robots have been deployed, such as this BeamPro Telepresence Robot that allows staff to communicate with the patients and attend to their needs.

> The ST Engineering’s STrobo Tug robots will also be used to transport prepared meals to the patients.

5089,17,fnmauf0,t1_fnm96m5,are you the kind that would rather die than let people see your dick or pussy?,t3_g2it6l,16-04-2020
5090,17,fnmevph,t1_fnm96m5,Agree maybe they could try and move people into hotels with king size bed and jacuzzi for maximum privacy. Only the rooms facing the sea will be used and two butlers are assigned to you on a rotation basis together with a chef specialising in cuisine of your choice. A team of doctors and nurses will also be assigned to each patient to prevent cross contamination and so that they don't have to travel too much because now all the patients are spread out due to privacy,t3_g2it6l,16-04-2020
5091,17,fnn02fa,t1_fnm96m5,"People are giving you shit but I agree. Definitely not going to get tested unless respiratory problems kick in. That place looks horrible to a spoiled person like me. And keep in mind you'll be there for almost a month until totally recovered. It's also a good incentive to follow the CB rules...

I do wonder though whether they will triage the patients and mainly send the foreign construction workers there.",t3_g2it6l,16-04-2020
5092,17,fnmlqm6,t1_fnlw4dd,I think he was asking about the number of beds there.,t3_g2it6l,16-04-2020
5093,17,fnmj8ka,t1_fnlw4dd,So two people in one bed?,t3_g2it6l,16-04-2020
5094,17,fnlv8tw,t1_fnlrnx6,"> each room has 10 beds

Is this really different from the dorms, other than that there's a bit more space, and constant monitoring?",t3_g2it6l,16-04-2020
5095,17,fnnqkko,t1_fnmauf0,"Nope. Imagine if you just experience mild symptoms and you have to stay in a place like this. You can sit on your high horse now and make a joke out of what I say. However when shit happens and you/your spouse is there, I guess it wouldn’t be funny to you anymore.",t3_g2it6l,17-04-2020

5098,17,fnnr1gq,t1_fnn02fa,"These idiots have not worked in healthcare and they obviously wouldn’t know what patients on the ground might be thinking. It’s funny how they bash me but I’m looking forward to the moment when they or their loved ones are there. Probably they will be the first one to kpkb and start getting all entitled out of a sudden. 

Easy to sit on your high horse and judge what others say. Fucking hypocrites, that’s what most redditors are.",t3_g2it6l,17-04-2020

Maybe YOU should get off your high horse and learn some humility. Stop acting like some entitled prick.",t3_g2it6l,17-04-2020
5101,17,fnnr5m6,t1_fnnbvvc,You can say that but I’m really looking forward to you &/or your loved ones being housed there. I would like to see irl what a choosing beggar would look like.,t3_g2it6l,17-04-2020
5102,17,fnmsgns,t1_fnm48a8,Also the fact that it's no longer an issue as there won't be mixing of infected and non-infected people. It's just like one big ward which is fine (as well as realistic) for this scenario.,t3_g2it6l,16-04-2020
5103,17,fnq4t7s,t1_fnns2q5,"Joker, make sure you walk your talk then. The number one self entitled prick is always the majority of Singaporeans. You obviously have no idea what a high horse means. If I’m on my fucking high horse I will be agreeing mindlessly like you to every measures or policy implemented. 

Obviously you are one of those Singaporeans that doesn’t have to deal with the majority of the public when this kind of crisis strikes. So obviously you couldn’t grasp what I’ve mentioned. Enjoying your good life indeed.",t3_g2it6l,17-04-2020

5106,17,fnnsvyo,t1_fnnr5m6,Yep. Cursing people is definitely the way to go. That shows the kind of person you are.,t3_g2it6l,17-04-2020
