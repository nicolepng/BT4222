> The first one they claim a mishap happened with the rider, but prior to my expected delivery time he was chilling at chai chee for 15 mins.

Also just wanted to point out that he might not have been chilling but involved in an accident, which would explain why he was in the same spot for a long time.",t3_948xu9,03-08-2018
1,16,e3j8gmj,t3_948xu9,"wow i have had the opposite experience with deliveroo actually. once the restaurant prepared a wrong item and they refunded the value of that item no questions asked. another time the order was late, i wasn’t able to pick up their call cos i was at work. i think they gave me 3 missed calls. they gave me a $25 credit which was almost the order cost and i still got my food.

3,16,e3j53pz,t3_948xu9,Easy mate. Go to their office and do a sit in. Make shit viral.,t3_948xu9,03-08-2018
4,16,e3ks1ry,t3_948xu9,Stop patronizing them. ,t3_948xu9,04-08-2018
5,16,e3orlbt,t3_948xu9,TBH at least they owned up and apologized. Not like some other services. ,t3_948xu9,06-08-2018
6,16,e3j4tn1,t3_948xu9,"They even claimed to try and contact me but when I picked up the call, lo and behold, they hung up on me. The call wasn’t even ringing for long, barely one second into my ringtone and I picked it up. 

When I contacted customer service they claim a mishap happened with my order. Thinking it strange for two orders in a row to mess up I asked for details on why there was a mishap. They then proceed to say that no notes were recorded from the rider and thus can’t tell me what happened.

But suddenly, after questioning them for a while longer, they suddenly claim that they tried to contact me and my order was picked up by another rider and thus not deliverable. 

So where does the two orders go? Do they throw it away? Two perfectly good about $70 orders? Just because one rider was somewhere in chai chee doing god knows what and another picked up the wrong order? 

I don’t believe that two mishaps can happen like this within two hours with something as simple as “oh a mishap happened we tried contacting you sorry you didn’t pick up so your food is gone now.”

Does anybody else have problems with Deliveroo such as this? Is it only Deliveroo? Why does this happen? Is the boss of all this just sitting on his chair in his office enjoying his millions of dollars without changing the problems we have down here?

7,16,e3jcnnb,t3_948xu9,"I kena the same thing before but as a rider (i.e. another rider took my order before i reached the restaurant), the restaurant quickly cooked a fresh order for me when they realised what has happened. ",t3_948xu9,03-08-2018
8,16,e3j5l1u,t3_948xu9,Shit always happens when all their riders are freelancers.,t3_948xu9,03-08-2018
9,16,e3l78bq,t3_948xu9,"This is what you call unscalable business. Ok if you can get a few kum gong kia to do the deliveries, but when the novelty wears off, you would need to depend on an army of cheap monkeys to fill in.

India also has a system like that - more advanced than deliveroo yet provides sustainable livelihood.",t3_948xu9,04-08-2018
10,16,e3jjlba,t1_e3je5y3,"Same. 

One time I ordered noodles to my In laws place. Put the wrong block no. Then left my phone on silent, so I didnt pick up when they called.

1hr latter was wondering why the food wasnt here, looked at phone and realised what went wrong. Contacted their customer service and they gave me credit for my order. (They also offered to reverse the charges on the credit card but they said that process will take a few days) 

Overall, I've been rather lucky with deliveroo. ",t3_948xu9,03-08-2018
