4,13,Fight at MacPherson MRT platform,0,7tsf87,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7tsf87/fight_at_macpherson_mrt_platform/,10,29-01-2018,"Witnessed 2 men having an argument at yellow line platform of MacPherson MRT. One (A) had a cap, black short hair, T-shirt, shorts, slingbag. Normal build, a little short-ish (reference: I'm about 174cm). The other (B) was wearing spectacles, jeans, about same height as me.

Argument heated up, and I saw A put his slingbag down on a nearby bench and move to punch B. Don't recall clearly but have a vague impression that B was turning away and A struck him unawares. 

Short scuffle ensued, blows were traded. B's spectacles broke. During a short cessation, B spoke to A, saying, ""Walk away lah"", and A replied, ""You want to fight right?"" B walked away shortly after, while A taunted him with calls of ""Pussy"", and ""No balls"".

Wtf guys, it's an MRT station. The great galloping bollocks of A to actually start a fight, there! 

Anyway, so this shit happened, and if any witnesses or parties are willing to chime in...feel free.
