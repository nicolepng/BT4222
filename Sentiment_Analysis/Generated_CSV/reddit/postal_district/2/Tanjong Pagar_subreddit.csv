I have to say I remember the grand halls of Tanjong Pagar and perhaps whenever the KTM train passedby mindef HQ, it lowkey felt like a big fuck you to SG from MY as even a defence offical from SG had to stop for a MY train.


Side note: Kuala Lumpur train station was actually built to withstand 3 months of snow on its roof. i wonder if Tanjong pagar was the same."

Both are the second and fourth largest swing after West Coast (26.88%). Bukit Panjang is the third (14.64%)

Of course we know West Coast was because of TCB's effect.

Any ideas what's happening in both CCK and TP?

CCK: Is it because of unhappiness about government's handling of Covid-19, directed to Minister of Health Gan Kim Yong who is the anchor minister of CCK

TP: Chan Chun Sing is too unpopular? Indranee is not a Chinese?

I think PSP's team in both GRCs are average to decent."

We were informed earlier today, 18 March 2020, that a Virgin Active member has tested positive for Coronavirus (COVID-19). The member visited Virgin Active Tanjong Pagar on the 16th March, and has not visited since.  

As of today 18th March, we have carried out a deep clean and thorough disinfection at Virgin Active Tanjong Pagar. Further to this, all common areas such as lifts and toilets in the building are also being treated in accordance with Ministry of Health guidelines.
We have also organized for an NEA approved company to come in to disinfect the entire club this evening, 18th March.

In conjunction with this confirmation, a specialist team from Ministry of Health is in the process of conducting detailed contact tracing with all employees, members, freelancers, contracts and other parties that the member may have come in contact with.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) has advised that Virgin Active Tanjong Pagar can continue to operate as normal, therefore this club will remain open as per standard operating hours.

Yes, they did stupid shit but they paid for it with their lives. We can leave it at that.

There's a lot of stuff being dug up right now from their social media that are being interpreted in various different ways, and some being downright distasteful. The fact that they are deceased means they can't defend themselves from all these attacks as the family members may not have a way to disable their Insta."
