The only real thing I remember about Carrefour was they had this super fucking big Rotisserie chicken cooking oven and I would stand there and just watch it spin and spin while the chicken juices drip down.

""Will wearing a mask help to reduce the transmission of the virus? Should I wear a surgical mask or a N95 mask?


Masks are generally not needed for people who are well.  

If you are unwell, it is advisable for you to wear a surgical mask as it will help reduce the spread of the virus and it is also more practical for general public to use as compared to an N95 mask. Surgical masks can help block large-particle droplets and splatter from reaching the wearer’s mouth and nose, and reduce exposure of the wearer’s saliva and respiratory secretions to others.""

Thus they spread the virus everywhere they go especially in crowded train and buses. When you speak (not counting a cough or a sneeze which brings the virus further) loads of virus laden saliva are spitted out...some so tiny they're hard to discern. So if anyone tells me not necessary to wear a mask if you're healthy is really foolish advice when there's an epidemic. 

I have had conversation with a colleague who didn't wear a mask while having a flu and I was sitting more than 45cm directly opposite him resulted in me catching the flu soon after.
So when there's an epidemic (flu or cold or coronavirus) wear a mask in crowded places whether you are healthy or sick. An N95 mask offers better protection than the surgical mask due to its tighter design.",t3_evidev,29-01-2020

It's been established that masks are necessary obly for those who have respiratory symptoms: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/wuhan-virus-mask-necessary-only-for-those-with-respiratory-symptoms-stresses-chief-of

The same advice is listed on MOH: https://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhan/faqs

If say, you have strong distrust of local media, it's also been stated by foreign health experts that wearing a mask is ""not likely to be very effective in preventing it (spread of the coronavirus)"". https://www.businessinsider.sg/wuhan-coronavirus-face-masks-not-entirely-effective-2020-1/?r=US&IR=T

If say, you are still not convinced, here's another source, again from a (different) foreign health expert, who states ""Although there is a perception that the wearing of facemasks may be beneficial, there is in fact very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use outside of these clinical setting."" https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51205344",t3_evidev,29-01-2020
165,1,ffwv373,t1_ffwtrr9,"1. False information? Please note that the virus can be transmitted even if the host does not show any symptoms - cough and flu. It can spread via eye and nose mucus. It is during the incubation period that the spread becomes stronger. And why are doctors and nurses wearing masks given that they aren’t sick? Does that logic not make sense to you that we should too?

2. By not wearing mask and only expecting individuals who are sick (presuming that they are even aware) to exercise social responsibility, aren’t you being ignorant? 

3. I am not saying that wearing masks will immediately stop the spread. But at least it still HELPS coupled with exercising personal hygiene. Everyone has a part to play and the least we can do is to contribute (even if it helps in the most smallest way possible). 


If you want links, please get on to youtube. Plenty of videos on it.

Edit: anyway, enough of trying to make sense with you. Carry on not wearing a mask if that makes you feel any better. Like what they say, ignorance is bliss.",t3_evidev,29-01-2020

The general public isn't. Source: https://www.prevention.com/health/a30677242/can-face-mask-prevent-coronavirus/

And, can you also state where you learnt that the virus is transmitted via eye mucus from? Reddit? ""Helpful"" Whatsapp messages? The Daily Mail, well known for its sensationalist news grounded in a lack of fact-checking? Again, you need to learn how to verify whatever you read before spreading false information. Seriously. You may be ignorant but it's socially irresponsible to spread fake news like this.

2) Your sentence doesn't make sense in many ways. How can an individual who is unaware that they are sick exercise social responsibility by wearing a mask to begin with? Why does not wearing a mask make me ignorant when I have already listed out, with credible sources and quotes, that surgical masks are not designed to protect against infection?

The term ""computer"", in use from the early 17th century (the first known written reference dates from 1613), meant ""one who computes"": a person performing mathematical calculations, before electronic computers became commercially available. ""The human computer is supposed to be following fixed rules; he has no authority to deviate from them in any detail."" Teams of people were frequently used to undertake long and often tedious calculations; the work was divided so that this could be done in parallel.

Since the end of the 20th century, the term ""human computer"" has also been applied to individuals with prodigious powers of mental arithmetic, also known as mental calculators.

A difference engine is an automatic mechanical calculator designed to tabulate polynomial functions. The name derives from the method of divided differences, a way to interpolate or tabulate functions by using a small set of polynomial coefficients. Most mathematical functions commonly used by engineers, scientists and navigators, including logarithmic and trigonometric functions, can be approximated by polynomials, so a difference engine can compute many useful tables of numbers.

The historical difficulty in producing error-free tables by teams of mathematicians and human ""computers"" spurred Charles Babbage's desire to build a mechanism to automate the process.

It could be a single person responsible but I doubt it.

304,1,fyqibyz,t1_fyqd5t7,"But these are our speculations. There is no press report that there are 4 cases simply because the food court appears 4 times in the linked press report or MOH press release.

In fact My Kampung [appeared 8 times](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-c0d0da465d65e4c48bbbf1a908e4775e8.pdf) when it was first reported. IMO, I think the same person visited My Kampung all those times, likely because he works there and frequents that food court for his meals?

The onsen spa case likely another person because of the time gap between the Kallang Wave Mall cases.

Again, this are just my speculations.

As for the Fernvale gym, thanks for linking the press report!

>The ActiveSG Gym at Fernvale Square appears thrice on the list over four days. According to statutory board Sport Singapore, which runs ActiveSG gyms, a COVID-19 case had visited the Fermvale gym on three occasions.

These tables are summarized from the annex C's provided by MOH daily, my guess being the font and formats are the same. The press helps by identifying the newly added rows as compared to the previous days. [The gym appears three times.](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-c-(19-jul).pdf)

MOH started releasing their annex C's with these places listed on [25 May](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-c9743c2cf44ac4f0e8f6ccac3d2f45b4d.pdf), it was still during the circuit breaker.
