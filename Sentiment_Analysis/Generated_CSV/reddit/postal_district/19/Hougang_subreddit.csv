Translation:
Residents asked why I'm retiring despite being relatively young. I have to explain I'm not retiring and will be still around but making way as MP for someone younger.

If I wait for another five years, my successor is older by five years as well. We must make a decision as the problem (of succession) will come back again.

Hence when the opportunity came with a suitable successor, we must act on it.

But Alunied-Hougang only received a puny amount in 2016.

We knew that opposition wards were punished for their votes, but this was the first smoking gun I saw. From people around me, I knew that last 10 years, Aljunied-Hougang's rubbish disposable services, playgrounds, parks, and lifts were lowered in quality. Rubbish piled up and they were slow to clear. Playgrounds were rebuilt with fewer structures and games. Parks were ""renovated"" but looked worse than before. Lifts were replaced with a noisy and unreliable Sigma brand. Some of these may not be related to Town Council funding but I am unsure. 

Someone else in the know may enlighten us?
