6,19,Any sightings of a monkey in Serangoon Gardens?,1,dbbmo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/dbbmo6/any_sightings_of_a_monkey_in_serangoon_gardens/,6,30-09-2019,"Quite recently, a monkey was found feasting on the bananas on the banana tree at my grandma’s place ( which, it was her tree no flex intended ) and she was so frantic about it that she accidentally fell and broke her arm (she’s fine now ). And then 

Oh no! The wild monkey fled!

And began feasting on the mango tree outside her place. I don’t know what happened but presuming that it fled after eating the mangoes, it’s likely that it “da-baoed” the mango and scurried off

She then called NEA and they said it was a stray monkey( it was only one )

I’m curious if any of you have seen it and I hope that the monkey found it’s way back into the forest

Side note: Monkeys have never been spotted here and my grandma has been living there for 40+ years"
