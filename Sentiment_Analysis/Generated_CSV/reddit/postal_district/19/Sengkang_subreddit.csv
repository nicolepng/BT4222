Need some leads or help finding a Min Jian Kueh stall in Sengkang that my family has lost touch with!,639,j4s434,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/j4s434/hey_sg_need_some_leads_or_help_finding_a_min_jian/,61,04-10-2020,"UPDATE: THE STALL HAS BEEN FOUND! Refer to my update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/j78eaf/the\_min\_jian\_kueh\_stall\_has\_been\_found/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/j78eaf/the_min_jian_kueh_stall_has_been_found/)

&#x200B;

Hi everyone! Sorry if the title is super ridiculous, but hear me out: I need help finding a stall that sells min jian kueh that's supposedly somewhere in Sengkang, in a kopitiam.

My family and I frequent Hup Seng Duck Rice in the kopitiam at Sin Ming Road - my parents went there when they were dating and have continued to do so repeatedly each week even now (with me in tow, of course). There used to be a Min jian kueh stall - QQ Pancake - and it was a part of my teenage years. I can't remember when it opened, say maybe 2010/2011 ish? I do remember that it closed down right before I entered university so that's about 2015 or maybe 2014.

This min jian kueh stall was run by a middle-aged (though now probably qualifies as elderly) couple. The uncle is really tall, back in the day he would always be dressed in a polo tee and in bermudas with sandals. He has a very lovely smile (that I would like to hope has been retained over the years). His wife is a lovely lady too, short hair with a bob cut last I remember. Their min jian kueh was AMAZING and I miss it very much. They sell your classic ""cut slice"" min jian kueh (the one with the crust on the sides, and is folded) as well as what I call the ""crescent moon"" or ""curry puff"" pancake, which is like a small round pancake folded into half with help of a press/mould. Y'all I can't describe how amazing their min jian kueh was, I've tried at least 20 over stalls in my entire life but this one is still the best for me.

Uncle told me a long time ago before they closed that they actually had another branch at Sengkang. Gave my mom the namecard but as you can guess, it has been misplaced (therefore this post). He mentioned that his Sengkang branch was much more popular and many more people went, so I'm asking here in the hopes that any one of you might know where this shop is. It should be in a kopitiam, and if I remember correctly, near the shopping mall (Compass One).

Please let me know if you've any idea - a guess would be helpful too! I've been scouring Google but no one has written about this shop (I guess min jian kueh isn't something that people review often) but my family would very much like to be able to reconnect with this couple and to have their min jian kueh again.

Thanks so much and have a lovely day everyone!

Edits & Additional Details:

The uncle and aunty are fluent in both English and Mandarin! The min jian kueh back in the sin ming branch was always served with the brown food paper (yknow the one when you buy economical bee hoon or like chicken rice)? And yeah, it's QQ because their dough is super chewy!! A quick Google of the shop name (QQ Vegetarian Pancake) will show you a registered address that points to their branch at Sin Ming (which has closed) so this might mean that their Sengkang branch was of a different name, I'm not sure. Additional Note: They only sold the pancake and nothing else! It was their niche I suppose.

The aunty was also the one who manned most of the Sengkang stall till 2014-2015, the uncle was the one who did the work at Sin Ming. But since the Sin Ming one closed and I remember him saying he was gonna help his wife, they probably operate as a couple!

List of Places:

Kopitiam Square (Apparently there's no MJK stall here)

266 Compassvale Bow (Also has apparently closed, stall run by an uncle and aunty who also specialise in doing Popiah sets and Rojak)

303 Anchorvale Link (run also by an uncle and aunty, they sell in the morning)

267B Compassvale Kopitiam (this is called Happy Hawkers!)"

_____________________________________________

Dear Residents of Sengkang GRC

It has been a week since you exercised your vote for the Workers' Party team to be your MPs. We wish to provide an interim update on the take over of Sengkang Town from the existing town councils. 

The takeover process for the newly created Sengkang GRC requires us to work with two existing Town Councils: Ang Mo Kio TC (AMKTC) for Anchorvale, and Pasir Ris-Punggol TC (PRPTC) for Punggol East and Sengkang Central. The Sengkang MPs-elect have informed the Ministry of National Development that we intend to run Sengkang TC on its own without merging it with any other constituency, and that I will be the Chair of the Sengkang Town Council. 

In relation to the next critical steps for taking over, we wrote to both AMKTC and PRPTC on Saturday 11 July to request a preliminary meeting to discuss the handover. 

On Wednesday 15 July, we specifically requested for copies of the contracts for Managing Agent services and use of TC Management software to be provided to us as soon as possible.  PRPTC, whom we understand to be co-ordinating the handover with AMKTC, suggested a virtual meeting on Friday 16 July.

At the virtual meeting on 16 July, we repeated our request for copies of agreements for MA services and TC management software, and to arrange a physical meeting next week to further discuss the hand over and get a briefing on operational matters relating to both TCs.

Meanwhile, we understand that some Sengkang residents have been calling the Aljunied-Hougang TC to report estate matters. Please note that the jurisdiction to manage HDB estates still resides in the two current TCs: Anchorvale is still managed by AMKTC, and Punggol East and Sengkang Central by PRPTC. Please continue to report estate matters and make your S&CC payments to the existing TCs until further notice.

I will provide further updates on the progress of the takeover in the coming weeks. Thank you for your patience and faith in us.

Yours sincerely,

He Ting Ru 
on behalf of Sengkang MPs-elect"

How the WP won Sengkang, in marketing-speak:

1. Strong core messaging
The WP has consistently stuck to its refrain of ""we don't want to form the government, we just want to offer the checks and balances that are good for Singapore"". They refresh their slogan each election (""ownself check ownself"", ""co-driver to slap driver"", ""no blank cheque""), but the main message is constant, realistic, non-threatening and easy to understand. 

In contrast, much of the PAP's message is built on implicit threats (""we need a strong mandate to continue fighting Covid-19"", ""don't be taken in by false promises"", ""do you want to lose good ministers and Singapore's stable political standing and your jobs and home values and have our women become maids in other countries???""). It works as a scare tactic for a while, but the negativity can get tiring.

2. Audience segmentation
Audiences are not homogenous - what appeals to the older Teochew-speaking Hougang crowd may not resonate with English-educated young families in Sengkang. The WP clearly knows this, evidenced by the candidates they picked for each ward. Does the PAP also know this? Their Sengkang slate was all-male - younger on paper, to be sure, but offering no new perspectives for their target audience. If the PAP's idea of diversity is restricted to just throwing in one minority candidate in each GRC, they need to adjust their one-size-fits-all approach.

3. Staying updated with social trends
Much of the furore over Raeesah Khan's social media posts was dismissed by the PAP and its supporters as being ""imported Western values"" about ""race wokeness"" (my term, not theirs). But that runs the risk of dismissing the shared lived experiences of minority races in every single country around the world, including Singapore. And once you tap into repressed minority sentiment, it's not just limited to race. It extends to every feeling anyone has ever had of being discriminated against for an attribute out of their control (gender, age, body size, personality traits, etc). Young voters understood Raeesah's impulsiveness as much as her anger. They reacted with sympathy to her remorse, and with disappointment to the PAP's escalation of their attempted takedown.

4. Service recovery
Which brings us to the next point - when a mistake is made, perceived or otherwise, your audience wants an apology. Every customer service tome says this. By owning Raeesah's failings, apologising for them and standing with her, Pritam Singh set up a strong contrast against the PAP's treatment of the Ivan Lim incident. The fact that all these events were unscripted served to highlight the importance of shared core values. It's a cliche, but values are key to guide crisis decisions and reactions in a way that stays consistent with your overall brand.

5. Content marketing
There's a reason why the WP's candidate intro video went viral. ""Slick"" is as much a compliment as sour grapes. The video achieved that elusive quality of authenticity - the holy grail of marketing. Younger voters lapped it up. 

The PAP's comms efforts relied too much on their old playbook - character assassination, selective reading of literature, oddly poorly-worded press releases (one of which even drew a rebuke from Aware for casually referencing domestic violence, which is extremely out of touch). Time to change PR team?

6. Timing
The funny thing about this whole GE was how unprepared the PAP seemed, even though they were literally the only people who knew when the election would be held. No doubt they were distracted by the pandemic (then why hold it now?) and their own agenda of the 4G transition (also, why now?). By insisting on dictating the terms of the election timing, but then not delivering a well-prepared performance, the PAP disappointed on two counts.

One thing I would love to know is whether the WP deliberately steered the narrative towards East Coast while plotting all the while to grab Sengkang. Would that be giving it too much credit?"

Has WP convinced Sengkang voters to vote the whole team into parliament? I don't think they have done it yet. To be clear, odds are that they will send Jamus into parliament as NCMP,  but it is far less clear that his team will actually beat the PAP team.

He Tingru, one of the darlings from the last GE, has been surprisingly quiet this time round. Isn't she one of the stars as well? I've not seen any significant mention about her yet, whether in MSM, online media or even fan pages.   Remember she has a better chance of winning than Nicole Seah.

The credit analyst is so obscure that I can't even remember his name offhand. I read that he would use his professional expertise to hold the gov accountable on reserves and other financial issues. But I've yet to see him scrutinising these issues the way Jamus and his supporters have. 

As for Farid Khan's daughter, like Jamus she has a strong foreign accent but unlike Jamus she's too young to have his level of expertise. She keeps talking about social justice and she's ""Malay"" (I mean his dad got his race certified) but I've not heard her speak Malay or talk about issues affecting the community. I know other WP candidates have done so but they're running elsewhere.

Furthermore, having run Punggol East for some time and having 9 years of experience in AHTC, could they propose what they want to do (within their powers as non-PAP MPs) in terms of neighbourhood issues? Yes I know the estate manager/grassroots argument, but those deserve some attention esp since WP has actually managed a GRC.

The above are meant to be constructive criticism. I live far from SK so pls feel free to point out what I've missed on the ground. As I said, this is just armchair talk."

I remember there were two cats I named Poki and Sparta. Poki was this black and white cat who would make a weird sound when I scratched near the tail, and Sparta was this brown cat would always play swat me but only with his paws. They always remembered me everyday, like they would run to me when I called their name, but would run away when strangers approached. The thing is I never fed them once, they only wanted some pets and company

Now I live in sengkang and there are no cats. Can someone bring some cats over here to start a new generation of cats? Thanks."

So my friend asked me to research more on what the speeches of MPs from both sides and what they are bringing to the table. I almost choke when I read this article, I seriously thought it is some kind of joke. To be honest, what kind of calibre is this ? Is making the environment more green going to resolve the overcrowding issue in Sengkang ? Residents of Sengkang should really open your eyes and ears wide. 
Don’t just believe what I say, go read it for yourself.

Just want to ask if anyone of you have experienced inconsiderate students (Mostly from secondary school and polytechnic students), been coming into the room and started playing PC online games, chit chatting and at times laughing their ass off despite knowing that the room is meant to be used for study purposes. 
Got really annoyed and tried ""complain"" to the security guards but nothing has been done. 

Just wanna ask if anyone bother to do anything if you have encounter these kind of similar incidents, not only in this premises (e.g. libraries and study corner) 

Also like to bring out this issue, because i believed students who have been using ""study"" facilities are facing similar problems and I would like to ask for advice on how to handle these kind of situations, especially you are having your finals and the people around you just don't give a crap.
