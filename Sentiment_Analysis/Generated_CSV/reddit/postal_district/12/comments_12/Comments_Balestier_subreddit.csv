Nope, the British made promises to decolonize India in exchange for cannon fodder during WWII and I. Also USA pressure on the UK to decolonize after the war, and having its resources destroyed after fighting the Japanese and Germans (not Indians, btw). 

In the past, there have been huge armed revolts against British rule in India, but the British promptly destroyed them all. This wasn't possible after WWII due to inadequate resources for maintaining an empire. What's a Bose and a meek Gandhi gonna do, if the Japanese and Germans did not wage war with the Brits?

Yes, but unlike what you said, India contributed nothing towards weakening the British Empire. This was mainly done by the Germans and Japanese. On the other hand, I don't know what a bunch of peasants armed with sticks can do to British might. Or a bunch of pseudo- sannyasis like Gandhi.

> Fell through a hole in the floor

> The incident occurred on Nov. 14, 2019, at 360 Balestier Road, Shaw Plaza.

> According to a statement by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the 30-year-old Indian national, who has not been identified, fell through a partition board on the floor from level 1 floor to basement 1.

> Photos submitted by a Mothership reader showed a narrow hole in the side of a room, leading to what looks like a car park in the level below.

> Another photo showed the worker lying on the ground with a large pool of blood forming around his head.

> Two other workers appeared to be attending to the victim.

> A first-aid box was next to them.

> Advertisement

> The Singapore Civil Defence Force told Mothership that the worker was still alive when they arrived at the scene, and he was subsequently conveyed conscious to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

> Unfortunately, the worker succumbed to his injuries.

> The worker was employed by Express 21, a company specialising in mechanical and electrical services.

> According to their website, the company handles electrical engineering and structured cabling solutions for buildings as well.

> MOM stated that all work at the worksite has been stopped, and investigations are ongoing.

> A funeral was held for the migrant worker, though it is uncertain exactly when and where it was held.

284,12,e47f2gb,t3_97dmzr,"Combat Durian, a stall located next to the Goh Chor Tua Pek Kong Temple in Balestier, has been around for more than 50 years.

Photos of their customers, including local actors and radio DJs, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam and even Hong Kong actor Chow Yun Fat, are plastered all over the walls at the stall at 249 Balestier Road.

""There are too many to put up all,"" said Mr Ang Seck Puan, 78.

He is known to durian-lovers for coining catchy durian names - Sultan Durian after D24, and King Of Kings or Wang Zhong Wang after the highest-quality Mao Shan Wang durians from Gua Musang, a town in Malaysia. Among major durian suppliers in Malaysia, he has earned a reputation for being extremely picky.

He told The Straits Times in Mandarin: ""If they give us bad-quality ones, I'll tell them not to come the next day.

""I'm very strict about quality, and that's how we ensure three generations of customers keep coming back.""

He started out selling vegetables in 1957 when he was 17, but decided to sell mainly durians in 1965.He said they were cheap then. ""One durian used to be about 50 cents.""

Now, many customers pick the Mao Shan Wang durian as their favourite, for its rich, creamy taste and intense aroma.

During the peak durian season around June, it would cost about $15 per kg, down from $25 per kg usually.

Because of the reduced price, the stall would see snaking queues. Mr Ang carries laminated photos of such scenes in his wallet.

In order to secure the best-quality durians when he first started, he had to travel to Malaysia every day to find suitable suppliers and build good relationships.

""I had to rent a small lorry and drive to Muar in Johor every night to see the supplier's durian farms and choose the best-quality durians,"" he said.

He would leave Singapore around 10pm to be among the first to hand-pick the thorny fruit at 6am.

""I wanted to be able to choose, instead of taking the leftovers, the bad-quality ones. The durians need to have a good smell, and a hearty bitter taste, yet still buttery and sweet. That's what I like, what our customers like,"" he said.

His daughter, Madam Linda Ang, 52, still samples durians from every batch they get from their suppliers. She took over the running of the stall seven years ago.

But Mr Ang still turns up almost every day. The stall opens at noon, and closing times can range from 10pm to midnight.

By word of mouth, the stall's reputation grew.Customers flocked to the stall from Indonesia, China, Hong Kong, Korea, and even the United States and Europe, armed with bags to pack boxes of vacuum-sealed durian in cooler bags. The stall gives the bags for free.

The vacuum seal hides the strong smell, said Madam Ang, eliminating the need for the fruit to be wrapped in newspapers and coffee powder, like most stalls do. She introduced the idea seven years ago.

Mr Ang added that some foreign customers would buy up to 20 boxes, with each box holding around 1.8kg of durian flesh from around 6kg of durians. Each box cost between $150 and $200.

Mr Ang said he dropped out of primary school when he was 12, to support his 14 younger siblings.

His father, who worked in a newspaper printing company, made about $300 a month, which was hardly enough to support the 15 of them through school.

""I left school to help him in the newspaper company. That's why I don't know how to speak well.""

As proof of that, he said Combat Durian got its name as it was how he pronounced ""come back"".

Said a customer who wanted to be known only as Madam Tan, 70, a housewife: ""I have been coming here for 31 years, and they never disappoint.""

Pointing to the four boxes she bought, she said: ""I always buy the Mao Shan Wang - it has the bitterness and creaminess that I like, that I can't find anywhere else.""",t3_97dmzr,15-08-2018
