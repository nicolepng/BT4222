To add to that, class discrimination in Bangladesh is very severe and he would have to be very lucky to even break into a lower middle class job.

Like other developing countries,  there is extreme inequality in Bangladesh. On the one hand, you have this Bangladeshi dude who gave up university to be a cleaner in Singapore, while on the other hand, the 34th richest guy in Singapore is also from Bangladesh.

But based on the temperature readings published at NEA's webpage, it turns out that NEA's thermometer at Admiralty climate station indeed showed a sharp dip to 22.9°C at around 8 am, rising to 27.6°C at around 11 am, followed by a sudden plunge to 21.6°C at around 12 pm on 01 Jul 2018.  

Were those perhaps glitches ? For instance, I notice that PUB's water-level sensors may sometimes go from, say, 2.5 m to 0.0 m, & then back to 2.5 m within 5 minutes, even though the canal(s) in question held lots of water all that while.

Incidentally, NEA has just released the [monthly weather review for June 2018](http://www.weather.gov.sg/weather-fortnightly-outlook):

> The daily temperature in June 2018 ranged between 21.5°C and 35.0°C.  

Well, it appears that Mothership (& everyone else) had somehow overlooked that mystery June 2018 day when the local temperature apparently fell to 21.5°C -- ie. a grand 0.1°C colder than Mothership's 01 July ""winter"" noon. (And nope, NEA's review doesn't indicate when that June event occurred.)  

Below is ST's dutiful report about the said June day, which was perhaps ""chillest"" only in hindsight (02 Jul 2018):  
> https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/weather-to-be-less-wet-for-first-half-of-july-but-showers-to-persist  
> The lowest temperature for June was 21.5 deg C, among the chilliest in history. The lowest temperature on record is 21.2 deg C, in January 1934.  

UPDATE (03 Jul 2018, 12.10 am SGT):  
ST had edited the concluding part of the aforementioned article, which now provides more info regarding the recent 21.5°C temperature record. No mention of time though:  
> An MSS spokesman said that the chilliest daily minimum temperature for last month - 21.5 deg C - was recorded on June 15 at Sembawang.  
> The record low for June is 20 deg C, recorded on June 25, 2013 at Tengah.  

Meanwhile, as of now, there's no change to the Jun 2018 weather review at NEA's website.

Thanks for info about the rainfall data. That explains why the temperature at Admiralty climate station declined rapidly between 11 am & 12 pm.  

For some reason, NEA's rainfall graph is blank for all locations in my browser -- probably something is blocking the rendering. And I was conked out from 11.20 am till 7 pm on 01 Jul 2018 Sunday, so I have no idea if it was raining during that period.  

Unfortunately, even though I had the fan blowing at me from just 2 metres away while I zzz'ed, it didn't feel cool at all at my location. Whatever transient coolness that might have descended with possible rain was probably tempered by a good dose of urban-industrial heat island effect here.  

Aside from that, the rain was likely quite widespread because there was a dip of ~5°C across Singapore mostly between 11 am & 1 pm on 01 Jul 2018 -- as based on a [temperature sampling of 6 locations](https://i.imgur.com/fPrFXIb.png) (collated from NEA's temperature graphs).",t3_8vgtjx,02-07-2018

> SINGAPORE - Another 12 residents and two staff at a welfare home in Admiralty have tested positive for the Covid-19 infection, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said on Monday (April 27).

> The residents and staff of Acacia Home are now warded at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, said the ministries in a joint statement.

> The 15 residents and staff were tested for the virus on Sunday, after a 62-year-old resident of Acacia Home tested positive on Saturday night.

> As a precautionary measure, a total of 167 people including 115 residents, 31 staff and 21 contractors who have been to the home to carry out essential work in the past four weeks were tested for the virus.

> Apart from the 15 who tested positive, the remaining 153 tested negative. Contract tracing is ongoing, said MOH and MSF.

> Acacia Home is a welfare home for destitute persons, and is managed by Sathya Sai Social Service and funded by MSF.

> All the staff and residents of the home have been placed on quarantine. Residents will be quarantined in the Home and Sathya Sai Social Service will deploy staff from other facilities to ensure the Home continues operations as necessary.

> The home has also been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected promptly, said MOH and MSF.

> MSF said its immediate priority is to support the home, their staff and the residents.

> ""To safeguard their health and well-being, all staff are now required to use full personal protection equipment. All residents must now always wear a surgical mask. Since 25 April 2020, Acacia Home has stopped taking in new residents for the time being,"" the ministry added.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> MSF said it is monitoring the situation closely and will be stepping up checks.

> It also reminded all homes to abide by the precautionary measures in the ministry's advisories.

> ""Residential and community-based facilities are reminded to be vigilant when conducting health checks on staff and residents, and to observe high standards of personal and environmental hygiene,"" the statement said.

> ""This includes keeping the facility's environment clean, and frequent washing of hands with soap - especially before the preparation and consumption of meals, after toilet visits or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing.""
