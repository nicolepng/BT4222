Evacuate everyone quickly, then you only have to worry about fire spreading to adjacent objects. Trying to extinguish the fire while there are people trapped inside only works if the fire is really small, because there is a chance you may end up pushing debris or the fire into the person.

In the scenario where every door is stuck shut, then yes definitely try to extinguish the fire ASAP before things get worse, because without any hydraulic tools it's quite unlikely you will be able to get the door open.",t3_it3749,15-09-2020

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî A 50-year-old man was sentenced to three months‚Äô jail on Thursday (Aug 15), after pleading guilty to stealing a basin tap from a bathroom at the police division headquarters in Woodlands.

> Seah Kian Li committed the offence on March 1 this year, but the police station‚Äôs cleaning supervisor only discovered the tap was missing about a month later.

> The court heard that Seah was at the station that evening to make bail for his brother.

> While he was using the toilet on the third storey, he noticed that the basin tap was loose and realised it would be suitable for use with the toilet basin in his own home.

> He then unscrewed the tap ‚Äî valued at S$171.20 ‚Äî from the sink with his bare hands and took it home with him.

> On March 28, while the cleaning supervisor was making her rounds, she noticed the tap was missing and reported it to the station‚Äôs facility manager. When contractors told the manager that they had not taken the tap, they informed the divisional logistics officer, Mr Lee Giem Chong, of the matter.

> From closed-circuit television footage, Mr Lee saw Seah unscrewing and taking the tap. After pinning down his identity through further investigations, Mr Lee made a police report at the Woodlands West Neighbourhood Police Centre on April 16.

> Seah‚Äôs home was raided that same day. Authorities then discovered that the basin tap was affixed to his home toilet basin.

> The tap was seized and Seah was subsequently arrested.

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Foo Shi Hao told the court that Seah has a string of previous offences, dating back to 1996 when he was convicted of property-related offences.¬†

> He was also dealt with in 2002 on drug-related charges, housebreaking by night in 2006, and driving while intoxicated in 2008.

> Seah gave his own mitigation plea through a Chinese interpreter. He pleaded for a light sentence, saying he has been looking after his unemployed younger brother since their mother passed away.

> In response, the prosecutor said there was ‚Äúnothing exceptional‚Äù about the plea. He added that he would leave it to the police to make a disposal order.

> For his charge of vandalism, Seah could have been jailed for up to three years or fined up to S$2,000.

> SINGAPORE - On the first day of Chinese New Year, a group of Malay volunteers in Woodlands gathered to bring festive cheer, distributing goodie bags to elderly Chinese who live¬†alone in rental flats and organising a ""makan"" session for about 300 residents.

> Sembawang GRC MP Amrin Amin shared photos of the event at Block 802, Woodlands Street 81, in a Facebook post on Sunday (Feb 18).

> About 25 Malay volunteers who live in Woodlands turned up to help organise the session, which was attended by residents of all races and ages, Mr Amrin told The Straits Times on Tuesday (Feb 20).

> They were joined by about 50 motorcyclists from four biker groups, who helped to distribute packs of food such as chicken rice and beehoon to 100 homes.

> The recipients were mainly elderly Chinese who live alone, as well as those who are less mobile, although the volunteers¬†gave out food to Indians and Malays too.

> Mr Amrin had met some of the leaders of the biker groups while on his house visits, and invited them to participate in the charity event, which they did so heartily, he said.

> This was the second time such an event was organised on the first day of Chinese New Year for the Woodlands residents, Mr Amrin said.

> However, it was the first time the bikers got involved with the distribution of food. It was also the first time volunteers helped spring clean the homes of some elderly residents.

> About 30 volunteers spruced up the windows, toilets and living areas of eight homes on the Sunday leading up to Chinese New Year.

> ""We started on a small scale with eight houses, all from rental blocks in Woodlands,"" said Mr Amrin. The work was done by Malay volunteers, which he had requested for as he did not want to disturb Chinese volunteers who were preparing for or celebrating Chinese New Year.

> Joining in the festivities were 16 men from a local van drivers club¬†called Abam Abam Van Singapura, along with some of their wives.

> The club¬†said on Facebook that the event was a blessing ""as we got to know more people who shared the same passion that we have in the name of charity"".

> Project engineer Khairil Anuar, 32, the leader of ¬†Abam Abam Van Singapura, told ST that the event went well.

> ""It was a good charity event. I feel good doing it as I am also residing in Woodlands,"" he said.

> Mr Muhamad Faiz, 30, who helped organise the events as co-chairman of Woodlands&apos;¬†Malay Activities Executive Committee, said the residents really enjoyed the makan session.

> ""I believe that¬† food is a great tool to bond people together. And having Mr Amrin prepare the prata, it&apos;s a special¬†treat for them,"" he said. ""Those staying alone shouldn&apos;t be left out during this¬†joyous occasion. We&apos;ll probably do it again next year,¬†it&apos;ll probably be bigger next year.""

> Mr Amrin told ST that sharing food is a good practice that he hopes to encourage, and one that he has grown up with.

> ""I think most of us grew up in that environment where during the festive season we exchanged goodies,"" he said.

> ""I&apos;m very heartened by the response, in particular by different groups of people coming together. This is what we&apos;ve talked about - the kampung spirit. When our Chinese friends are busy celebrating Chinese New Year, another group can come in to help and spread the cheer.""

> Mr Amrin said Mr Ong Lai Seng, one of the residents who was at the makan session¬†and whose flat was cleaned by volunteers, told him: ""Here, everyone is good, Malay, Chinese, Indian all good.""

> He said it was a ""demonstration of good neighbourliness, of racial and religious harmony, a compassionate society taking care of the elderly and the needy"".

> ""It&apos;s a mass effort. It showcased the best of what we want to do,"" he said. ""Now that&apos;s the Singapore spirit,"" he wrote in his Facebook post.

> The court heard that the boy had just finished his classes and was walking home along with his father, Mr Wu Zhiqiang, 35, and his friend Mr Ma Guofeng, 34.¬†

> The three of them saw Du and his wife approaching them on an e-scooter and kept to the left side of the pathway to let the e-scooter through.¬†

> As Du rode nearer to the trio, he stepped on his accelerator and sped up.¬†

The scenario for scolding the kid for doing so and pulling out his fists is unethical, but that is a whole other topic, the man got into trouble with court for driving into the kid, not shouting at him and confronting the father.

And for people who are annoyed at e-scooters and other e-vehicles, why do you have to be so uptight? The world is evolving technology wise, it is not a matter of the e-vehicles fault, but the person driving them and the people around them who need to be more aware of their surroundings and not take risks.

Just take reckless drivers for example - they lose their license for a certain period of time once their offence crosses a certain threshold of harm.

1032,25,dwu5vmk,t1_dwu3y0t,"Yeah well, if it's going to impact their ""luxury"" fund, I'm not sure it's really that detrimental to their livelihood in the first place. Anyway, I rest my case. Fines are almost always unequal when it comes to punishing the rich and the poor. ",t3_89ph8m,05-04-2018
1033,25,dwu8sgp,t1_dwu5vmk,"Fines are not meant to be detrimental to your livelihood though, they just impose a cost on you that is hopefully ""painful"" enough to stop you from doing it.

If you're talking about things like jaywalking or littering, then yes, fines are unequal - but if they are calibrated according to income, and for offences involving mostly the middle- and upper-class (like cars), they can go a long way. ",t3_89ph8m,05-04-2018
1034,25,dwu9nvn,t1_dwu8sgp,"Since when are cars mostly exclusive to middle-class and up? Even in Singapore, many people work as taxi drivers and private hire drivers who drive and don't own cars. Our middle class is also actually very wide. There is a huge difference between lower middle and upper middle class, let alone the upper class. The fact that someone owns a Cherry QQ doesn't make him the same class as a BMW owner. My point is that even in cases like speeding that involve cars, there is a wide range of people affected, and they are going to span across different socioeconomic classes. Therefore, financial penalties, on their own, are discriminatory because some people are just going to be more readily able to pay them off, which means they are unequally punished vis-a-vis the others. The amount that would be ""painful"" is so arbitrary in this case, because it varies so much according to each individual's income, but more importantly, liabilities. I'm sure fines will go a long way to deter those with tight finances from committing certain crimes, but there are going to be people who just wouldn't feel the pinch as much. Which is why fines are unequal. ",t3_89ph8m,05-04-2018
1035,25,dwucqu0,t1_dwu9nvn,"An income-based fine works based on marginal utility,and  makes the punishment roughly equal across different SES - for example, 3% of your monthly income, which is about one day's work. This works whether or not you are lower middle, upper middle, or upper class. 

You said that income based fines still penalise the poor - and I said that for cars in particular, they work because personal cars are not a necessity in Singapore, hence anyone who buys one has spare cash. Even someone with a Cheryl QQ has the financial means to pay >$50,000 for it, instead of taking public transport. 

You also mention that different people have different liabilities. I don't see how this changes the equation. If you take on too much debt, that's on you for poor financial planning. 

You brought up a valid point on taxi and Uber drivers - and I agree, they may not be as well off as personal car owners. I don't have the answer for this, but I would still say that income-based fines are still more equal than the current traffic fines we have, which are a pittance for the upper class. 

If you want examples of how it's done overseas, you can look at countries like the UK, Finland and Sweden, all of which have income-based fines. 

In case you misunderstood me - I'm not saying we should replace ALL jail terms with fines. If you murder someone, you deserve to be locked up for the rest of your life. But for some minor offences, locking someone up is counter productive. Firstly, locking someone up costs a LOT for the State. And secondly, a stay in prison can ruin someone's life - the prison environment is not an accurate reflection of life outside, and some people have trouble reintegrating into society after a prison stint. In cases where the offence is not heinous, an income-based fine serves as a good punishment that is more equal than the fines we have today. ",t3_89ph8m,05-04-2018

> One person, Tan, who was part of the group who encountered the remains, spoke to the Chinese daily.

> He said they also found bones and fur that had been peeled off the dogs tied up in plastic bags and hung on some of the trees in the area.

> The 52-year-old real estate agent shared that he would often feed the stray dogs in the vicinity of Senoko Fishery Port on his way home, but started noticing something strange sometime in late February this year.

> ""The stray dogs normally aren't afraid when someone is feeding them. However, I noticed that whenever I got close, they will start running away, or hide in a corner,"" Tan shared his observation.

> ‚ÄúThey would only come out to eat the food after the person puts the food down and leave them behind.""

> After sharing his observations with other dog lovers, he came to learn that some of the stray dogs were injured, while some had broken legs.

> Most simply thought they had been hit by a large vehicle.

> Witness suspected stray dogs being slaughtered for sale

> However, Tan suspected that the stray dogs were being abused by people, and decided to visit the forest in Woodlands to check the place out.

> Tan told the Chinese daily that none of them had expected to find what they saw.

> ""We saw the carcasses of the dogs thrown inside white gunny sacks, and there were plastic bags hanging off trees, with dog bones and dog fur found inside the bags.""

> Tan immediately took photos and videos of the scene to collect evidence, and the group later went down to the police station in Woodlands to notify authorities of the incident.

> According to Tan, the stray dogs could have been slaughtered for sale, rather than abuse, mentioning that dog abusers would normally kill and bury the dog, and not go to the extent of plucking off their fur.

> Tan also shared that many of the injured stray dogs have injuries that look like a bloody hole on their bodies, such as their heads or limbs.

> Suspicious man hanging around forested area in Woodlands

> As their suspicions grew, Tan shared that he and other dog lovers started keeping watch around the vicinity of the forested area, and observed a middle-aged man who would drive a lorry into the area about three days a week.

> ""He would walk into the forest with a stick-like object in his hand, and his lorry would hold a lot of gunny sacks as well. He seemed very suspicious,"" he told the Chinese daily.

> Tan said that the group tried to question the man before, but he was very hostile and aggressive towards them.

> ""I'm here to teach the dogs, if they're not obedient I'll beat them,"" the man said to them, according to Tan.

> Tan also engaged a private investigator to help install hidden cameras on the trees, in hope to collect evidence. However, the camera was found by the other party, and was knocked down with a club.

> He tried again by installing a wireless camera under the tree, but it was found and destroyed again by the other party before he could capture a photo of the man.

> Unable to help rescue dogs due to Covid-19 restrictions

> After the incident, Tan and the other dog lovers reached out to more people for help.

> On one occasion, a person happened to check the area out and found stray dogs locked up inside cages, and quickly rescued them while nobody was around.

> Due to Covid-19 restrictions, Tan said that they are no longer able to help rescue the stray dogs, and hoped that the relevant authorities are able to save the dogs and get to the bottom of the case.

> Mothership has contacted SPCA for more information regarding the incident.

Frogs are a part of an ecosystem, just not this one and depending on the type of frog. Some frogs are an invasive species and need to be killed.

> Anything with a heart beat is a life. 

True that animals with a heart beat is alive but we don't value all animals equally. We keep cows in cages for their meat even when they are the least efficient to convert feed to meat. We shoot crows and pigeons when they over populate an area. We keep birds in cages for their beauty when they are born to fly. We force inseminate cows with bull semen to get the perfect cow breed.

And of course humans are also a biological animal. And we have a different set of rules in regards to human. So to say anything with a heart beat is alive is technically true but all heart beats are equal is definitely false.

Agree to Disagree is primarily used when a discussion cannot continue due to insufficient evidence at this point in time or as a matter that is purely subjective. Eg: ""I believe Heavy Metal is superior to Classical music.""

It also concludes the opponent's position on the subject matter is equivalent to yours.

However, it is not the case here. 

Your statement is ""This is equally as bad as the teenagers killing the frogs."", in reference to the killing of the stray dogs.

I proposed that this is not so as humans has a closer interspecies bond with dogs from our ancestral history. You counter with a statement that both are living animals, insinuating you simply need to be alive to attain equal status. I counter with factual statements that we do not, in-fact, value all life-forms as equal through out varying treatment of other species, proving in-fact, they are not equal.

Though I don't carry this out IRL because IRL ""Dishonest Harmony has more personal value than Honest Conflict."" especially in Singapore. IRL I would have just nodded along and agree with a person's opinion, even if it's wrong or hypocritical, because that is what people what to hear.

I find this story so fascinating because this is probably the first case of ""Frog abuse"" I have ever seen. I've even tried to put in ""Frog abuse investigation"" in the google machine and only found 1 case of a deputy in USA tasing a frog while on duty and he was later fired for misuse of police equipment, not frog abuse.

Frogs have always been very low on the totem pole of valuable animals so the sudden interest in frog abuse is.... strange.

I have several hypothesis on this.

1. Known bad actor. Because the actor is known for a previous crime, any small subsequent actions are magnified. He'd probably hit by the internet mob too if he was found to have not flush a public toilet after use.
2. Shocked at first time seeing cruelty. Most people are sheltered, never seeing a cow being slaughtered, male chicks being crushed seconds after being hatched, or animals being raised to be live bait. Not the first time for me as I've seen frogs being hooked alive to catch fish RECREATIONALLY, not catching fish for survival.
3. Knee Jerk reaction. In isolation, yea, this is very fucked up, but on a larger scale (these frogs are bread to die being fish food in the end), I feel don't really deserve so much attention. 
4. Genuine shift in morality. We are moving more and more towards Veganism. In fact, Vegan stance on this would be the most consistent to their personal values so they have my respects.

It would be interesting to see how this case would turn out. I suspect the case would be either :-

1. Thrown out
2. Isolated case where this person would be the only person in Singapore to ever be convicted of Frog abuse
3. There will be a shift in culture where abuse of frogs are legally punishable, meaning recreational fishing using live frog bait would be banned as well",t3_klpwv4,29-12-2020

1185,25,gnhk95w,t3_ljw2yf,"I‚Äôm going to make an unpopular opinion: the Dover forest issue is more bandwagoning than actual concern over the forest.

Look at the first post on r/sg about Dover, it got 900+ upvotes, indicating plenty of interest. It spawned 3 posts about the forest/suggesting alternatives, and 7 posts overall on Dover.

In contrast, Tengah got a miserable 2 posts on its forest. Clementi got 3 about the forest, and that‚Äôs all. Can‚Äôt find anything else.

The first post on the ecological value of Tengah only got 60 votes, 2 years ago. The petition to save Clementi forest, the oldest post I could find on the topic had only a miserable 130 votes (which is about the same for *all* Clementi forest posts), no where near that of Dover.

Looking at the number of upvotes here, it looks similar to the subsequent posts regarding Dover, basically the ‚Äúdiehards‚Äù. Perhaps more interest than the residual Dover posts, given that it is still early. But, overall, little interest appears to be gathered on this tragedy at Kranji, despite the *outpouring* of public support for Dover.

Bandwagoning isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. When channelled to good causes, it can be a force of good. The problem is people being led to do more harm than good, asking for preservation of one less significant forest without regards to opportunity costs and how it might threaten other more important ones. 

Many arguments I had over Dover appeared to be very dogmatic. Dogmatic arguments such as apparently Dover is the last home to many endangered wildlife (probably something they got from that Mothership post), and challenging that illogical point resulted only in massive downvoting. Come on, a forest reclaimed by nature in the last 50 years is going to house a dozen endangered species that you can‚Äôt find in the nearby Clementi or Bukit Timah nature areas? Where the hell did those wildlife migrate from in the first place? From thin air?

It‚Äôs always heartening to see people care about nature. But one must always be aware of bandwagoning. All forests are important, maybe the primary forest are more so, as they are the original home to our wildlife, especially the endangered ones. 

To wildlife, Tengah, Clementi, Dover, Simpang, Ubin, Tekong, and so on, are more or less the same. Reducing the area of forest reduces habitat for wildlife, no matter its location. We can‚Äôt build multi-story forest, but we can build densely utilised building that minimises the land footprint. Bandwagoning misses the forest for a tree. Bandwagoning is not interested in discussion on a topic unless it agrees with the popular view. Popular view may not always be right, they can always be co-opted by people with other agenda.

So, when we look at forest, let us view it in a way to maximise the preservation of wildlife. If we can‚Äôt don‚Äôt cut, don‚Äôt. If we have to cut, we want to cut the least. If we truly care about the forest, all of them are important, be it Dover or in Lim Chu Kang.

It would be better for the environment if our efforts are genuine. We care about the environment because we care, not because its popular to care.

And that said, Kranji forest is being enroached. Look at Google Map and you will find that Clementi forest is being cut into two for a canal right now. These are all environmental tragedies that we cannot ignore. These are situations where awareness is needed the most and yet often missing. If anything, the public apathy on those other forests are a worse tragedy than the destruction of those forest itself, especially when people are ‚Äúself-professed environmentalists‚Äù for that popular forest.",t3_ljw2yf,15-02-2021

To put it bluntly - to the trees and animals of any particular forest, the motivations behind conservation are fairly irrelevant. What matters is whether the forest is conserved, or cleared. Trees and animals are not bothered if the conservation was achieved on the basis of genuine concern, or bandwagoning.

On a wider scale as well, whether people support things like emission reductions because they genuinely believe in a principle of conserving the environment, or whether they support the same because it's the next cool thing on instagram, matters little to the climate and/or communities who are at greatest risk of climate change related disasters such as low lying sea side cities. 

The concern about bandwagoning also seems to ignore the reality of society today - bandwagoning is rampant on just about every issue (on both sides of the issue). Hypothesizing a movement entirely untouched by bandwagoning is unrealistic. Movements should account for, and actively take advantage of bandwagoning because that's a great way to get wide support. Getting people to have genuine concerns is a nice *bonus* to have, but if we require movements to only proceed on the basis of genuine concern, then that movement is never going to take off. 

Contextualizing the above back in the Dover Forest issue, if people don't care as much about other forests, the question we should be asking is how do we get people to care (bandwagoning or otherwise) about these other forests, and how we can expand on the existing care and awareness over Dover to the other forests.

That‚Äôs where the opportunity costs come in. If we cannot preserve all the forests, then it‚Äôs important to evaluate the opportunity costs. It is very unlikely that we can preserve all the forests we have left with right now.

If we blindly support one forest over others without regard for its opportunity cost, ie, jumping on the bandwagon, we might end up causing more harm than good to nature. We can pack 3x more people in Dover than Tengah on a plot of the same area, to preserve Dover would imply we need to clear 3x more land, *if* we have no choice but to develop land.

Right now, because the government and HDB has no clear stance against cutting more forest, it is very reasonable to assume that preserving Dover may come at the expense of other forests. In the short to intermediate term, it is highly unlikely people can force HDB to stop developing forested areas. If people tunnel vision on Dover, we might end up missing the forest for the trees.

We can‚Äôt run before we learn how to walk. We can‚Äôt talk about saving *all* the forest when we can‚Äôt even petition the government to save one. If right now, our options are limited and we could only petition to save one, then, that one forest being saved should be the best option, which I don‚Äôt honestly think Dover is. If we jump on the Dover bandwagon, we risk harming a larger amount of forested area, which probably is more harmful to the wildlife, since it represents a greater loss of habitat.

That is the point I am making about the danger of bandwagoning. I already acknowledge that bandwagoning can be good sometimes, and like you said, the wildlife doesn‚Äôt care if the concern for them is genuine or fake. 

The problem with bandwagoning is that it is ultimately the act of blindly following what is popular, and the popular view may or may not be the best option out there. It can lead to a situation where people fixate on a poorer option while ignoring other potentially better options.

If we look at the costs and opportunity costs, I really don‚Äôt think Dover is the *best* option we have.

If anything, Chek Jawa is probably a top tier nature sanctuary, something Dover is nowhere close to in significance. And that person even tried to vehemently defend that.

It is *more than clear* that the government needs land to build housing. It is *more than clear* with affordable housing being something the government always tout as its ‚Äútrack record‚Äù. It is also *more than clear* that the government can zone forested areas for housing, which the Dover case clearly indicate.

Thus, it is no exercise in speculation to say that if Dover is preserved, other forest areas might be at risk. Given what has been done, it is only reasonable to presume that it will be done in the future. If we are to stop the government from clearing one plot, it is more than logical to assume they will simply find another plot.

We know the government do not build excessive housing anymore, and it is more reflective of supply and demand. If we allow Dover to meet this demand, and given that the high density of housing that can be packed on Dover, we buy ourselves a delay in destruction of other forests. 

If we deny using Dover to meet the demand, we hasten the prospect of other forest land being used to meet this demand. Given that Dover represents a very efficient utilisation of land, given the density of housing that can be built there, it‚Äôs preservation will only increase the risk of other forested plots of larger area being cleared.

If we can delay the destruction of forest to build relatively inefficient lower density housing, we buy ourselves time to rethink the question of conservation and land use, which obviously takes time.

Right now, it isn‚Äôt really a question of *if*, it is a question of *when*. That‚Äôs of course lamentable, but if you are the government, there‚Äôs really a lot of things to balance and pressures on land use.

Although by saving Dover, people can feel like they do something, it does not mean that it‚Äôs failure would result in a total loss. It‚Äôs loss will probably delay other patches being placed on the chopping board so quickly (because it satisfies a certain amount of demand). Looking at other forested areas, we know few of them could come close to Dover in terms of housing density, and we risk losing larger areas of wildlife habitats.

Petitioning to save Dover only makes the most sense if the government is unreasonably bulldosing large amount of forest to build ghost towns, as in that case, the government is a lost cause and we have to save what we can. Right now, we could probably trust HDB to be reasonable enough to destroy more or less what is needed, and thus it‚Äôs a matter of supply to meet demand.

The long term goal is conservation of all existing forest. The short term goal is to minimise ecological harm from land development. We want to save as many forest as possible. But, ask yourself, can we hope to achieve a total stop to forest destruction within the next 5-10 years? It‚Äôs difficult because of the apathy.

Edit: on apathy, my whole initial ‚Äúunpopular opinion‚Äù was on bandwagoning. That people only cared because it is popular, that people talked about conserving Dover because its the talked about topic, while at the same time disregarding other forests. When the Dover forest development first break the news, we got over 900 votes. In contrast, OP is now putting the destruction of Kranji forest on the radar, and it‚Äôs interest is fractional. We can‚Äôt talk about forcing the government to change its stance when people are still this apathetic. We are on reddit, the progressive echo chamber. One must imagine how much worse it would be outside of reddit.

Edit 2: make it clear, I want to point out the need for efficient land use. Why build 10-story blocks that needs more land to house as many people? Let‚Äôs build 40-50 stories high HDB. HDB needs to work with LTA/MOT more than before and come up with a multi-ministry development plans, with good infrastructure to support dense housing. Tengah is on the right track, but the west is being bottlenecked so there‚Äôs so much you can pack there. Also, HDB should work with CAAS on that height restriction thing, to maximise areas that can support huge tall HDBs. With dense housing, we will need less land, and less pressure to demolish forests.",t3_ljw2yf,15-02-2021
1232,25,gnhxva6,t1_gnhxg35,What argument? You‚Äôre just bandwagoning /s,t3_ljw2yf,15-02-2021
1233,25,gniosjm,t1_gnihc5x,"yea, i agree that it's definitely going to take *a lot* of manpower for the intervention. we still have a long way to go in raising the awareness and education needed to get people to even think about helping out. just pointing out that it's not all that accurate to say the forests will never undergo succession coz if given a chance, they can.",t3_ljw2yf,15-02-2021
1234,25,gni6k2g,t1_gni1zkj,"1. Your three ""*more than clear""* points merely establishes the historical trend of the Government to prioritize affordable housing over conservation of forests. It tells us nothing about the effect of conserving Dover. Indeed, if the historical trend holds true, the Government is simply going to cut down Dover as well as the other forests.

1A) In fact, if we approached this from a planning perspective, all the other forests already marked for housing or other planning purposes are *already at risk* and this would not change whatever the outcome at Dover, unless the planning designation changes (which requires events and societal pressure independent of what happens at Dover).

2) New housing is not a zero sum exchange between clearing forests and new housing developments. That's a false dichotomy which people that are seeking to conserve Dover are going to expressly reject. No one is saying ""don't clear this forest clear *that other one*"". Instead people are coming up with various ideas (of varying merit) about how other areas can be repurposed or intensified.

3) We've currently cleared a large majority of forests in Singapore (90%? Edit - sadly I have to correct this figure to 99% - [https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/research/publications/gardens-bulletin-singapore/-/media/sbg/gardens-bulletin/gbs\_63\_01,-a-,02\_y2011\_v63\_01,-a-,02/63\_01,-a-,02\_205\_y2011\_v63p1,-a-,p2\_gbs\_pg\_205.pdf](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/research/publications/gardens-bulletin-singapore/-/media/sbg/gardens-bulletin/gbs_63_01,-a-,02_y2011_v63_01,-a-,02/63_01,-a-,02_205_y2011_v63p1,-a-,p2_gbs_pg_205.pdf)) and are in the middle of an era of climate change that is scheduled to create all sorts of immediate problems including rising sea levels. The Government has also explicitly gone out on a limb to set up a Green Plan and other climate change incentives. Given this context, I am not sure why we need to wait for the Government to embark on building ghost towns. The Government has recognized the wider environmental issues and on that basis there is plenty of basis for people to petition for *all* remaining forests to be saved, including Dover.

The above can really be rephrased as a question - what benefits do we get by not petitioning for the preservation of Dover versus what benefits we get for petitioning for Dover *and getting the same people involved in petitioning for other forests as well*? Unless I am missing something, doing nothing ensures the status quo of apathy and forest clearing. Petitioning on the other hand, even if unsuccessful, provides chances for better outcomes (Dover is preserved, the other forests are preserved, both are preserved, and/or increased grassroots support for environmental issues).

Bandwagoning is not apathy. An truly apathetic populace would ironically be highly immune to bandwagoning. In this context, bandwagoning is actually a positive development - it shows that people can care, even if it is merely on a superficial level.",t3_ljw2yf,15-02-2021
1235,25,gni7dbr,t1_gni6k2g,"I want to say that I agree with you that petitioning of Dover raise awareness of threats to wildlife habitat. That isn‚Äôt in doubt.

One could hope Dover could drive people to rethink the status quo on conversation, and indeed, the Dover issue had spawned so many follow up posts on forests. Sadly, I don‚Äôt think the interest remains and what interest was gathered for Dover mostly remained only for Dover.

There‚Äôs no point arguing about the merits of demolishing Dover or preserving it. We both have different views and let‚Äôs agree to disagree. That being said, it‚Äôs a good thing a forest is preserved. While in my opinion it isn‚Äôt the best, some interest is better than none, I guess?

Maybe the strengths of Dover doesn‚Äôt really lie in its ecological value, but lies in the psychological value. Perhaps Dover will rally interest and save forests in the long term, even if the worse case scenario happens and the government simply find another forested plot to demolish in the short run.",t3_ljw2yf,15-02-2021
1236,25,gni9mba,t1_gni7dbr,"The Dover issue has spawned, just for example, this thread where people are talking about a patch of forest in Kranji which probably did not even exist for some people yesterday. The interest is modest compared to Dover, but this thread in likelihood would not even be here if Dover was not a popular topic of discussion.

Indeed, if the Dover petition results in comments like ""*hang on there are all these other forests that are at risk*"", then all the better. Dover itself is simply a continuation of a growing trend of environmental issues being raised more often and publicly. We can fit Dover in the same line of growth with other events like the cross island line environmental debate, the wildlife connectors over the express ways, the new Green Plan from the government, and so on.

In fact, I could raise your Dover with what is perhaps an even *more* bandwagony example. Otters have gone from basically being non-existent (or viewed as pests) to a sort of national icon in large part due to social media and looking cute. People at large don't exactly support the otters out of proper environmental concerns, but more so because they look cute on instagram and also because they live far away enough from the otter grounds and so don't have to deal with otters occasionally coming in to wipe out their private fishing pools.

As vapid as one might consider the otter support to be, it has in the longer run had the benefit of getting people to care a lot more about things like pollution in our water ways, the endangered status of the otters, living with wildlife in an urban environment, and even the design of our parks and green spaces.",t3_ljw2yf,15-02-2021

> In a Facebook post posted on Jan. 16, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) shared that they discovered 11,285 cartons and 7,684 packets of duty-unpaid cigarettes on Jan. 13.

> ICA managed to foil the smuggling attempt, which included the involvement of a Malaysia-registered lorry that was trying to enter Singapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint.

> Hidden in CNY-related figurines

> According to the post, the officers noticed anomalies in the x-ray images of consignments which consisted of Chinese New Year-related figurines.

> When the officers were doing the course of checks, they found uncovered contraband cigarettes concealed inside the figurines.

> This was how the figurines looked:

> The case has since been referred to Singapore Customs for further investigation.

> ICA said: ""This method of concealment is a cause for concern as similar methods may be used by people with ill intent to smuggle security items into Singapore. The ICA will continue to conduct security checks on passengers, goods and vehicles so as to safeguard Singapore's security.""

Personally, having stayed in Woodlands for over 20 years, it has been pretty terrible for me. I wasted so much of my life commuting. 

Plus food scene here is so sad. Made worse when they tore down the old Woodlands market. And if you stay on the other side where there are no hawker, with mostly food courts in neighbourhood malls, food is also generally more expensive than hawker in mature estates. 

But if you have a car, Woodlands is about equal distance to most places in SG. Almost everywhere is 30-40 mins. That's good. But at the same time, it's equally far to most workplaces, unless you work in the north. 

People love saying ""Woodlands good, go JB near"". Having been chased by gangsters there when I was younger (during sec sch) multiple times and know some of my friends who frequent there got extorted and some got car stolen or broken in, I have no love for that place. I don't even think my woodlands friends goes to JB often tbh. I have so many horror stories of Johor, it's not even funny. 

On the whole, I personally fricking dislike this sh\*thole as a long time resident, but I also rate it higher than some estates in Jurong and Punggol. Would have moved out if not for saving $ to down as much as possible for a place in town when I get married.

Sports: the area was originally a sports complex, so it makes sense the mall has them since it was supposed to be a renovation of these facilities but evolved into a full fledged mall with these features integrated into the layout. So there‚Äôs an indoor running track, badminton/TT halls, swimming pools, football field etc. There‚Äôs laser tag. And obviously all the sport stores are there too. 

Community: a lot of screenings/live performances. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been a time (pre-covid) I‚Äôve gone there in the evening and there isn‚Äôt some movie being screened or a performance. During world cup they also did match screenings there with some really nice looking cushion chairs (altho up to you to lie on something a lot of ppl have probably been on lol). Also has a pretty nice and big Public Service Centre (PSC) for settling gov stuff. 

Families: sports facilities aside, also got like those childcare etc in the basement iirc. Fairprice for grocery shopping. The hawker centre is one of those social enterprise ones so meals are very cheap, and there‚Äôs a lot of options. There is a theatre there that [screens a few current movies for a low price](https://i.imgur.com/GuiKUOv.jpg) ($6 if you watch on a weekday with OTH passion card, $9 for weekend), altho there‚Äôs no online booking [obv this isn‚Äôt open now, thanks covid].

>          SINGAPORE - SMRT&apos;s chief operations officer for rail Alvin Kek was arrested for drink driving at Woodlands Checkpoint on Saturday morning (April 21), The Straits Times understands.
In response to queries from The Straits Times, the police said they arrested a 50-year-old man for drink driving at Woodlands Checkpoint at about 5am on Saturday, without giving further details.
SMRT&apos;s vice-president for corporate communications Margaret Teo said: ""This matter is currently under police investigation. It is not appropriate for the company to comment as it concerns a personal matter. We request that the privacy of our staff, especially under the circumstances of his recent bereavement, be respected."" The Straits Times understands that Mr Kek&apos;s father died recently.
Mr Kek joined SMRT in 2013.
SMRT announced his appointment as chief operations officer (rail) on Feb 1, saying that he would oversee operations for the North-South and East-West Lines, the Circle Line and the Bukit Panjang LRT system. Prior to his employment at SMRT, Mr Kek spent 14 years with the Singapore Armed Forces, where he was a colonel and a chief engineering officer.
Police investigations are ongoing.

There are one or two nice coffeeshop food around, but you'll have to ask around your neighbours. We don't have much popular food stores around as compared to the east or central. (Like eg. Tasty chicken rice in the whole of all woodlands, I can only think of one stall in blk 304 woodlands ave 3)

> The toddler could not move her hand and would start crying when Mirielle tried to lift it up.

> Lodged police report, investigations ongoing

> Speaking to Mothership, Mirielle said that after she discovered her daughter's injury, she went down to the preschool and requested to view CCTV footage.

> ""That was when we confirmed our worse nightmare,"" she said.

> The CCTV footage, according to Mirielle, revealed an act of alleged ""physical abuse"" towards her daughter.

> She lodged a police report on Oct. 14, 2020.

> In response to Mothership's queries, the police confirmed that a report was lodged in October 2020 and investigations have commenced following the report.

> The police said that it has also been updating the victim's parents on the progress of the investigation, with the most recent update in December 2020.

> Police investigations are ongoing.

> Suspended for a week

> Mirielle confirmed with Mothership that the abuse took place in PCF Sparkletots at Block 649 Woodlands Ring Road, which her daughter has been attending since August 2019.

> The teachers who were responsible for the alleged abuse are both women in their 40s, according to Mirielle.

> Mirielle also told Mothership that the two teachers were suspended for one week, and sent to counselling.

> However, they have been re-deployed to other PCF centres.

> Authorities ""went all silent""

> In her Facebook post, Mirielle had also claimed that PCF Sparkletots and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) ""went all silent"" when she reported the matter to them.

> She wrote in her post:

> ""Hence, we have decided to speak up and seek justice for our daughter. Initially we thought of filling for a lawsuit, we have met up with multiple lawyers and their fees are beyond our affordability. After much consideration, we feel going public is the right option for us. If you think child abuse does not happen in SG childcare, think again.""

> You can view her full Facebook post here:

> ECDA's investigations

> In response to queries from Mothership, an ECDA spokesperson said that the agency is aware of the case after the parent of the child informed them in October 2020.

> ECDA said that it followed up with the parent on Oct. 12 and informed her that an investigation would be conducted.

> ""Our investigation took into account the information provided by the parent to ECDA, as well as our unannounced visit to the centre and assessment of the preschool‚Äôs physical environment and standard operating procedures, CCTV footage and interviews with relevant staff,"" said ECDA.

> Its investigations eventually found that the child's injury on Oct. 8, 2020 was ""likely caused by a member of the preschool staff, who had pulled the child by her hand into a standing position when waking her up from her nap"".

> Added ECDA:

> ""The safety and well-being of children in preschools is of utmost importance. The Early Childhood Development Agency takes a serious view towards any case of child mismanagement. ECDA follows up on every alleged child mismanagement incident. Investigations into such allegations generally require time as they involve unannounced visits to the centre, interviews with staff, review of CCTV footage and of the preschool‚Äôs processes and records, assessment of the investigation findings and actions to be taken, if necessary. [...] We had assessed that the staff's overall actions were inappropriate but not ill-intended to harm the child. In addition, we found that a second member of the staff had handled the child in an inappropriate manner to prepare the child for her milk feed but this did not cause the child‚Äôs injury. In both instances, we found the actions by the two staff to be inappropriate but not intended to cause harm to the child. Actions will be taken if findings support the allegation. Preschool operators are also reminded through regular briefings and circulars to ensure vigilant supervision of children, and to provide guidance and support to teachers on classroom management. [...] ECDA has taken action against the preschool licensee and both staff who were involved. In accordance with our regulatory framework, this took into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case including whether there was intent and the nature of the injury. In addition, we have tightened monitoring of the preschool and strongly advised the preschool to provide closer supervision to their staff on appropriate and safe practices when carrying or managing children. We have also strongly advised the preschool to provide guidance and support to the staff in classroom management.""

> According to ECDA, the parent was informed of the investigation outcome on Dec. 14, 2020.

> The parent has also since raised further concerns regarding PCF Sparkletots' principals arising from the incident.

> ECDA said that it is looking further into these additional concerns raised.

> ""We are very sorry, and deeply regret this""

> Responding to queries from Mothership, Assistant Chief Executive Officer of PCF, Tan Lee Jee, said that PCF is aware of the incident and takes it very seriously.

> She added that PCF is apologetic and remorseful about the case of abuse.

> Here's her full statement:

> ""The safety of all children in our centres is our top priority. An internal investigation by PCF and an independent investigation by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) were conducted. These investigations concluded that the child had likely sustained her injury, (a pulled elbow) due to inappropriate handling by the infant educator. We are very sorry, and deeply regret this. The educators involved are also deeply apologetic. ECDA has penalised PCF, and the two employees involved were suspended. They are now undergoing a fundamental review to assess their suitability to work in this field. Further disciplinary action may be taken against them if they fail to meet the expected standards. The parents have decided that their child should remain in the same centre with us. We thank them for their trust and will continue to support the child in her learning and development. The parents of the child have filed a police report and we will fully cooperate with the authorities on the investigations.""

I had been a ""Woodlander"" since birth, but after I left Singapore for studies and work opportunities my old flat is reconstituted as ""Marsiling,"" and a separate entity from the rest of the ""hip and cool"" Woodlands.

When I was growing up, ""Marsiling"" was a neighbourhood that overlooked the Woodlands Checkpoint and the connecting Admiralty Road West (before Woodlands Waterfront made it popular again, this was a sleepy part of Singapore that was ignored by the hustle and bustle of the ever-changing development that happened elsewhere). The former Si Ling Secondary served as a schooling ground for people of that area. People who lived in this general area (see Google Maps for the roads named ""Marsiling"") don't generally have a reputable status owing to the old and ageing population that lived there, as well as how [Si Ling was notorious previously for being a haven for gangsterism](https://fionaseah.com/tag/si-ling-secondary-school/) so it comes to mind that the denizens there are also generally less well-off and secretly troubled (they are not *as troubled* as Yishun, though).

I‚Äôve done professional lab analysis of the presence of ammonia in wastewater, using APHA4500 (standards for the examination of water and wastewater). 

May I have how you did the test yourself? Also, some more info about what reagent/indicator you are using would be great :)


Also, even though the vial is not accurate enough, you‚Äôll need to fill the water up til the calibration mark, what this means is to have the meniscus of the water level alongside the calibration mark. Even though this only contributes to negative error, I suspect that this would be a sign of various other analyst errors.

Besides, what did you rinse your equipment and apparatus with? The concentration level of ammonia is quite low (0.5ppm, approx 5mg/L). As normal tap water is not pure enough, preferably de-ionized water should be used (if you have it) or store-brought distilled water could be used.

Of course, boiled water works too, as it ‚Äúboils‚Äù the ammonia/ammonium off. However, this introduces various other errors which may affect the delicate accuracy and precision of the final reading.

Currently, I'm using a basic test kit for aquariums, API NH3/NH4 test kit with 3 different test tubes and 3 different pipettes.

Regarding water levels, its seen from a different angle but I've filled it well up to meniscus and gotten rid of parallax error.

Unfortunately, I used tap water to rinse as I'm not actually conducting water tests for accuracy and research but rather mainly because I'm moving homes and trying to see if the water running in my new home is stable and safe for aquamarine life. 

However, i do agree there are a lot of errors because previously, i has a result of 2.0ppm ammonia from contamination and many other errors. But thanks to other replies from people, I found out that the standard of drinking water is usually at a 0.5ppm, which is a relief.

The police told The Straits Times that at around 6.10am, their officers conducted checks on two men at Block 365 Woodlands Avenue 1.

During the checks, one of the men, a 22-year-old who had fresh lacerations on his left thigh, suddenly bolted and fled from the area.


Preliminary investigations revealed that he is an NSF who is wanted by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) for being Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL).

At 3.35pm, a lookout message was sent to various taxi drivers telling them to keep an eye out for the suspect, who was described as tall, slim, wearing a black shirt with shorts and slippers. He was also bleeding from his left thigh.

Anyone who spotted him was instructed to call the police at ""999"".

ST understands that the man is still at large, and no arrests have been made.

Rape has obvious victims that demand redress. Rape creates victims because someone is being forced upon and their right to exercise consent over their body is being violated.

Harshly punishing rape brings redress to rape victims and incurs few negative side effects.

At the same time, the trade in drugs is made more dangerous for everyone by the war on drugs. It creates many perverse incentives. Inelastic demand drives escalating costs for addicts that promotes property crimes as well as the use of much more dangerous substitutes (Benzos like Erimin 5 instead of opoids/weed). You artificially create a high margin market that attracts and funds dangerous criminals, that is beyond and legal system of regulation or dispute resolution.The war on drugs essentially makes CNB acts as a protection gang on behalf of drug traffickers to keep prices high and ensure that customers have no other lower risk and/or lower cost choices. So tell me in your analogy, how caning rapists affects the economics of rape in a similar way?

I sense that you are going to approach the problem you have created for yourself here by appealing to definition of what a victim is that is mentally acrobatic, proprietary and amenable to whatever 'Asian values' authoritarian nonsense you tend to push.

Singapore absolutely does not need to decriminalise drugs considering we are an extremely small country capable of being controlled by a non-corrupted government, in addition to having some of the lowest drug crimes meaning an overwhelming majority of our citizens would never feel the need to do drugs. Recreational drugs and novel antidepressants (e.g. Ketamine) is not really part of the statement I'm trying to make here. 

In fact, I will argue decriminalisation of drugs puts the country into a state of panic considering our surrounding neighbours are already struggling with managing drug crimes. The harsh stance while definitely doesn't target the crime lords themselves, deincentivises majority of people from trying to smuggle drugs into our borders.

Violation of consent is not necessary for a crime to occur. Certain drugs, especially heroin/cocaine/methamphetamine, ravage bodies regardless of consent.

Same with Singapore's stance on drugs.

I am seeking redress, and so are most of my fellow citizens. Drug addiction ruins families and communities, and forces everyone to pay for the medical expenses incurred by addicts, as well as their lost productivity.

>Inelastic demand

Your whole paragraph depends on the assumption that drug demand is inelastic, i.e. drug addicts will demand the same amount of drugs no matter how stiff the criminal penalties or how high the cost. Which is a completely risible assumption, which drug decriminalisation proponents nonetheless seem to repeat everywhere.

Repeat after me: the goal of a war on drugs isn't to *eliminate* drug abuse, but to *minimise* it. And Singapore has won her war on drugs.

The demand for drugs ( and especially hard drugs) is inelastic. Portugal, the Netherlands and others have demonstrated this. We could throw bricks of heroin from the top of UOB tower and the vast vast majority of people would not bother to pick them up. At the same time, we can lock our country down, hang the mules and make heroin cost hundreds of dollars a gram and that same proportion of users will still pay it. 

Our society and government has solved the problem of drug use by ensuring that the underlying social conditions that might feed hard drug usage don't really exist. So why continue to chase a policy that incentivises smuggling, makes drug consumption unnecessarily destructive and worsens crime? Why enforce this policy by killing people, destroying people's careers and families? Just because the government has framed the issue in a way that the costs are invisible to many Singaporeans does not mean they aren't there. We are also shutting out a lot of potential economic benefits that might arise from lower harm drugs. I want Singaporean vertical farming startups to grow cannabis, because if we restrict them to growing tomatoes and Strawberries, EDB's grant money is going to get flushed down the drain. Just because things look good when you look up from the bottom of the well does not mean there are not problems elsewhere. It also does not mean that we are optimally capturing opportunities.

Here is the thing, we don't have to do everything at one go. If you are still panicked. We can keep drugs illegal. We can start by not hanging drug mules. We can start by mandating treatment for addicts and ensuring that they don't collect a criminal record so long as they obey an addiction specialists orders. We can provide opoid addicts with methadone and lower harm alternatives.*  We can start trialing medical CBD. If we are not happy with the results we can always go back. If we are happy, we can go a little bit further one step at a time. But here is the thing, there has not been a country that has gone back to hard enforcement because, as it turns out, working with economics and science tends to work better than working against with a show of force.


*By the way, rich heroin addicts in Singapore already have access to a lot of these types of treatment via private doctors and the government has a stance of allowing it but not publicizing it.

I think I have already pre-empted all of your nonsensical arguments. I am pleased to have predicted that you essentially believe that people are state property to be freely disposed of as the current hierarchy in society deems fit. It is good to know that I understand the opposing arguments well.

Hanging people, imprisoning people and ensuring people never find a decently paying legal job again is a strange way to ""protect and help"" your fellow man. 

There is big reason why countries that have gone down the legalised/decriminalise route don't go back. Total costs to society goes down. And the negative externalities you are whining about are easier to address if we can tax and regulate it. You would be paying less than you do right now. Paying for drug enforcement l, all the externalities and 70% of our current prison population is not free. Maybe I should ""demand redress"" for this. And as a taxpayer I stand on better ground to seek redress for the harms of public policy than your stupid argument.


But here us another prediction, I think you prefer to pay more for the war on drugs rather than pay less for the alternatives. I think you prefer to force everyone else to do pay more to make society worse than pay less to make society better. For authoritarian, the punitive theatre is the point.


Demand inelasticity for illegal drugs is a widely observed phenomena, to the point that it is THE example of demand inelasticity in most undergraduate economics texts. Many features of the drug war even in Singapore are observably predicated on this. Such as people still bringing in large quantities of drugs through our border despite the lockdown to feed users who will pay whatever price for them. It is regrettable you think the intrusion of reality into your authoritarianism is risible.

I think our values are slowly changing. And not in your favour. If your best argument for your garbage is that you can summon some plurality of a group of people recovering from 150 odd years of colonialism and many of autocracy to support you, I can readily see why you are so keen to have us under someone's thumb forever.",t3_kilfpn,24-12-2020

Of course without the MRNA technology ( Thank you university of Wisconsin Madison) that can rapidly generate vaccines to chase raipd chase a fast mutating virus, we might be locking down for a very very long time. Sinovac is likely good vaccine, but the process used to make it is old and slow. It may not be effective once enough mutations occur.

""If the ""war on drug"" is ""unwinnable"", then its because the other countries are too lax and lenient on it. Our laws and enforcement ensure we don't have any of the same drug problem as elsewhere.""


I think you have no idea how things work in other countries and are relying on ethnic stereotypes to shoot from the hip. You think other countries have not been just as harsh or thorough waging this stupid war? In the US drug trafficking carries life in prison or basically the equivalent of that. This used to also be the case in much of Europe. The US ended up locking up about 2.5 million people in prison at its height. Roughly 70% of whom were in there for drug related offences. That is an astonishing percentage of their population. Much of Europe has or had a similar level and composition of incarceration to us when they were fighting drugs like this.

Also what makes you think we don't have the same problems as elsewhere? Have a guess what percentage of our prison population is in there because of the war on drugs? It is also about 70%.--So much for being so different to the west. We ruin the lives of huge numbers of people over this. We kill a lot of people over a crime that unlike rape or murder has no victims.All for nothing. The drug trade appears to be unstoppable. If we had a more open society you would find research articles discussing the street prices of drugs, you will find them utterly stable. This is baked into the economics of this and is inevitable.

You might highlight that we don't have streets full of openly high homeless addicts. I wouldn't expect that. Our economy and society does well keeping people from becoming homeless. We have a robust healthcare system and it is easier to get the mentally ill trested. These are the ways we are different from the worst PARTS of America. It clearly works.

So here is the idea: What if we transferred the resources away from failed drug enforcement/ imprisonment and towards better safeguards against homelessness and better treatment for all forms of addiction.--the policies that we already do well.  We legalise Cannabis  and other low harm drugs so they can be taxed and regulated. We provide hard drugs with a doctor's prescription while steering addicts towards lower harm alternatives. Heroin now sells for lesd than laundry detergent per kilo. No more gangs. No more mules.

Imagine the reduction in total cost to our society if 70% of our prison population were out working to feed their families tomorrow? Imagine the new industries that will arise from a regulated medicinal and recreational low harm drug trade. Imagibe all the jobs that we can create.

Certainly a presumptuous statement, don't you think so? Especially when you simply cite two sources, Netherland and Portgal. I absolutely agree on your stance on having a non-violent rehabilitation program.

Nevertheless, that statement is still bold considering that while homelessness is nearly non existent in Singapore which is a major contributor towards addiction, you're forgetting an arguably bigger contributor is mental health. I believe we can stand on the same stance that addiction is the mental submission of towards substances rather than it being physical. Simply put, people don't get addicted if they're mentally fulfilled. But Singapore definitely has an underlying mental health crisis. 

But we are not talking about rehabilitation, are we? We are talking about the criminalization and decriminalisation of drugs. So your real metric of measure is simply Portugal and arguably Oregon (very recent though) 

The idea with legal governance and providence of substances is that once given, it is very difficult to take it back e.g. alcohol, cigarettes. The idea that firstly, we are a democracy which means we do not have a one party system, just simply means the kind of irreversible consequences of decriminalising drugs just DOES NOT justify the risks. 

I still think having a good rehabilitation program and a rehoming system such as Netherland is good. But in no way should we support decriminalisation. You're making a lot of strong generalisation and assumptions of a few cases. The benefit of the doubt definitely acts against you. 

Also I believe I mentioned decriminalisation of all drugs is a ""nuke all"" approach to ending the war on drugs considering the government legalise and control the supply of drugs. But again, Portugal had their hands forced and we don't.

Enforcement. That's their weakness and problem. That's why drugs is such a problem over there. That's why they are struggling to control their own drug problems and are forced to consider legalization of drugs.

Failed Drug enforcement? What failed drug enforcement are you referring to?  Drugs enforcement is doing quite a good job over here.

Looks good to me. It means law enforcement is doing their job.

No, we did not ruin their lives. They ruined it themselves. They choose to trade or consume drug knowing full well the penalties against it. No one forced them to do this.

Cannabis is not huge problem here either.
I understanding why there countries which are considering legalization of these drugs because they are unable or unwilling to control their use.
Over here, we are still able to control it and very willing to ban their use. These drugs are not an issue here.

 > Imagine the reduction in total cost to our society if 70% of our prison population were out working to feed their families tomorrow?

True. If you are going to use numbers here, you should know that the Singapore prision services also provide rehabilitation programmes to these inmates with overall success rate of 70%. 


> There is a reason why there has never been a country that has legalized and then decided to go back to fighting the war again.

I also want it to be pointless to smuggle drugs into Singapore because our addiction recovery policies are so strong. This necessarily means that hard drugs are going to be decriminalised.

I think decriminalisation and rehabilitation go hand in hand. It is very difficult to rehabilitate people who have addiction if we also destroy their livelihoods and lock them up for years. But we can be selective and move step by step. Decriminalisation is distinct from legalisation. It can still be nominally illegal to possess heroin, but the key difference is that we are not imprisoning, caning, hanging and giving out criminal records to the people involved in hard drugs. Instead, We are giving addicts treatment in the same way that Rich Singporeans and foreigners already have access to. 

As for evidence, to a more limited degree, States that have legalised or decriminalised cannabis ( and there are now a lot of them) have also basically demonstrated that demand for cannabis is mostly inelastic. Even beyond countries that have legalised, the fact that demand for drugs seems to be unaffected by enforcement even in Singapore ( the lock down provides a pretty good natural experiment) demonstrates that demand for drugs is inelastic and the punitive approach is costly and ineffective.

We have addressed the false idea pushed by the PAP that their authoritarian way of doing this is somehow always clean, cost free and super effective. Lets address the idea that activism in Singapore is ineffective. The government is not immune to steady pressure and is loathe to become the international odd one out no matter how much they push Shan out to talk shit in front of the media. In the case of 377a, we have gone from heavy enforcement to no enforcement to pink dot. I think that what happens next depends on how daring and 'hungry' people are.

I am an engineering manager. I have seen, in the last 5 years, significant improvements in workplace safety and accountability. Many industries used to play the dirty trick of simply sending home all the foreign workers that got maimed or injured.--and the government quietly would side with them. Now all the workers know to call MOM and then call TWC2 ( the activist group, and yes, they are same guys that predicted that our worker dorms would become a pandemic breeding ground) to report your company if that shit happens. They call MOM to get enforcement and then they call TWC2 to ensure fucking Josephine Teo's Eunuchs do their job. It did not get this way because the Jo woke up one day and decided to not be a piece shit. It got this way because HOME, TWC2 and other NGO's kicked up a big fuss. They would form human chain at the airport to block companies from sending home workers without paying their medical bills. The companies responded by hiring bouncers and pai kia to try to push their way through. All this in front of foreigners at Changi airport This escalated until MOM realised that if they kept siding with the industry friends, there would be a very public scandal. Activism is effective even if the government here has a lot of defence measures to deter it and encourage learned helplessness. I have linked a list of other activist successes.

First off, who is 'we'? The British shoved the war on drugs down our throats. LKY opted to enormously expand it. He cut off jury trials when he found that it was difficult to get Singaporeans to vote to hang people. I am sure there is a hard nut minority of Authoritarian crazies like yourself, but there is no 'we' here. 99% of 'Asian values' authoritarianism is simply demanding that we blindly continue to do what we were colonised to do.


>Enforcement. That's their weakness and problem. That's why drugs is such a problem over there. That's why they are struggling to control their own drug problems and are forced to consider legalization of drugs. 

Many if the places that are have decriminalised or have decided to legalise low harms drugs have concluded that the 'problem', as far as cannabis and others is concerned is a government invented one. They haved decided that most of the problems associated with hard drug use emerge from trying to prohibit it. So they have simply decided to stop. The have decided to stop ruining their societies just to keep demented people like you happy.


>Yes I think they are not harsh enough and not thorough enough. They definitely should start considering using the death penalty. I mean death penalty already exists in the US, they just need to start applying it to the drug criminals. At least start applying to the high volume traffickers, unambiguous cases.


Demand for drugs is inelastic and does not respond to enforcement. On of the reasons Singapore cand indulge Authoritarian fantasies about harsh enforcement is our low crime rate overall. We already execute a high percentage of our murder rate here over drugs. In past years we used to hang more people over drugs than were murdered here and we would still be doing this if we did not back away from the mandatory death penalty. The US has a higher crime rate than Sg. Can you imagine how many people they are going to be killing over this it us going to wind up in the many thousands? If Singapore is backing away from this failed crazy nonsense, who are we to tell them to go ruin their society like that. Even if they weren't deciding to decriminalise, they would laugh at us.


>Looks good to me. It means law enforcement is doing their job.

I can see that you view success in term of maximizing the number of people we imprison, cane and hang. I am not sure you would even find a majority of the PAP adopting this framing.

>No, we did not ruin their lives. They ruined it themselves. They choose to trade or consume drug knowing full well the penalties against it. No one forced them to do this.

Of course by this framing, any failed policy can be seen as a success if we just blame the people that we destroy over it hard enough. 

These people are people' brother's, sisters, fathers , mothers breadwinners and employees.You say no one forced them and yet people keeping doing it and will keep doing it to the end of time. Maybe it would be better to try to manage this in a way that did not destroy so much human potential.

>Cannabis is not huge problem here either. I understanding why there countries which are considering legalization of these drugs because they are unable or unwilling to control their use. Over here, we are still able to control it and very willing to ban their use. These drugs are not an issue here.

Cannabis is a huge problem here. We should be able to go down to the shops, show IC and buy it for our enjoyment. We should be allowed to create jobs growing processing regulating and selling it. We should be allowed to make money with this opportunity. That the government has instead chosen, predictably, to hang/cane/imprison people over this is stupid and a huge problem. 


>True. If you are going to use numbers here, you should know that the Singapore prision services also provide rehabilitation programmes to these inmates with overall success rate of 70%. 

I know how they got that 70% statistic.lt is really fake and lame. They aggregate all the 'drug addicts' including all the 'addicts' who are using things like,  Cannabis, that are only addictive in your social studies textbook. They counter check 5 years after they are released to see if they have been convicted for drugs again.  Liddat, even the US has a 70% success  rate. And they barely even bothered with rehabilitation programs. 

I wonder what your success rate is for the highly addictive drug users is like?  How many of these people  we release recover their original predicted earning power?  How many of the hanged ones come back to life?

Nothing sucks away political will to revert to the war on drugs, than decriminalization. Even incremental decriminalization. I lived through decriminalization and legalisation of cannabis in Illinois. The first places to do this were rich university towns, then it spread. Middle class white people realised that their safe neighbourhoods continued to be just as safe afterwards. They realised it saved a shit load of money and created jobs and business opportunities. They saw the quality of the cannabis they were smoking improve in quality.  Everyone got something out of this except the authoritarian crazies. Now they are pushing to decriminalise hard drugs. A few counties have already done this.

The incentives to even remotely act on changing the law is not justified by its minute impact. It's really the same for 377A.

What else is our fault?


>  I lived through decriminalization and legalisation of cannabis in Illinois.

The reason cannabis is being legalised was because its usage had spread far too much for the authorities to control.
That it spread so much was due to enforcement being lax to start with. 
Cannabis usage is not the same level here. What they did there fore is really not applicable here.

You and I have a different definition of democracy.

I wonder who is the one here who really likes to control people.

Now you are turning this into some sort of class divide. Rich vs poor. This is irrelevant to the matter.  That the wealthier classes always manages to come out better is no surprise. This has been the case throughout history and is the same everywhere. It will be the same whether drugs is legalized or not.

Then we can argue it is all the more important for the government to come to ensure no drugs enter our country and community to protect the poorer classes.

First of all, you keep saying the government ruined their lives. Is the government force feeding people with drugs?
Who made the choice to use drugs in a land that have hard laws against its use and trade? 

> Hard Drugs have a foothold here, are we going to continue use this as a Duterte style excuse to trash our society?

To compare how Singapore is dealing with drugs with how Duterte is doing it and to say that they are same, is a very far far stretch.

You see anyone here telling people to go assassinate/murder suspected drug dealers?


> Or are going to progress to the point where it becomes pointless to smuggle drugs here?

I fail to see how allowing drugs to become legal and be freely available to be progress. You mean seeing people getting stoned in streets or die from overdose (one more way to kill oneself? yay?) is a sign of progress? To have the freedom to seeing your own children injecting substances in their veins is a sign of progress? To see whole families stoned or addicted in their own homes a sign of progress?
Somehow this does not feel like progress. Maybe it is progress for some countries where the government have lost control. But here in Singapore this sounds more like regression. Back to the bad old days, when gangs and triads ruled the land.",t3_kilfpn,27-12-2020

Or is there some grand conspiracy going on? I don't know if this is trolling or advanced stupidity.

The truth is that decriminalization makes the gangs disappear and ensures our addicts get proper treatment. It would allow me to go buy some cannabis to go enjoy myself. Yes, it would allow your children/mother/father/colleagues to go do the same and enjoy private activity that carries a lower risk than driving a car or drinking beer. And here is the thing. You would choose to let the government hang/imprison/cane your own father or your own children over an activity with a lower inherent risk than eating too much sugar. You would do this inspite of every credible expert on this matter saying that this is not right.So who is creating the harm here? I would say that even if these people were using heroin, the government is creating the harm.

If a triad gangster told you to do something and you disobeyed and got murdered over it, would it be sane to say that: ""Who made the choice to use drugs in a land that have hard laws against its use and trade?"" ? What if the behavior they killed you over was  problem only because the gangster said so? What if the gangsters decide to start calling themselves a government? 

 The government and the people have the responsibility to minimize the policy harm they create. You want the government to have all the power to kill dozens/hundreds of people and ruin the lives of thousands but bear no responsibility.

I want to achieve my goals by persuading people and mocking/negating people like you. I call you a fascist because you meet all the requirements for that label.

There is a class divide in Singapore  and it is highly relevant because it gives us a natural comparison. Clearly questioning hierarchies makes you angry, this is unsurprising for a fascist. 

Your reading comprehension is poor. DRUG ENFORCEMENT disadvantages the poor. The drugs themselves don't know or care if a poor person or a rich person consumes them. Furthermore, for hard drugs, it is clear that an environment that more resembles what I want, decriminalization and treatment results in far better outcomes. This should be enjoyed by everyone, not just the rich. 

 I don't think that harsh drug laws in themselves have much to say about the nature of a countries democracy. It is clear, that in 2020, expert opinion, lived experience, economics and science have shown them to be harmful. I think that if you still cling to them in 2020, there is a very high likelihood of you having a worldview that is incompatible with democracy.",t3_kilfpn,27-12-2020

I think you may be getting it the other way around.
The countries that have decriminalised drugs did so because they were forced to not because they wanted to.
They probably had plenty of gangs and addicts dying on the street in the first place that lead to it.

You see any gangs and addicts dying on our streets? I attribute this to our government's strict and effective law enforcement.

""Hey, don't do this this here. Go elsewhere to do it if you must. If you do it here, there will be consequences"",

Mocking and negating people just because they disagree though something we can do less of.

Your reasoning is one-sided and flawed. It is possible to come with points for the other side.
Ours is a capitalist society. A capitalist society left to it own, will relentlessly pursue profits and propersity

You realize that more effective enforcement at the supply side simply makes drugs more expensive in Singapore, which increases the rewards that smuggling provides? This in turn incentivises people to be even more sophisticated and violent in getting drugs through. Singapore is an island under lockdown. Drugs are still getting in.

It almost certainly makes the problem worse. The relapse rate of our Heroin and other hard drug addicts is very high.--Even CNB acknowledges this while refusing to release up to date figures. There will always be demand.

Now you are getting it! There is now way to win a war against economics by using force and violence. The way to win is to legalise low harm drugs, like Cannabis and LSD, so that I can buy them from what ever Temasek holdings affiliated company that will inevitably monopolize this in Singapore. The way to win is to allow addicts to hard drugs to get prescribed low harm alternatives like methadone so that they can kick the addiction or at worst, don't buy any more heroin from the gangs.We already quietly allow something like this for all the people who got money here. Why not go the whole hog and decriminalise being a drug addict here for everyone? You can make evading mandatory rehab treatment a crime, but don't criminalise drug addiction or being found with a small quantity of hard drugs. This will be far more effective and far fairer to everyone.

We may not need to go full Netherlands and allow people to get prescribed heroin from their doctor. You win by making it pointless to smuggle drugs into Singapore because there are not enough illegal drug buying addicts willing to pay what it costs to smuggle drugs to sustain this operation. That is the end goal. And that legalisation/decriminalisation helps our society and economy by cutting our prison population, and not waging war on poor people over drugs and creating new industries is a bonus.

You do realize by definition, a more effective enforcement means that it is effective. Which leads to less drugs coming in.

First we are talking about them consuming stuff that is purely non-essential. Something mainly taken for recreation.
Stuff with that can cause harm and have serious side effects. 
In country where there are laws against it. Well if they get caught, is it only fair that they face consequences for it.

Me on a personal level have no qualms about hanging these people. They made a choice, they face the consequences.

What I seeing is someone who seems to think the Singapore is same as some other countries such as the US.
Someone who has been blindly consuming pro-drugs information and writing and seems to think that it is applicable everywhere.
For me, personally I think there is merits in legalization of drugs in some countries.
Perhaps they have lost control of the situation with crime. Perhaps they are not willing to expend the resource for enforce anti drugs laws.
Perhaps the political situation has changed. For those countries, yes perhaps drug legalization is something to be considered.

But we are not them. We do not have a problem with crime. The vast majority of people here don't need and don't want drugs around here.
You fail to see that and you want to us to be like those countries.

I doubt they even try very hard to stop drug addiction. They let their people be lifelong addicts and who in turn influence those around them to
take up drugs and risk become addicts themselves. Freedom of choice, freedom of choosing how to live their own lives. I get it.

The US does not really stop upper middle class/rich people from using drugs. In my experience, neither does Singapore. You think Singapore works so hard at catching all the drug users? Try making some rich friends. If they wanted to catch, CNB would be camping outside Mt E.

If someone is travelling witha suitcase full of cannabis anywhere, I doubt that person is truly hapless.
He be just too high from the weed that he is carrying (if so, this can show what weed can do - makes you stupid when you are high).
Personally as a Singapore citizen, I would wish the government to uphold and enforce the laws it is appropriate.
If there is diplomatic pressure, then I leave it to the government to handle it as appropriate too. It is what it is.

should not blindly following whatever the West does. 

The example I used shows the difference in how the different countries do things and also highlight what they can or can't do.
We can see how impossible it is to enforce mandatory mask usage and social distancing (or the equivalent) over there.
For these nations, if they can't enforce something as mild as mask usage across the country, they can hardly fully enforce their drug laws as well.

The fact is that primary source of problems with drug use in society come from people like you trying to enforce prohibition. You are the primary problem.. For example, since you don't believe that properly quantifies the risks associated with drugs, both Cannabis and Opium have thousands of years of history of safe recreational in Chinese history. It was only banning the latter that made it so valuable that it enticed foreigners to smuggle it and enticed chinese people to part their solver to buy it. I think you know how that story ends. Yet the chinese chauvinist way is to look at this and conclude that we need more government gangsterism to make people obey. Imagine thinking the world revolves around a single traumatic cultural experience where your authoritarians fucked everything up for everyone. Imagine reading that cultural experience wrongly.

You want Singapore to be that same outlier, because naturally Chinese chauvinist like you learn all the wrong lessons from history. People like you think a government can ignore history, economics and science.

You seem so happy that engineers/creatives and innovators in Singapore stay underpaid and that there a few opportunities outside rent seeking  activities in our economy. The thing you treasure the most is this idea of a Singapore that is only good at obedience and that is happy to submissively watch every opportunity expand their wealth, happiness and horizons pass them by  out of fear. Read the room, no one is as happy with this as you are and Singapore will leave you behind along with all your beliefs.

You keep drawing a comparison between drugs and masks.

People obey mask mandates in Singapore to the point non compliance is not a problem. This is our government informed by good science. Many of us started voluntarily masking up even before the government told us to. Society is obeying the science, not just government. Success in controlling the pandemic creates a self reinforcing cycle of trust and compliance. You think people will listen to the government just because they threaten to be violent and punitive?

Drug enforcement in Singapore continues to be a losing hopeless challenge even though we are locked down. The government is fighting very fundamental forces of economics and is denying science. Failure us self reinforcing and we are completely outside a wide ranging expert consensus for this. No amount Qing dynasty magical mindset from people like you will change this.

I went back to the US a few weeks ago. They have no cultural experience of a pandemic like this. Everyone in my circle is masked up. Unsurprisingly, no one I know has gotten COVID. I am told that nearly everyone is masked up now, but it is still a learning process.--They did not experience SARS. I think that if the pandemic stretches on compliance will improve. You seem to think people will only do what is good for themselves and others if the government threatens to whack them?

Very likely, they did so because they were forced to (crime, societal problems, HIV infection etc).

If you want to go the scientific route, one can easy find research that suggest otherwise.
In fact, the consensus appears to be mixed and unclear.

For example:  https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/ondcp/ondcp-fact-sheets/drug-decriminalization-in-portugal-challenges-and-limitations

There's even some evidence that legalizing drugs leads to more crime.

> It was only banning the latter that made it so valuable that it enticed foreigners to smuggle it and enticed chinese people to part their solver to buy it.

Opium was banned because it led to widespread addiction by the Emperors. And it was greed by the other foreign nations that lead to the wars.
Over time, even the Western countries started banning it as well because they too had the smiliar problems.
Even they could see the problems with it. The problem was they could not really enforce the laws well enough.

> You seem so happy that engineers/creatives and innovators in Singapore stay underpaid...

Yes Singapore is a poorer place for engineers etc. I do fail to see how this has to do with drug legalization. Unless you want to tell me that getting stoned or addicted will improve innovation and lead to higher pay etc

But then the Philipines is a complex place, for the people to elect and to support him, suggests that the drug problems must gotten out of hand over there.

They are having success in cutting all the negative aspects of drug use. Legalisation of Cannabis allows many people to enjoy themselves in a safer way than drinking, tobacco or gambling. It has created a billion dollar industry producing hundreds of thousands of jobs. Any reasonable objective person would consider this a great success.

YOur Reuters article cites no statistics and no evidence to back its headline crime has increased in Amsterdam. You should read articles before you post them. 

 The report it quotes is from political opponents of the Mayor within the city council. No one in Amsterdam would even consider resuming the war on drugs. I think they should take the next step and legalise/regulate everything that would make the most sense.

You also cite an ancient report from the ONDCP ( an organization with a vested interest in banning drugs) cherry picking edge statistics from Portugal to pathetically try to discredit a far more comprehensive and definitive report from CATO ( a right of center think tank) showing highly positive results from Portugal. Has Portugal reversed course? And what has the US electorate chosen to do since this report? egalising drugs is a bipartisan issue in America now. Only the police lobby and the fundies disagree. Everyone can see through the lies. No one has any regrets.

""Opium was banned because it led to widespread addiction by the Emperors. And it was greed by the other foreign nations that lead to the wars. Over time, even the Western countries started banning it as well because they too had the smiliar problems. Even they could see the problems with it. The problem was they could not really enforce the laws well enough."" 

Opium had a 2000 year history in China at the time of the Opium war. Why all of a sudden did they feel the need to ban it? Also what makes you think the Qing emperors were so caring for the Chinese people they enslaved? It only led to widespread addiction when the Qing ran China into the ground, allowed China to stagnate and caused massive hardships for our ancestors. Blaming the foreign opium allowed them to avoid solving the hard questions about their misrule and about Chinese Feudalism.

Banning Opium made the problems worse not better, because they incentivised smuggling and the loss of China's silver surplus. It turned an addiction problem into a nation destroying problem. Think critically. Everyone is greedy, not just the foreigners. If you require the whole world to not be greedy in order for your stupid Authoritarianism to work, you will end up always being humiliated. 

Governments always look for outsiders to blame when they fuck things up for the common people. Looking at people like you, it works. I am amazed at how effective banning Opium is at making some Chinese identify with the people that oppressed our ancestors for 400 years. We should be happy that it led the destruction of the Qing even as we regret what it cost China. We should be happy that forcing China open allowed millions of our ancestors to be free to flee. We should be happy that it allowed feudalism to collapse. Your alternative is confused bullshit where you hate the white colonisers, defend the manchurian colonizers and love your ancestors being enslaved. Worse still, we were only taught to believe this bullshit in the 60s so that people like you can be pawns of government policy.

Also, your belief that the British banned opium while exporting it to China is fake news spread by Chinese racists in the 60s. Addiction was not a problem in the UK in the 1850s because their economy was booming and they had an amazing growth of a middle class. 

 Opium was legal and commonplace in the UK until the 1920s when misuse soared due to the massive psychological, social and economic problems created by the first world war. Notice that drug abuse is always low when society is functioning well and becomes high when there is underlying turmoil? Notice that you cannot solve this problem by arresting enough drug users?  The British eventually responded to this by banning the illicit use of Heroin and implementing a system where "" these drugs were available to addicts through doctors; this arrangement became known as the ""British system"" and was confirmed by the report of the Departmental Committee on Morphine and Heroin Addiction (Rolleston Committee) in 1926.[1] The Rolleston Report was followed by ""a period of nearly forty years of tranquillity in Britain, known as the Rolleston Era. During this period the medical profession regulated the distribution of licit opioid supplies and the provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Acts of 1920 and 1923 controlled illicit supplies.""[2] The medical treatment of dependent drug users was separated from the punishment of unregulated use and supply. This policy on drugs was maintained in Britain, and nowhere else, until the 1960s. Under this policy drug use remained low; there was relatively little recreational use and few dependent users, who were prescribed drugs by their doctors as part of their treatment.""


So what changed? 
""In 1961 the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs was introduced. To control global drug trading and use, it banned countries from treating addicts by prescribing illegal substances, allowing only scientific and medical uses of drugs. It was not itself binding on countries, which had to pass their own legislation.[3]

Following pressure from the US, the UK implemented the Drugs (Regulation of Misuse) Act in 1964. Although the Convention dealt with the problems of drug production and trafficking, rather than the punishment of drug users, the 1964 Act introduced criminal penalties for possession by individuals of small amounts of drugs, as well as possession with intent to traffic or deal in drugs. The police were soon given the power to stop and search people for illegal drugs.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_the_United_Kingdom

The UK was not the only country pressured into doing this. Have a guess when we started waging a war on Drugs? The Singapore misuse of drugs act only came about in 1973 in response to right wing American pressure in the 60s. We then had idiots wrapping this policy in authoritarian Chinese racial fake history so that even now that we have become aware that this policy is disastrous and that we adopted it primarily in order to carry Richard Nixon's ballsack, people like you will scream at any attempt to stop doing this stupid shit. The amount of racial pride you have at our ability to continue to enforce a failing policy that foreigners shoved down our throat is amazing. Ironically the people that did this to us learned faster than us. When we finally open up in a few decades time, it will be an American company selling us cannabis, all the scientific research on this will have been done by US universities and they will have made all the money and won all the Nobel prizes instead of us. 

As for COVID, how about this? The US government failed at getting its lockdown to work. So why should we continue to listen to their 1960s advice to wage a war on drugs? Advice they no longer follow themselves? Governments succeed when they obey science and economics. They fail when they listen to people like you who insist we must beat our heads on a wall. Drug enforcement in Singapore continues to be a losing hopeless challenge even though we are locked down. 

You can assert what you like. Tomorrow there will still be poor people in Changi prison over this and there will still be tons of drugs coming through the border. Even in this super compliant country that has mostly beaten COVID. This is what you get when you wage war on science and economics. You lose.",t3_kilfpn,05-01-2021

All negative aspects? Now I think this is a bit too much.

No matter how you want to spin this, there's plenty of negative aspects to drugs be the soft ones such as Cannabis or the hard ones as Opium.

Negative aspects (the most obvious one being that of addiction) that have convinently ignored in your writing so far.

\> YOur Reuters article cites no statistics and no evidence to back its headline crime has increased in Amsterdam. You should read articles before you post them.

The article cites a comissioned report called ""The Other Side of Amsterdam"".

It is available here [https://www.binnenlandsbestuur.nl/Uploads/2019/8/onderzoeksrapport-de-achterkant-van-amsterdam.pdf](https://www.binnenlandsbestuur.nl/Uploads/2019/8/onderzoeksrapport-de-achterkant-van-amsterdam.pdf)

Basically it studies how drug is causing problems in the city of amsterdam. It is a interesting read.

"" Amsterdam is especially an important marketplace for (international) drug trafficking, since the 1970s. The city is a 'focal point' of geo-criminalized crime in the Netherlands, Fijnaut and Bovenkerk concluded in 1996 their report for the Parliamentary Investigation Committee on Investigation (p. 7).

The drug trade is by far the most important activity in this, they added (p. 45).Wholesalers from all over the world come to Amsterdam to offer their goods or buy it up through numerous national and international branch""

Looks like legalizing drugs didn't exactly stamp out drug crime. I certainly would not want Singapore to be ""an important marketplace for drug trafficking"" which is what could happen if the singapore government took your advice.

I think drugs legalization is hardly a silver bullet that will magically solve all problem and make the world a better place.

In any case, my point in citing this stuff is not to try to provide any definitive answer to the question of drugs legalization. My point is to show that there is hardly any conclusive consensus about drug legalisation.

\> Opium had a 2000 year history in China at the time of the Opium war. Why all of a sudden did they feel the need to ban it?

The simple reason is that opium addiction had increase to the point that it could not be ignored.

[https://www.britannica.com/topic/opium-trade](https://www.britannica.com/topic/opium-trade)

"" Levels of opium addiction grew so high that it began to affect the imperial troops and the official classes. The efforts of the Qing dynasty to enforce the opium restrictions resulted in two armed conflicts between China and the West, known as the Opium Wars,""

[https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/opium-war-1839-1842](https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/opium-war-1839-1842)

""Although opium was valued as a medicine that could ease pain, assist sleep and reduce stress, by 1840 there were millions of addicts in the country.""

[https://asiapacificcurriculum.ca/learning-module/opium-wars-china](https://asiapacificcurriculum.ca/learning-module/opium-wars-china)

""By the early 19th century, more and more Chinese were smoking British opium as a recreational drug. But for many, what started as recreation soon became a punishing addiction: many people who stopped ingesting opium suffered chills, nausea, and cramps, and sometimes died from withdrawal. Once addicted, people would often do almost anything to continue to get access to the drug. The Chinese government recognized that opium was becoming a serious social problem and, in the year 1800, it banned both the production and the importation of opium. ""

&#x200B;

Banning the Opium trade was what was any minimally responsible government would done in China. The levels of addiction had already began to affect court officals and vast portion of the military. To freely allow the further spread of opium could have eventually bring end sovreign rule of the country.

As a thought experiment, imagine having half the parliament of singapore becoming addicted to a drug of which the supply is controlled by a foreign nation.

Then effectively, Singapore would be easily controlled by that other country.

\> As for COVID, how about this? The US government failed at getting its lockdown to work. So why should we continue to listen to their 1960s advice to wage a war on drugs?

My point is if the US is not able to control or influence its own people to do the sensible thing, then it is hardly of no surprise that is not winning its own war on drugs.

You can see another example of this based on what is happening in the US capital right now. If the US government can't even defend it own seat of power from rioters, then how can it defend itself from criminals?

So based this, perhaps you are right, the US government should seriously considering legalization drugs because it lacks the ability to effectively enforce its drug policies.

This is where I disagree. Gambling and drinking I can understand and that is enough. Not need to add drugs to it. I am very sure the Singapore economy can survive just fine without them.

I say you live in some idealistic world where you think what might apply (and there is still considerable debate on this) to some parts (oddly the parts with the most drug addicts) of the world applies to every part of the world.

Based on what you have written in the past, you are hardly objective yourself. You admitted to liking and have used drugs before. I am starting to wonder if you yourself are addicted and that is why you are arguing for all this pro drugs stuff. If so, I suggest you take some time to self evaluate and if necessary try to wean yourself out of it.

I am not trying to decide anything. I am writing that as someone who actually **lives in this country**, I don't want to see any drugs or any of the so call drug tourists here.

Also, use your brain. The father-in-law is most likely either getting the death penatly or he is gonna get locked up til he dies. That is incentive enough for people to not commit murder. The law does not give a shit about what other people think no matter if it is righteous or not. So you do have to worry about people being encouraged ""other people to kill their family members, if they think their anger is ""righteous""."" Again the law does not give a shit about your feelings. You commit muder, either death penalty or life imprisonment no matter the circumstances.

>do we as a society want to prevent ALL murders, or just the ones we think are ""unfair""?

The abolishing of the death penalty has 0 consideration to the victims. Every single argument that is against the death penatly solely focus on the culprit. There were 0 talks about the how the victims are being compensated or how the culprit can atone for their fking actions in the eyes of the victim's families. This is akin to Japanese teen killers in the early 21st century, where teenagers as young as fking 14 years old commits murder knowing that they will AT MOST go into juvie for AT MOST 2 years and walked free as an adult. There were many teens that specifically mentioned that they want to experience the act of killing before they became an adult. This is Japan, one of the lowest crime rates on earth with the death penalty and Japan treats them with ""fairness"" because they were just kids with 0 mentions of the victim's family.

How even with rehabilitation, he continued his killings. So tell me again how much society is willing to spend money on the criminally insane just to ""save"" a single person? Again, there will come a time where the world does not revolve around a fking serial killer, where a ton of money is gonna be heavily invested for the rehabilitation of these criminals. It is like saying a brain tumor should not be removed but we should find a way to make that tumor non-malignant. Then we talk about life sentence. Which in Singapore's case we DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LAND TO BUILD MORE PRISONS. 

If it is talking about economic cost, old people who reached retirement age have sth called savings. They contribute to the economy as a consumer. The savings does not magically disappear into government's pockets.  Also, all the talk about human rights and abolishing the death penalty, a good alternative u suggest is forced labor. Nice suggestion u hypocrite. 

Haizz...another argument without taking about the victims. This is the thing about abolishing the death penalty, it is always the argument in the side of criminals, never the innocent victims.

The burden of proof still lies on you to tell me that building more prisons for life imprisonment convicts is beneficial for the economy. Knowing that our tax dollars are going to pay for their live time stay in prison.

Again, you only talked about the culprit and the culprit's family. You shrug the victim's family off like they had it any better than the culprit. Any sane family member would understand why their family member had to die due to the crimes they commit. If one of your family members raped and murdered a kid, would you still protect him? Would u look into the eyes of the victim's mother and say that your family member deserves to live? Please answer this question. 

Not to mention most of these serial criminals have bad upbringings, abusive parents, child neglect, bad environment etc. Their parents or guardian are partly to blame for how they turned out this way. And you are saying that we should also consider their feelings too? We should encourage shitty behavior and not hold people that are partly responsible for the culprit's actions? We should never make them ""feel"" bad? 

What about the innocent victims? Its all about the culprit, how the culprit's family feeling is gonna hurt, they deserve to live because it is a human right, etc. When are you guys gonna talk about the victims? How the victim's family are going to feel knowing that their child's killer is still alive? Knowing how the culprit is gonna live peacefully in prison where both food and shelter is provided to him til the day he dies.

All this talk about you having the moral high ground and you can't even answer my simple question. Would you tell the victim's mother that your family member who raped and murdered her kid deserves to live?

So u are saying that negative feelings is sth detrimental to society? Is it quantifiable? Can we calculate the amount of negative feelings society has at any given time? Can we eat feelings? What happens when there is too little or too much negative feelings in society? How does giving a shit about negative feelings in society is any way impact society? Evidence and sources please.

Also, please read up on the effects of life sentencing. It is considered mental torture worst than death itself. + The fact that torture and rape of convicted rapists and child killers runs rampant in prison around the world. So tell me again how humane life sentences are. The reason why life sentencing is so dirt cheap in the world is because instead of killing the criminals outright, we drive them to suicide or death by another inmate. You tell me which one is the lesser of two evils. Not to mention family ties of culprit's are easily cut off when someone commits henious crimes. Some family member even committed suicide after finding out what they had done. Not to mention mob justice often takes over in developing countries when they deemed the justice system has failed them.

Honestly, attacking my family is an extremely low blow in an argument. You have limited knowledge on the subject, you wouldn't put yourself in morally grey situations, you have surface understanding of empathy and human psychology and ultimately you are being willfully ignorant.

>If you can‚Äôt see it, it‚Äôs because you only care for one party when a reasonable person would take into account the impact on everyone. If no one cares about negative feelings why even enact capital punishment ? 

Like you said u care about everyone. Yet you do not know the mental effects of life sentencing. It is being describe as mental torture to more sane inmates. You tell me if life sentencing is anymore humane than death sentence. A reasonable person would choose a quick death than subject himself to mental torture. It achieves 2 things, the victim's family will have closure that the culprit is dead and we do not mentally torture the inmate and drive him to suicide. Please read up on the fking subject of life sentencing. 

>There‚Äôs no such thing as deserving or not when something happens. Are you going to say people deserve to get cancer or covid and die ? When things happen it happens. Just because a physical entity is a perpetrator doesn‚Äôt mean we need to feel any more different from it. 

Does the victims deserve to die? Are you going to say that the victims dying in the hands of the culprit is SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS? By your logic, society killing the culprit is just something that happens. So why are you to vehemently defending something that JUST HAPPENS? Just because a physical entity is a perpetrator doesn‚Äôt mean we need to feel any more different if he is dead right? Just like we should treat victims that died as something that happens. 

> Just look at everywhere else where there isn‚Äôt capital punishment. Do people suddenly claim injustice ?

Sure if you want me to take of my retributive lens, i will do it. 

There is a ton. Mob justice still exists in parts of EU and US. Rapists and serial killers were either tortured or murdered by other inmates. Vagilantism like pedophile hunters exists and people die in these cases. Not to mention the wardens are also complicit in most of these murder and ""suicide"" cases in prisons. That is just talking about the western world mind you, we still havent talk about developing countries and we know how much worst it is there. Abolishing the death sentence just means you are letting the citizens dirtying their hands coz people like you sitting on a high horse refuse to do the dirty work for the good of your people. Which is another reason why life sentencing is dirt cheap compared to death sentence, you don't have spend money for the whole procedure if the person is dead by someone elses hands right? Its a win win situation, the person we hate dies and i pay less money. This is not a fking black and white matter. Humans in general do not like CHILD KILLERS and RAPISTS, let alone violent criminals. This is the truth about countries that abolished the death penalty, it has little to do about human rights, but money and having a good PR. It is not all sunshine and rainbows over there ffs. You are looking through a idealistic lens which is about 100 times much worst. You only see death penalty = bad, life sentence = good without going through the details. This is what i meant that you only have surface knowledge of the subject. 

> Stop being myopic, it‚Äôs obvious it‚Äôs just bureaucratic cowardice much like 377A

Stop being idealistic, a perfect world doesn't exists. That said, i love how u brought up 377A. There is a bloody reason why it isn't brought up. It has already been annouced that 377A isn't gonna be enforced in any shape way or form. In order for the law to change, there has to be an unreversible refrendum by the populace to either abolish or uphold this law. Given that Singapore is a multi-reglious and extremely conservative country, who do you think is going to win? The old geezers and hags sure as heck won't support the abolishing the law, the exetremly religious communities sure as heck won't, 1st generation Singaporeans from developing countries would bring their outdated values here. The people that supports are youngesters like us and due to ageing population we aren't the majority in Singapore.

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî Teo Ghim Heng was determined to make sure his pregnant wife and daughter were dead, which showed he was in control of his actions and made a conscious decision to end their lives, a psychiatrist testified on Thursday (July 4).

> Teo had urged his wife not to struggle, and told the four-year-old girl before strangling her to death: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be scared, papa is here.‚Äù

> While Teo also tried to kill himself ""on his own terms"", he told the psychiatrist, Dr Derrick Yeo, that he did not succeed because many of the attempts were ""either too painful or too difficult"".

> New details of the killings emerged on the third day of Teo‚Äôs murder trial on Thursday. The 43-year-old has admitted to the murders but his lawyers will seek to prove that he had a major depressive disorder at the time of the offences.

> Dr Yeo, a prosecution witness and consultant psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health, opined that Teo was not suffering from any mental disorder on Jan 20, 2017 when he killed his wife, Choong Pei Shan, and their young daughter. Dr Yeo, who interviewed Teo after the murders, instead diagnosed him with an adjustment disorder following the killings.

> For a week, Teo stayed in the flat with the two bodies. He also claimed to have tried to take his own life by setting fire to the bodies and lying next to them on the bed in the master bedroom, but later felt the fire was too hot and left the flat.

> Police officers discovered the charred bodies on Jan 28, 2017 ‚Äî the first day of Chinese New Year ‚Äî and arrested him.

> ‚ÄòYOU‚ÄôVE GOT TO LET GO ALREADY‚Äô

> On Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Han Ming Kuang took Dr Yeo through the reports he made while interviewing Teo, as part of a forensic clinical evaluation.

> Dr Yeo explained that determining an accused person‚Äôs mental state at the time helps to establish criminal responsibility, and whether a mental disorder contributed to the offences.

> The psychiatrist noted that Teo had no past psychiatric history and did not misuse substances. He had financial difficulties, and told Dr Yeo about the ‚Äúhigh expenditures he incurred on a monthly basis to maintain his lifestyle and support his wife and child‚Äù.

> On that fateful morning, Teo said he deliberately removed the girl‚Äôs preschool uniform and put her in home clothes again. An argument then broke out between him and Choong.

> It was previously revealed that Choong called him ‚Äúuseless‚Äù in front of the girl, which Teo said angered him so much that he strangled her with a towel.

> Teo had told Dr Yeo that he felt Choong would be ‚Äúhounded‚Äù by the people he owed money to, and ‚Äúmade the unilateral decision as father and head of the household to end all their lives together‚Äù.

> When Teo noticed his wife kicking her legs on the bed as she tried to resist him, he said he told her in Mandarin: ‚ÄúShan, you‚Äôve got to let go already. I owe a lot of money. If you struggle, you will suffer because I owe outside a lot of money.‚Äù

> After killing his wife, Teo turned to his daughter and assured her: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be scared, papa is here.‚Äù He also decided to kill himself ‚Äúto reunite the family‚Äù.

> Dr Yeo noted: ‚ÄúIt clearly reflects his goal-orientedness and how his actions were premeditated in that he was following the plan to end the lives of everyone in the family.‚Äù

> As Teo looped the towel around the girl‚Äôs neck, Teo recalled telling her in Mandarin: ‚ÄúGo find your mummy first, papa will come soon.‚Äù About five minutes later, he used his hands to finish the job on his daughter.

> When the psychiatrist asked him why he took the girl‚Äôs life as well, he said that he felt his family members would not be able to adequately care for her.

> Dr Yeo also considered Teo‚Äôs actions in the week following the murders. He had lied to his work supervisors about why he could not report for work, and used Choong‚Äôs mobile phone to give excuses to his family about why they could not attend Chinese New Year festivities.

> ‚ÄúHe was able to go back to watching television, driving out to buy food, all while he was researching feasible ways of ending his life. The accused also told me he tried various methods to try to end his life but he was unsuccessful. He apparently wanted to die on his own terms but many of the attempts he tried were either too painful, too difficult or not successful for him.‚Äù

> This clearly meant that he was not of unsound mind, and ‚Äúhis behaviour showed that he was in full cognitive control and volitive control‚Äù of his actions, Dr Yeo added.

> DPP Han also took him through four handwritten suicide notes that were most likely written by Teo. He had signed one of them off with his wife‚Äôs name.

> One in particular ‚Äî addressed to Teo‚Äôs and Choong‚Äôs parents ‚Äî told them to split their house, car and Central Provident Fund monies between both sets of parents.

> Dr Yeo said this showed that he had the ‚Äúpresence of mind‚Äù to make such due considerations, and was ‚Äúcognisant that these are big items that would be of help to his elderly parents‚Äù.

> NO REGRETS

> Earlier on Thursday, another medical expert, Dr Melonie Sriranganathan from Changi General Hospital, took the stand.

> During cross-examination by Teo‚Äôs lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, she testified that in the days following Teo‚Äôs arrest, he told psychiatrists in the hospital that ‚Äúhe had no regrets‚Äù.

> The only regret he had was that he had to take the life of his innocent young daughter, she added, while reading from clinical notes that her colleague Dr Ong Pui Sim had taken.

> The results of his liver function test were also consistent with a drug overdose. He had claimed to have tried to kill himself by swallowing more than 100 tablets of Panadol (paracetamol).

> The trial continues on Friday.

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî Saddled with crippling gambling debts, he could not pay his four-year-old daughter‚Äôs kindergarten fees.

> After arguing with his pregnant wife over the fees on Jan 20, 2017, Teo Ghim Heng was so overwhelmed with anger that he looped a towel around her neck, strangled her with it for 15 minutes, and then finished the job with his bare hands.

> He then turned his attention to his child and killed her the same way.

> Before their bodies were discovered in their Woodlands flat a week later, Teo repeatedly lied to family members to explain their absence at Chinese New Year reunion dinners and visits, and made himself scarce when his colleagues and family tried to visit the flat.

> He also claimed to have tried to take his own life by setting fire to the bodies and lying next to them on the bed in the master bedroom. However, he felt the fire was too hot and left the flat.

> On Jan 28, 2017, the first day of Chinese New Year, his brother-in-law finally called the authorities after noticing a pungent odour coming from the windows.

> When police officers entered the flat, they discovered the charred bodies of Teo‚Äôs wife, 39-year-old Choong Pei Shan ‚Äî who was about six months pregnant with their son at the time ‚Äî and their young girl on the bed.

> On Tuesday (July 2), Teo, now 43, began standing trial in the High Court for the double murders. A third charge of causing the death of his unborn child has been stood down.

> The former property agent and sales coordinator has admitted to the killings, but prosecutors said that his lawyers will likely argue for a general exception to murder.

> Meanwhile, the prosecution‚Äôs psychiatrist will testify that Teo did not have major depressive disorder or any mental disorder, and was not of unsound mind at the time.

> Murder carries either the death penalty or life imprisonment.

> ‚ÄòWEAKNESS FOR GAMBLING‚Äô

> Addressing the court on Tuesday morning, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Han Ming Kuang said that Teo was a successful property agent and the sole breadwinner of the family. However, he was not earning enough when business slowed for a few years.

> ‚ÄúHe also had a weakness for gambling and spent hundreds of dollars a week on 4D. He lost most of the money. He borrowed from colleagues to sustain his lifestyle,‚Äù the prosecutor said.

> By 2017, he had amassed debts of more than S$70,000. The child‚Äôs kindergarten fees were also in arrears.

> To pull in extra cash, he began working as a sales coordinator with Carpentry Design Works in October 2016.

> ‚ÄúHe felt that (his wife) Pei Shan should have contributed to the household income by working. He also never fully forgave her for an affair she had a few years back, and strongly suspected that the child was not his biological daughter,‚Äù DPP Han added.

> The Chinese New Year festivities meant more expenses, and his debtors were asking for their money back. On Jan 18, 2017, during an argument with Mdm Choong over their finances, he told her he was unable to pay their daughter‚Äôs school fees.

> Two days later, sometime between 8am and 11am, they had a similar fight. The girl was home as well, as Teo said her school had reminded him about the overdue school fees and he decided not to take her there.

> After killing Mdm Choong, he claimed that he went over to the girl, who was in the room playing with her toys and watching television, and strangled her to death as well.

> He placed their bodies side by side on the bed in the master bedroom, turned on the air-conditioner and sealed the windows to delay the decomposition process for as long as possible, DPP Han added.

> LIED ABOUT SUICIDE PACT

> In his statements to the police, Teo recounted the events leading up to the discovery of the bodies.

> On one occasion, three days after the murders, Teo‚Äôs bosses and a colleague from Carpentry Design went to his flat after he failed to turn up for work.

> His bosses, Husniyati Omar and Aszrul Yusoff, turned out to be a husband-and-wife team who have since been jailed for cheating homeowners and subcontractors of almost S$1.7m in a wide-ranging renovation scam.¬†

> He did not respond, and lowered the volume on his television.

> When the police and firefighters from the Singapore Civil Defence Force arrived at the flat on Jan 28, 2017, Teo attempted to flee but was apprehended.

> DPP Han said that Teo lied to officers at the scene that he had entered into a suicide pact with his wife ‚Äî she had killed their daughter, and he killed her before he was supposed to kill himself.

> He repeated the lie to investigators the next day, the prosecutor added, before admitting in his later statements that he strangled both of them to death. One of his laptops was found to contain suicide-related Internet searches and website visits.

> An autopsy showed that Teo‚Äôs wife‚Äôs and daughter‚Äôs deaths were consistent with smothering or strangulation.

> After he had cleared immigration, Asrul Nizam Jamil, got out of his lorry at about 2.50am on Thursday while his vehicle was being subjected to further checks, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said in response to queries from Channel NewsAsia.

> Checkpoint operations were temporarily suspended to locate the driver.

> ICA officers subsequently found approximately 5,000 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes hidden in the lorry.

> Investigations following his arrest are ongoing, said ICA.

> In a Facebook post at about 5am, the ICA warned of delays at the checkpoint as it is implementing ""enhanced checks"" due to ""an ongoing operation"".

> In an update about an hour later, the ICA warned of heavy arrival traffic.

> ""Heavy arrival traffic at Woodlands Checkpoint due to usual morning peak period and build up from earlier operation,"" it said, without elaborating on the details of the operation. ""Delay is expected.""

> It advised travellers to check the One Motoring website before starting their trips.

> Photos and videos showed traffic at a standstill and huge jams at the checkpoint.

> Motorists reported being stuck since about 3am.

> ""It seems Woodlands Checkpoint is on lockdown,"" Facebook user Nikhil Bhardwaj posted at about 4.15am on the ICA Facebook page. ""Any idea on when normal flow will resume? Been stuck for an hour already.""",t3_8wj3m2,06-07-2018

> SINGAPORE: Four teenagers entered a switch room and turned off the power supply to an entire Housing Development Board (HDB) block in Woodlands, cutting off electricity to its residents for an hour.

> For his actions, Randy Cheang Jia Le was given 15 months' probation on Wednesday (Jul 24), while his friend Megat Muhammad Harith Hairolnizan was given a year's probation.

> They each have to perform 130 hours of community service. The cases for the other two are pending.

> The court heard that the four 17-year-old teenagers met at 10pm on Feb 28 this year for supper at a coffee shop at Block 780, Woodlands Crescent.

> After finishing their meal, they walked past a switch room at Block 759, Woodlands Avenue 6.

> Cheang noticed that the lock of the door was flimsy and pulled on it. When it came off, he entered the room with Megat, while their other friends Cheok Kai Jie and Brian Ong Wee Leong stayed outside as look-outs.

> Inside the room, Cheang saw a large black switch and suggested to Megat to pull the switch. Megat pulled it part of the way down, and Cheang completed the pull, switching off the power supply to Block 759, Woodlands Avenue 6.

> ""As a result, all the lights of the entire HDB block were switched off,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Eugene Teh.

> The two teens ran out of the switch room. Electricity supply to all 114 units in the block was out for about an hour and was restored only at 12.37am on Mar 1. The crime was reported by a senior property officer from Sembawang Town Council.

> 

> Cheang pleaded guilty to one charge of mischief, with a second charge of turning off the power supply of another Woodlands block and a third charge of trespassing into Evergreen Primary School taken into consideration.

> Megat pleaded guilty to one charge of mischief, with a second charge of switching the power supply of the second block in Woodlands taken into consideration.

> Both boys must also be placed on an electronic monitoring scheme for four months or until they enlist for national service, whichever is earlier. Their parents furnished bonds of S$5,000 for each of them.

> Cheok is set to be sentenced next week for his part in the crime, while Ong will return to court for a further mention of his case in August.

> The maximum penalty for mischief is a year's jail, fine, or both.

It's $850 after subsidies. Working mothers get $300 subsidise while housewives get half of that. Why?",t3_c8latu,03-07-2019
2554,25,esnnhwp,t3_c8latu,"> # Woodlands double murder: ‚ÄòLook at how useless your father is‚Äô ‚Äî victim‚Äôs last words before husband strangled her

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî For several months, Teo Ghim Heng was late with his four-year-old daughter‚Äôs kindergarten fees. The situation worsened to the point where he owed the centre ‚Äî Little Tree House preschool at Sembawang ‚Äî two months of fees, amounting to S$1,700.

> The issue had strained relations between Teo and his wife, Choong Pei Shan, and things came to a head on January 20, 2017 when he stopped his daughter from going to the preschool.

> This led to a heated argument with his wife which ended in a double tragedy.

> Teo, 43, who is on trial for strangling his wife and child to death, had recounted to the police what happened in the lead-up to the killings.

> On Wednesday (July 3), the second day of the trial, the court heard that Teo had said in a police statement that his wife began scolding him. This was after he told her why their daughter was not going to the centre that day: He did not have money to pay her fees, and it would be ‚Äúvery embarrassing‚Äù if she was asked to leave school.

> ‚ÄúOther families can take care of three kids, you can‚Äôt even provide for a family with one child, you are so useless,‚Äù said Choong, according to Teo.

> Teo recounted: ‚ÄúMy mind tuned out her nagging at this point and it started to draw a blank‚Ä¶ As she nagged, I remember the anger building up inside me slowly. The last thing I recall her saying in Mandarin was: ‚Äò(Child), look at how useless your father is.‚Äô‚Äù

> Teo‚Äôs recollection of the argument in his statement to the police was read out by his lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam during cross-examination of Choong‚Äôs brother, Mr Choong Mun Shen.

> Mr Choong agreed with Mr Thuraisingam‚Äôs assertion that it was ‚Äúvery unusual‚Äù for his sister to utter these words, as she was ‚Äúsoft-spoken‚Äù.

> Teo has admitted to killing his wife and daughter eight days before he was nabbed in his flat on the first day of Chinese New Year in 2017.

> Their charred bodies were discovered on the bed in the master bedroom. The girl cannot be named as she is a minor.

> The couple were having financial difficulties and he had taken on an additional job as a sales coordinator, as he was heavily in debt from gambling.¬†

> Under questioning by Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Ng Jun Chong, Ms Faizahhanim Ahmad ‚Äî the former principal of the preschool which Teo‚Äôs daughter had attended ‚Äî testified on Wednesday that the girl‚Äôs monthly school fees amounted to S$850 after government subsidies.

> Teo was late in paying the fees from the middle of 2016 till December that year, when he stopped paying all together.

> When DPP Chong asked her to elaborate on the government subsidies, Ms Faizahhanim said that the child was not eligible for additional subsidies as Choong was a housewife.

> Working mothers get S$300 in subsidies for kindergarten school fees, while non-working mothers get half that.

> When Mr Thuraisingam objected to this line of questioning, the prosecution told Justice Kannan Ramesh that Teo had given evidence in a police statement about wanting his wife to contribute to the family income, and had also referred to the issue of subsidies.

> ‚ÄòNOW, CNY IS A TORTURE‚Äô: VICTIM‚ÄôS BROTHER

> Earlier, an emotional Mr Choong Mun Shen told the court how his family has been affected by the murders.

> ‚ÄúNow, Chinese New Year every year to us is a torture‚Ä¶ My parents try their best not to talk about it but I know how much they suffer,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen they see other children at the playground or even outside, I try to bring them away.‚Äù

> He added that he and his other sister ‚Äúhave no choice but to carry on‚Äù, while his mother would ask him every day why his sister was ‚Äúgone‚Äù.

> ‚ÄúI do not have an answer for her‚Ä¶ I told her I do not know where my late sister and (her daughter) are now, but I believe that both of them are looking down at all of us. They won‚Äôt want the both of you to be unhappy to suffer. But I dare to say one thing ‚Äî my father and mother are suffering now,‚Äù he said.

> Teo‚Äôs employer, Ms Husniyati Omar, also took the stand on Wednesday and testified to his relationship with his wife and daughter, as well as Teo‚Äôs financial difficulties.

> Husniyati is currently in jail for cheating homeowners and subcontractors of more than S$1.7 million. She did this while heading Carpentry Design Works with her husband, who is also in prison.

> Teo, a former property agent, joined the company in October 2016 on the recommendation of his friend Jordan Lim, who worked as a sales manager there.

> During cross-examination by Mr Thuraisingam, Husniyati told the court that she learned that Teo had owed Mr Lim money after she saw them arguing.

> From then on, she knew that Teo had problems with his finances. She added that she lent him money and gave him advances on his monthly S$1,500 salary. She also suggested to him that the couple transfer their daughter to a more affordable kindergarten.

> ‚ÄúI even had a nice small chat with the wife‚Ä¶ From the way I conversed with her, it seems she wants certain certain things (which) she‚Äôs used to having, so she doesn‚Äôt want to change,‚Äù Husniyati added.

> She had met the family twice ‚Äî at Kiddy Palace in Woodlands, and then the next day on Christmas Day in 2016 at her birthday party.

> Husniyati said that in her opinion, Teo was ‚Äúa very doting father‚Äù and loved his wife and daughter. He would run after the girl to feed her and also held his wife‚Äôs hand, she recounted.

> ‚ÄúHe had this special request for him to be excused from work from 4.30pm to 6pm every day, Monday to Friday, (so that he could) pick the girl up from school,‚Äù Husniyati added. ‚ÄúHe would buy dinner, send the girl home and give food to his wife. Then he‚Äôd come back to the office and work late till 9 to 10pm.‚Äù

> The trial continues on Wednesday afternoon.

There was a concrete building on the right side of the road, covered by trees facing the yellow and black barrier. It wasn't fenced up in the past. We cycled past that building and stopped just 50m ahead for a puff. Then we saw an uncle walking towards and past us. We couldn't see his face clearly as it was the part of the road that wasn't lit. 

When we were done in around 4-5mins, we decided to head back where we came from. We didn't see the uncle. There's no other places he can walk on other than the road and the sidewalk facing the sea. There was nobody at all.

Then the street lamp above us flickered and went off. At that moment, we knew something's not right. We freaked the fuck out of there. 

After we were 100m ahead. We looked around and back at the street lamp. The light was lit again. Then the dumbass in me and another friend decided to cycle back for the thrill of it. 

We reached and nothing happened. Just as we were about to cycle off, the lights went off again. 

We nope the fuck out of there.",t3_eolsm8,15-01-2020

2591,25,fegduqr,t3_eolsm8,"One of the most scariest experiences in my life happened around 2-3 years ago. 

Basically what happened is that we were followed by a being who we named ""Shuib"", just a funny name that we can joke about and to not be scared of it. 

I was hanging out with my friend near in Admiralty Park it was 11pm. I asked him if he wants to go to Woodlands Waterfront which was not far away (Walking Distance).

So Admiralty Park has like shelters and playgrounds in it. But if you continue walking deeper into the park, you would see a Sakura Restaurant. That area had a path into the forest where you can cut into and reach Woodlands Waterfront.

So keep in mind it was 11pm. The area around Sakura, the shelters and playground  was well-lit. But the walkway into the forest was not. The reason for this was that it was something like a natural reserve and so the artificial lights might negatively affect the animals there.

Me and my friend were standing in front of the walkway, it was dark. So dark that you probably couldn't even see 10m into the path. We were pretty hesitant about going in. But we were like ""fuck it"", and just went in. 

We turned on our phone flashlights so that we could atleast see where we were walking. 

First thing that happened, my friend heard whispering  on our left, he thought it was me and he just asked me ""What?"". 

I was confused and just asked him ""What's wrong?"". 

He figured out that it wasn't me who was whispering and he didn't want to make both of us scared and so we kept walking. 

At the time the pathway was made out of gravel so we could here our footsteps easily. I was zoning out thinking about how crunchy our footsteps sound. 

That's when it happened. We heard a woman's laughter on our left. It was quiet soft but it was audible enough to be heard by the both of us. 

We were both slightly taken aback and kept walking. And it kept continuing until we were both annoyed and lashed out at whatever was making that noise. 

""Eh buto, diam la sial!"" That was the exact words that came out of my mouth. (Translation: basically I told it to stfu) 

Big mistake.

It was as though we had acknowledged it's presence. The laugh became even louder. Each time we scolded it, the laughter would increase its volume. To the point that the laughter was coming from all sides and it was piercing our ear

Realizing that telling it to keep quiet was a mistake, we were the ones who kept quiet and walked on. We reached to the part where the pathway was already concrete and there was a shelter and a toilet in sight.

We were pretty relieved, as this meant that we were close to the exit but not yet. We still have a couple of ways to go.

There was a staircase leading down to continue the path and exit to Woodlands Waterfront. Right before when we stepped outside, a branch fell to our side. But we didn't really care and was just thinking that it was just an act of nature. 

You thought that was it? Oh no, we're only halfway through the story. 

We reached the Waterfront, chilled at the jetty and by now it was already close to 12:15am. 

We decided it was time to go. We had 2 choices go to the bus-stop that was near the entrance (nearby the area where we got spooked or go to the one that was near my friends house. 

Without a single doubt in our minds, we decided upon the latter. 

And guess what? The way to my friend house was the walkway where this I found the lady in white hat & dress from the post above. 

However this incident happened way before that. 

Many stranger incidents happened when we were on the way there but I'm gonna cut here first. I scared that later too many words cannot post.",t3_eolsm8,15-01-2020

Gran just kept walking and this lady approached her and tried to hand her the baby. Gran kept refusing and was weirded out. She kept walking, ignoring the persuasive lady. It stopped and when she reached her workplace, she related the incident to her colleagues. One woman gasped and said that it's a ghost from a folklore that when a woman dies unnaturally with her baby, she will become a vengeful spirit and will try giving her 'baby' to unsuspecting victims. And then after they walk a few metres with it,the baby will start wailing and the mum/lady will shriek in rage and fly after the victim to get em.

Strange incidents happened when we were there.

So we were on the way there, the path was facing the woodlands custom. So on the left of us was a road and a forest and to the right was the Straits of Johor (basically the sea).

So first thing that happened. We were walking and from a distance we saw someone looking at us. As we got closer we realized it was an old Malay uncle.

And like literally everybody else we planned to walk past the guy and just ignored him.

But when we got within speaking distance with him, he talked to us.

Here's what I thought I heard him say.

""Ape korang buat kat sini malam-malam, korang tak sekolah pe?"" Translation : What are you guys doing here? Don't you have school tomorrow? In like a somewhat rude tone.

So I was abit annoyed, it's none of his business about what either of us were doing here. I replied to him quite agitatedly.

"" Hah? Kau cakap ape?"" Translation : Hah? What did you say?

All this while my friend looked at me like I was doing something weird. That was because he had his earphones on and was ignoring the guy but he saw me talking to him.

My friend then asked the guy what he was saying.

He repeated but it was not quite what he had said before.

He asked us what time it was, I told him it was 12:15am and we kept walking. 

My friend said to him ""Assalamualaikum"" which is a common way to say goodbye or hello but it means 'may peace be with you'.

All we heard was 'kumsalam' he was supposed to say ""Waalaikumusallam"" which means, 'may peace be with you, too'.

We thought it was weird that he didn't say it properly but whatever. Not our problem.

We continued walking but not even 10 seconds later he we heard a branch snapping and falling. Exactly like the one we heard before reaching the waterfront.

So we heard it but didn't care, probably was some stupid monkey or something. Kept on walking.

Then we heard it again. That's when I realized ""Oh shit whatever that was in Admiralty Park forest was following us.""

I told that to my friend but he said to not acknowledge it like we did last time. So as we walked the branches kept on snapping and falling. There were some people there too and they were looking to direction in the forest.

At the 4th or 5th time it snapped we both got pretty scared. Because it's fucking official that something was indeed following us.

And now we were near the exit, we had to walk on the road and turned left. So the road is pretty damn near the forest. And at the left turn it was the closest we were to the forest.

*BAM* The last branch just fell beside us, holy fucking shit. We flinched but did not look to the left, we knew whatever was doing this to us was just beside us standing in the forest. We could make out a somewhat humanoid figure from our peripheral vision.

So brisk walked the fuck outta there. I took a bus and was on the way out of there. My friend who lived in that area had to walk even more to reach his house. And even when he was walking home, the trees nearby also had branches snapping.",t3_eolsm8,15-01-2020

> Accident sent four to hospital

> According to the girl's father, who spoke to 8World, she remained unconscious after a day and the doctor advised that the next few days were critical for her.

> When the passengers in the van and car were conveyed to the hospital after the accident, they were still conscious, said the police.

> In a video posted by ROADS.sg, a red Audi could be seen driving along the right-most lane of the road when it slammed its brakes as a grey van suddenly pulled it front of it while making a turn.

> Colliding with the back of the grey van, both vehicles were sent spinning.

> During the collision, the girl and her 23-year-old cousin were both sent flying out of the vehicle.

> The driver of the van was arrested for dangerous driving causing hurt.

> Eight-year-old girl suffered fractures in both legs

> Her condition has been unstable, but has improved slightly overall.

> However, the doctor said that the next few days are still critical as there are blood clots present in her brain.

> Saying that he knew his brother-in-law would already be feeling guilty due to the hurt caused, he felt that there was no need to blame him for the incident.

When I was in secondary school many many moons ago, one of my friend's parents offered to chaperon us to some event, turns out the dad drives a van. It was normal for my friend. She just sat there like nobody business.
 
It was legit one of the scariest shit I've ever rode in. It was fucking bumpy and the only thing I had to grab was the fence thing inside the van. There was a strap (to strap cargo down or whatever, but it was also fucking shit). I remember I kept sliding and bumping around around at the back, it was honestly one of the worst land vehicle experiences I ever had. 

I will never ever ride in a van again (at least at the back) unless I'm sure there's something solid to grab hold of. 

Reading this news, if the girl was indeed at the back and there was a sudden impact, it is no surprise she would have been battered and flung out hard since the vehicle was spinning for some time.

You've raised valid points on timing and the red car being visible to the van. However, it is possible that the van driver scanned & cleared the road as it was empty and proceed to make the u-turn. Cause that is how u-turns are, the stretch of road is empty, you go.   
You can't possibly sit there and anticipate the likelihood of speeding cars and not commit to the u-turn. The van driver cleared the path and commit, the van was already accelerating into the turn, it was not like he moved off from stationary while the red car was visible.

In this very case, the stretch of visible road doesn't really expand too far out. The most you can clear would be like you said 10 meters, which isn't really that much of a distance if a car is speeding, it simply didn't leave enough room for a driver to take that turn safely.

70 on a 50 road means there could be elderly or road crossings. Vehicles that could stop by the road side.

> SINGAPORE: Cargo drivers entering Singapore from Malaysia via the Tuas and Woodlands checkpoints will be required to be tested for COVID-19 starting Friday (Jan 22).

> From 9am on Friday, COVID-19 antigen rapid testing will be progressively rolled out at the two checkpoints for cargo drivers and accompanying personnel entering Singapore, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Thursday.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> They will be allowed to enter Singapore if their results are negative.

> ""As cargo drivers and accompanying personnel could have interactions with the local community in Singapore, introducing an on-arrival (antigen rapid test) will allow us to identify potential COVID-19 cases and mitigate the risk further,"" said MTI.

> This will add to the safeguards ensuring public health in Singapore, as well as for the community of cargo drivers and accompanying personnel, the ministry said.

> ""We recognise the importance of ensuring the smooth passage of goods between Singapore and Malaysia and value the important role of the cargo drivers and accompanying personnel,"" said MTI.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""We will ensure smooth operations at the checkpoints to minimise disruptions to deliveries and supply chains.""

> Businesses expecting deliveries are encouraged to maintain close communication with their logistic providers and cater for possible delays, added the ministry.

> Businesses, cargo drivers and accompanying personnel must also continue to abide by safe management measures, including contactless delivery, wearing of masks and safe distancing.

> Advertisement

> Antigen rapid tests can return results within half an hour, according to the Ministry of Health.

> They have a lower accuracy rate than polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which take at least a day to return results.

Where do we let them wait? How about perishables waiting to enter SG under the hot sun? I mean there is a limit on how much earlier we can request all these Malaysian cargo drivers to reach SG earlier to make up for the ART waiting time. The travelling time for your vegetables coming down from Cameron Highlands to Woodlands already **take more than six hours**.

The worries are legitimate but there are no easy answers.",t3_l1wp16,21-01-2021

Truckers are normally low risk since they spend most of their time on the road alone or with a minder.

I agree that it's a safety thing. Just because one person's ailments seem like nothing doesn't mean the person is malingering. Just because someone is exhibiting the same signs as another doesn't mean they have the same situation. That's fair enough, and each person should be treated separately, *based on that person's own history*.

That being said, for someone who's constantly malingered, they've clearly taken advantage of the very system that's supposed to save their lives. The job of the doc is still to ensure everyone gets the care they deserve, but I'd think they do have to make judgement calls over which cases are real and which cases are not, or which cases are more/less severe (and hence will take up valuable time and resources that could end up treating someone else, like you, with real ailments).

I'm not talking about people with low tolerance for discomfort, or who need a mental break, or even like hypochondriacs. Those are all pretty legit reasons. I'm referring to people who are clearly faking because they don't want to do their duty (not because they're unable to).

> Heated argument

> The footage, posted to Facebook page All Singapore Stuff, showed the man heatedly talking to another man behind the counter of a convenience store or mama shop at Woodlands.

> According to the date on the footage, the incident apparently occurred on Nov. 2, at around 12:05am.

> The man angrily points at various things, including the staff, himself, and items outside of the camera's view.

> The staff attempts to rebuff him, and at certain points, appears to try to stave off the man's tirade by ignoring him.

> However, the man does not seem to be appeased.

> Hits display rack, causing it to topple

> At some point, the footage shows him conversing on the phone.

> The man then decides to storm off, but not before swiping violently at a rack of items on the cashier counter, causing it to topple over and spill across the floor.

> The caption in the Facebook post alleged that the dispute revolved around the sale of alcohol.

> In response to Mothership's queries, the Singapore Police said they were alerted to a case of mischief at Blk 304 Woodlands Street 31 at about 12:47am.

Wild bettas are beautiful, but I really hope more is being done to breed the various species in captivity, and not rely so heavily on wild-caught fish.

They did very well, although they were always quite shy and spent a lot of time hiding from view. Unfortunately that tank got wiped out when something died over the weekend and caused the system to crash; only the croaking gouramis and whitespots (both wild-caught) survived. 

My Betta imbellis, on the other hand, had a tank all to themselves. I wish I'd kept some of the fry from that spawning, instead of giving all of them away.

Columnaris is nasty; it's wiped out guppies from my current community setup repeatedly; for some reason only livebearers are affected, while other types of fishes do just fine. Treated it with antibiotics (kanamycin iirc), and it seemed to clear up, but for now the guppies are in a separate setup.

Hopefully someone somewhere has a breeding colony of Betta omega. I'm really worried about all the extinctions of freshwater fishes in our region, especially the blackwater and peat swamp endemics. Sigh.

ICA said in a Facebook post that in both cases, the packets of bak kwa were concealed in pastry or cookie packaging.
""As Malaysia is not an approved country for the importation of meat products by travellers, the packets of bak kwa were disposed of,"" ICA said. The authority added that the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) is conducting further investigations.
It reminded travellers that controlled items, such as bak kwa, are subjected to travellers&apos; allowance from approved countries.
Livestock, meat and meat products can be imported only from sources that meet AVA&apos;s animal health and food safety standards, the post said. Travellers are not allowed to bring in meat, meat products and eggs from Malaysia. There are currently 21 AVA-approved countries, including Canada, Netherlands and the United States, for the import of pork and pork products to Singapore.

> The incident allegedly occurred in a toilet at Woodlands Checkpoint on 16 August last year.

> As a result, the suspect passed an instant urine test.

> Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) staff sergeant Mohamed Hafiz Lan, 41, is accused of replacing Maung Moe Min‚Äôs urine sample with his own.

> Meanwhile, staff sergeant Abdul Rahman Kadir, 43, and sergeant Muhammad Zuhairi Zainuri, 31, are accused of abetting Hafiz in the conspiracy.

> In a statement, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau said the case was referred to it by the CNB.

> ‚ÄúLaw enforcement officers have the duty to maintain the rule of law and uphold justice. Those who choose to obstruct the course of justice must bear the full weight of the law,‚Äù it said.

1) Why isn't this included in our covid case count, despite potentially being infectious during his previous visit, where he mingled with the community? Moreover, he was at woodlands checkpoint which is already singapore soil right?

2) The rapid test came back positive 3 days ago while PCR test came back positive 2 days ago, but today is the first time we hear anything about it?

3) MOH said a few days ago that there will be on arrival serological tests for work permit holders, to check for past infection and exclude them from the case count. There was some mention of this from 16-19 Feb in the MOH press release.

On 19 Feb, they mentioned that one of these serological tests came back positive but they decided to treat it as an active case since they can't conclude she's not infectious.

On 20 and 21 Feb, there's no more mention of the on arrival serological test. Today, there's 3 work permit holder cases. Does that mean they scraped the idea of detecting past infections on arrival? Or did they test negative for the on arrival tests but positive after the SHN?",t3_loz2im,21-02-2021

> SINGAPORE: A man shown in viral videos in a stand-off with police near Woodlands Checkpoint last year pleaded guilty on Wednesday (Aug 28) to a variety of charges including armed robbery, drug-related offences and traffic violations.

> Chew Guan Mong, a 45-year-old Singaporean, pleaded guilty to 16 charges including robbing a woman of her car, taking methamphetamine and vandalism. Another 25 charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The incident that resulted in the stand-off started on the afternoon of Jan 5, 2018, when Chew was driving along the Pan Island Expressway towards Tuas.

> He had earlier been banned from driving from August 2004 to August 2034, but drove a rented black Toyota Camry in a zig-zag pattern anyway.

> Near the exit to Clementi Road, he swerved onto the path of an SMRT bus, side-swiping it, before veering to the left and bouncing off the wall, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Andre Chong.

> After colliding into the centre guard railings and a wall near the road shoulder, Chew abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot, the court heard.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> HE RAN DOWN SLIP ROAD, ROBBED WOMAN OF HER CAR

> Chew then ran across the centre divider of the expressway in the opposite direction, before going down the slope of a slip road merging into Upper Bukit Timah Road.

> He held a bag containing a sickle, a long rusty knife and a bottle of kerosene.

> As he neared the end of the slip road, Chew went to a red Mazda 6 driven by a 40-year-old woman, which had stopped due to heavy traffic.

> Chew opened the driver's door, brandished the sickle at the victim and shouted at her to leave.

> Fearing for her safety, the woman alighted and Chew drove off in the direction of Bukit Timah Expressway.

> He arrived at Woodlands Checkpoint but entered the motorcycle lane by mistake and was eventually stuck in the lane due to the narrowing road, said the prosecutor.

> ""In his desperation to escape, he intentionally crashed through a traffic control barrier, which is public property belonging to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), causing damages amounting to S$6,516.30,"" said the prosecution.

> The stolen car was so damaged from the repeated collisions that it could no longer be driven.

> BRANDISHED SICKLE AT OFFICERS

> When the police, ICA officers and AETOS auxiliary officers approached the vehicle, Chew alighted with the sickle in his hands, brandishing it at the officers and warning them not to approach him.

> He was eventually subdued and arrested. A packet containing methamphetamine was found in his possession.

> Apart from the offences leading up to the stand-off, Chew admitted to his involvement in various other crimes including three separate loan shark harassment incidents, possessing a knuckle-duster and a flick knife, and consuming meth.

> Chew, who is represented by lawyer Josephus Tan, was also involved in the handling of S$80,000 which was ransom for a kidnapping orchestrated by criminals in Malaysia.

> District Judge Ng Peng Hong called for a preventive detention report to be prepared and adjourned sentencing to Sep 17.

They later added more lines in the north that absorbed branch line into a continuous NS line. This means that those heading towards jurong east now had an additional route, via woodlands, hence the small print ""via woodlands""

>The MRT has since been expanded. The first expansion was in 1996. This was a S$1.2 billion expansion of the North South Line into Woodlands, merging the Branch Line into the North South Line and joining Yishun and Choa Chu Kang Stations.

3153,25,du6dup2,t3_7x8lts,"Would say that it's more to let commuters know that the direct route may not necessarily mean the shortest route.

e.g. From Bukit Batok to City Hall ‚Äì one *can* take the Red line all the way, but it's much faster to transfer at JE and take the Green line instead. Those who are not so familiar with travel times may end up thinking that a direct route=a faster route; this is especially the case with tourists.

3155,25,du6gkhf,t3_7x8lts,"It's simple. Let's say you are at AMK station. You wanna go Bukit Batok and you don't know which train to take. First guess would be ""It's near Jurong East, so I'll take the red line towards JE!"" But you see the signage and it says ""to Jurong East via Woodlands"" and you'll be like ""wtf I need go all the way to woodlands(north) then go JE(west)??""

It's basically to tell commuters that it will pass through Woodlands which is popularly very north and far away from the rest of SG. The North South Line is a mess in which the northbound train is towards MSP and the south bound train can go towards the north due to the urban geography of the planned towns in Singapore (surrounding the central catchment area). This is just a way for SMRT to guide commuters to take a more ideal route and to let them know that they will go around via woodlands rather than thru straight to JE.",t3_7x8lts,13-02-2018
3156,25,du6bldu,t3_7x8lts,"Here is my theory. (Not very confident in my answer)

1. It is for easier commuting to the neighbouring Malaysia via Woodlands.
2. Back then when the North-South Line was first constructed, it was from only Yio Chu Lang to Toa Payoh in 1987. Then, there was the sight extension towards Yishun and Marina Bay. The first official extension of the North South Line is to close up the gap from Choa Chu Kang (The northern end of the former Branch Line) to Yishun. This project was called the Woodlands extension.

3160,25,du6cop6,t3_7x8lts,"I think it's because no other line had an alternative shorter route at the time.*

To go from Orchard to CCK, you'd probably take the EW line. Woodlands is about as far as you'd want to go in many cases.

*The circle line was built specifically as an alt route, and so was the middle bit of the DTL",t3_7x8lts,13-02-2018
3161,25,du6gcb6,t1_du6dtf2,"For those of us old enough to remember when there was only the North, South, East and Marina lines, with 2 central interchange stations, this is the right answer.

When they added the Woodlands line, it was somewhat equal in timing to travel from Bishan to Jurong East via Woodlands or the old route of going via City Hall then west to Jurong East. Thus, any trips from Braddell onwards would actually be faster if you didn't take the direct route.

These days the routes are complicated enough that they have given up on the 'via' parts, I am guessing.",t3_7x8lts,13-02-2018

> SINGAPORE- Another nursing home in Singapore has a confirmed case of Covid-19 infection.

> On Monday (April 13), a 77-year-old male resident of Vanguard Healthcare's Woodlands Care Home (WLCH) at 2 Woodlands Rise was confirmed to be infected with Covid-19.

> The resident, known as Case 2561, tested positive for the infection on Sunday afternoon (April 12), and is now in an isolation room at Khoo Teck Phuat Hospital.

> In a statement, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) said that it was working with the Ministry of Health (MOH) to support WLCH in managing the situation.

> WLCH, which is run by the Government, has conducted a thorough cleaning and disinfection of the resident's ward and affected areas of the home. It has 248 beds in its facility.

> Contact tracing is ongoing and those who had close contact with the resident, including any WLCH staff, will be quarantined.

> In addition to residential services, the home also houses a senior care centre on its premises. The centre provides day care, dementia day care and rehabilitation services to senior citizens in the area.

> AIC said it was designated as a senior care centre that would remain open during the circuit-breaker period of enhanced social distancing measures, to provide care for clients with no alternative arrangements.

> With the confirmed case, the senior care centre has been closed and alternative arrangements have been made for its clients.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> The Straits Times has reached out to AIC and MOH to find out if the rest of the seniors from the home and centre will be tested, isolated or quarantined.

> AIC said that it is working to provide WLCH with manpower support to ensure service continuity, so that residents of the home will not be affected.

> Nursing homes have become hotbeds for Covid-19 infections in many parts of the world.

> Yesterday, Canada's public health office reported that close to half of the 735 deaths in the country so far are linked to long-term care facilities.

> In the United States, 127 out of 163 elderly residents of a nursing home in the state of Virginia have tested positive for Covid-19. 42 of those patients have died.

> In Singapore, Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home was the first home to have a case of Covid-19 infection. It saw an outbreak following the first reported case on April 1, with 16 linked cases and two deaths, both 86-year-old female residents.

> SINGAPORE: A man who was in a stand-off with the police after robbing a woman of her car was sentenced on Thursday (Oct 3) to 15 years' preventive detention, the maximum 24 strokes of the cane and a year's driving ban.

> Preventive detention is a harsh punishment that places a recalcitrant offender in jail for seven to 20 years in order to protect the public from the offender, and there is no reduction of the sentence for good behaviour.

> Advertisement

> Chew Guan Mong, 45, had pleaded guilty to 16 charges including armed robbery, drug-related offences and traffic violations, with another 25 charges taken into consideration for sentencing.

> The incident that wound up in the stand-off began on the afternoon of Jan 5, 2018.

> Chew, who had earlier been banned from driving for 30 years, side-swiped a bus and crashed his vehicle into railings and a wall before abandoning the vehicle and running away.

> He then wrested control of a Mazda 6 from a woman along a slip road merging into Upper Bukit Timah Road, brandishing a sickle at her, and drove off to Woodlands Checkpoint.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He entered the motorcycle lane by accident and was stuck there with the narrowing road, and later crashed through a traffic control barrier and damaged the vehicle such that it could no longer be driven.

> When confronted by police and other officers, Chew alighted the vehicle and brandished his sickle at them.

> Other than the offences committed in this incident, Chew also admitted to being involved in three loan shark harassment cases, possessing a knuckle-duster and a flick knife, and consuming methamphetamine.

> He was also involved in the handling of S$80,000 which was the ransom for a kidnapping orchestrated by criminals in Malaysia.

> 

> Defence lawyer Josephus Tan had called for 13 years' preventive detention to be imposed, along with 24 strokes of the cane.

> This was two years fewer than what the prosecution asked for.

> DEVASTATED BY PREGNANT WIFE'S ARREST, HE TRIED TO SET HIMSELF ON FIRE

> Mr Tan argued that his client was ""largely labouring under drug misuse"" and was ""devastated"" by his pregnant wife's arrest. He had prepared to set himself on fire on the day of the stand-off and was not in ""the clearest of mind"".

> The defence counsel said this was the first time Chew's offences involved drugs, and said he had been informed by a police officer that his wife had been arrested for allegedly being his accomplice in loan shark harassment.

> ""He was utterly devastated,"" said Mr Tan. ""This was when Chew gave up on life, on himself, and went on to commit 17 offences all in the single fateful day of Jan 5, 2018.""

> He added that Chew had doused himself with kerosene just minutes before his arrest near Woodlands Checkpoint, and had tried to set himself on fire.

> ""This was the extent of his despair and sense of hopeless in his drug-influenced state,"" said Mr Tan, who represented Chew along with his colleague Cory Wong from Invictus Law.

> The judge had called for a preventive report to be prepared, which found that Chew's risk of violent re-offending was high.

> 

> He had multiple convictions over the years, beginning with robbery and rioting when he was 18. After this, he continued to steal vehicles, breaking into houses and had previously been sentenced to corrective training.

This limits the places these buses can go to, not to mention that due to the reduced stiffness of the buses making for uncomfortable rides... 

That, and largely due phasing in of new buses, I suppose.",t3_8klmhe,19-05-2018
3335,25,dz8oagr,t3_8klmhe,"Few possible reasons:

As some people have pointed out Bendy buses are being phased out islandwide mostly due to it being not very wheelchair friendly (albeit the newest model is) and it has about the capacity as a double decker but takes up more space which makes double-deckers ideal for SG.

Also, bendy buses take up the whole bus stop while 2 regular length buses can load/unload passengers simultaneously.

However, it takes time to go up a deck and down double-deckers, and if you are gonna take the bus for only 5-10 mins why would you bother going up? Most feeder services have commuters that are there for only 15 mins at most so ppl may not want to go up so as to alight faster and double-deckers have a longer alighting time on average. Hence, why double-deckers are found only on feeder services while longer trunk routes do not face this issue.

Why does only Woodlands have bendy buses though? Have no idea but possibly SMRT (SBS never really had much bendy buses) probably thinks that the Woodlands depot is capable of servicing bendy buses and it may not be in their favour to stop maintenance facilities catered to bendy buses.",t3_8klmhe,19-05-2018
3336,25,dz9ma6j,t3_8klmhe,"Bendy buses used to be TIBS/SMRT buses only fleet of high capacity buses, that‚Äôs why the routes you mentioned have/had bendy buses previously. 

However rumours are that LTA was not too keen on having bendy buses due to the amount of space it takes up on the roads and depot (2 bendy bus = 3 regular 12m bus), and most depots are not built to support bendy buses. So there was a ‚Äúrule‚Äù of a 1 to 1 replacement for bendy buses (aka 1 old bendy bus must be scrapped so that they can buy 1 new bendy bus), resulting in the purchase of 40 new bendy buses after the first 40 bendy buses were scrapped.

But after that there are no more new bendy buses because LTA took over the responsibilites of buying new buses and the rest of the older bendy buses that are scrapped are being replaced with double deckers. 

For now you can find bendies on Woodlands and Yishun feeder services because bendy buses are really good at turning over passengers fast compared to double deckers, but have low seating capacity so that‚Äôs why you rarely see them on routes to the city today. ",t3_8klmhe,20-05-2018

3343,25,dz9i9od,t1_dz8oagr,"Didn't the government take the routes away from they where they used these buses?

Another advantage if bendy buses is their speed. They move much faster than double-deckers. Travelling times for the individual traveller increases. Singapore made the mistake not allowing boarding bendy-buses on all three doors. Singapore will see the difference when the 'new' buses with three doors will arrive. Singapore's public transport is here at least 40 years behind Europe but still make the same mistakes they did those days.

> Currently, vehicles leaving Singapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint have to pay between S$1.90 to S$7.70. This will be decreased to between S$0.50 and S$2.00.

> An eight-year-old girl who is in intensive care after being flung out of a van during an accident in Woodlands last Friday is still in a coma, her father told the media yesterday morning.

> The 45-year-old man, who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan, told Chinese-language newspapers Shin Min Daily News and Lianhe Wanbaothat the next one to two days will be critical in his daughter's recovery.

> The girl was one of four people taken to hospital after an accident involving a van and a red Audi car on Woodlands Avenue 12 towards Seletar Expressway last Friday evening.

> The police said they were alerted to the incident at about 8.10pm, and three van passengers, aged between eight and 27 years old, and a 32-year-old male car passenger were conscious when taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.

> The van driver, a 56-year-old man, was arrested for dangerous driving causing hurt. Police investigations are ongoing.

> In-car camera footage from another car showing the crash, and videos from other drivers of its aftermath, were posted on social media over the weekend.

> The videos show the red Audi travelling on the right of the two-lane road before it collides with the van, which was making a U-turn.

> The impact sent both vehicles spinning and at least two people are seen being flung out of the van, which mounts a kerb.

> Mr Tan said his daughter needed emergency surgery at 4am after she was hospitalised, and she was later transferred to the intensive care unit at KK Women's and Children's Hospital.

> Apart from her head injury, the girl also fractured both her legs, with the wound on her right leg so deep that the bone was exposed

> BROTHER -IN-LAW

> Mr Tan also revealed that the van driver who was arrested is his brother-in-law, and his niece, 27, and nephew, 23, were also hurt in the crash.

> The latter needed surgery as he had a ruptured spleen and facial injuries, but is now conscious and expected to be moved to a regular ward.

> The niece, who was in the front passenger seat, was in stable condition and was expected to be discharged yesterday.

> Mr Tan's youngest daughter, six, was also in the van during the accident.

> She is unhurt and is now staying with her aunt.

> Mr Tan told Wanbao his brother-in-law and his family would typically pick up his two girls from school and have dinner.

> At the time of the accident, they had just eaten and were on their way to meet him.

> He said his brother-in-law, who is out on bail, has been constantly asking about his daughter's condition.

> Meanwhile, the Audi driver has not contacted Mr Tan or his family.

> Said Mr Tan: ""No one wanted this accident to happen and my brother-in-law's children were also injured.

> ""I don't blame him at all.""

You clearly don't drive. What kind of vehicle it is doesn't make any difference to its speed when it comes to making a tight U-turn from a standstill. 

You can't just accelerate in the middle of a tight turn or you will lose control, you have to wait until the steering is straight before you can accelerate. The Audi hit the van before it could do that.",t3_ji9dpr,26-10-2020
3403,25,ga5hd14,t1_ga5ac5h,"> You can see the car is coming and with headlights it's almost impossible to miss.

What makes you think he saw it? It's around a bend and crucially, the Audi was speeding so it would have been far away when the van driver decided to go. 

> So what do you do, try to chiong the U-Turn or wait for the oncoming car to pass?

If you walk around a blind corner at the void deck and a jogger running at full speed crashes into you and you both fall down, is it your fault? 

> If you look at the video, the van driver was just waiting for the bus to go pass and didn't double check before he decided to do the U-Turn

It's pretty clear to me the Audi's speed and the bend in the road reduced the visibility for the van driver. 

It is impossible to react in time when someone comes speeding around a corner far above the speed limit that the road was designed for. Speed limits are in place for a reason, to give drivers time to react and stop.",t3_ji9dpr,26-10-2020

The cam driver was more or less at the same speed between seeing the lorry and the junction was at least 6 secs. The van could have seen and stopped.",t3_ji9dpr,26-10-2020
3405,25,ga5hw4d,t1_ga5gr1s,">You clearly don't drive. What kind of vehicle it is doesn't make any difference to its speed when it comes to making a tight U-turn from a standstill. 

This is not a tight uturn.  This has 3 lanes. A tight uturn will be turning into a 2 lane road. Also, most vans are manual vans. There's a big difference between me doing a uturn using a auto and a manual vehicle that has sufficient acceleration to pull you out of the turn.


>You can't just accelerate in the middle of a tight turn or you will lose control

You are to maintain acceleration up to the point of slippage to minimise time for uturn. But skill and vehicular capability will denote what is a safe range to accelerate by. A manual slow moving vehicle with poor accleration would suggest a longer time for the turn
