What are some pressing concerns or topics that would make sense bringing up to her attention? I am going to meet the president and am wondering how I can best make use of this opportunity other than a photo of a lifetime. I am traveling in Europe and working in Switzerland. What should I do with my two-cents?

Help me choose between Katong and Holland Villagio.,11,7qu5xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7qu5xk/first_timer_to_singapore_help_me_choose_between/,31,17-01-2018,"Hello r/Singapore! I'll be living in Singapore temporarily next month. I'll be working on a short term project with a client, so I'll be around for maybe 3 months, definitely not longer than 4. 

I've been looking at room rentals and narrowed it down to 2 locations at similar prices. 

- Holland Village
- Katong (near Roxy Square mall)

Can someone give me the pros/cons of these two places? From what I can gather 

Holland Village Pros: Right next to MRT subway station, decent nightlife scene, quieter neighborhood. 

Katong Pros: More dining options, the beach is 10mins bike ride away

Their cons are basically the opposite of each other. 

My job during the 3-4 months doesn't require me to go down to the client site everyday. Just twice a week for the mandatory Monday & Wednesday meetings and maybe some Fridays. The client office is in Raffles City financial district and from the maps, Katong and Holland Villagio are somewhat equidistant. 

For me, what's important is having good internet (I'm assuming it's all good in Singapore), easy access to biking or running tracks, easy access to wide variety of food, chance of meeting local people, access to live music at bars and a safe neighborhood. 

I don't plan to be cooking much or at all, so only grocery shopping I need to do is for breakfast food like cereal and milk. 

So with what I've shared, am I better off in Katong or the Holland Villagio?

Thanks!

After renovation, Saizeriya sits in its place. The salon was ran by Singaporeans, but they follow Japanese style. Any ideas where the salon moved to?"
