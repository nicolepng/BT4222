One night earlier this month, Ms Serene Chow was rushed to Mount Alvernia Hospital with abdominal pain, only to be told that it was full.

""The nurse called other hospitals and said Mount Elizabeth and Gleneagles, too, were packed,"" recalled Ms Chow. Only Farrer Park Hospital had a bed for her.

""I told her I have never heard of that hospital. Its location sounded ulu (remote in Malay) to me. But my stomach was so painful, I didn't have a choice.""

It was almost midnight when Ms Chow arrived at Farrer Park in an ambulance. A doctor was already waiting at the entrance of the accident and emergency (A&E) department.

The 46-year-old hairstylist told The Sunday Times: ""At other hospitals, it was always patient waiting for doctor, but at Farrer Park, it was doctor waiting for patient.""

She described the stay in glowing terms: experienced doctors, attentive nurses, and very clean equipment and premises. ""I felt very comfortable during my three-day stay there,"" she said.

When Ms Chow returned to work, she told her colleagues and customers about her experience.

""But none of them, except for one, has heard about Farrer Park. Even my insurance agent didn't know about it!"" said Ms Chow.

Three years after it opened, Farrer Park Hospital - Singapore's first ""mediplex"" comprising hospital, hotel, shops and medical centre which cost $800 million and took five years to build - is still alien to most. The hordes of medical tourists it promises to attract with its latest technology and pioneering integrated infrastructure have yet to materialise.

Half its wards are still empty. The A&E department has an almost leisurely air about it, while nearly half of the 189 medical suites to house clinics remain vacant. On most weeks, the hospital gets just 50 to 60 patients.

The reasons cited include its unusual location and its lack of networks. It is also a casualty of the unexpectedly stiff competition for medical tourists from hospitals in Thailand and Malaysia, say analysts.

In 2008, when Farrer Park Hospital was first announced, the Government projected that Singapore would treat one million foreign patients annually by 2012.

Today, the Republic gets just half of that - an estimated 500,000 medical tourists every year.

In a response to The Sunday Times, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) confirmed that it no longer pursues medical tourism ""as a travel strategy"".

On average, medical tourism spend accounted for less than 4 per cent of overall tourism receipts in recent years, said STB's director of trade engagement and market Soo Siew Keong.

Said health economist Phua Kai Hong: ""Our Government did not anticipate the competition from surrounding countries. If we compare ourselves to Thailand and Malaysia, we are too highly priced.

""There will still be rich Indonesians who will come to Singapore to see the doctors they prefer. But the price-sensitive patients would shop around. And if Malaysia and Thailand charge a fraction of the price for the same procedure, why would they choose Singapore?""

## OPENING IN PHASES

In view of the shifting landscape - just three in 10 patients there now are foreigners - Farrer Park Hospital, owned and managed by The Farrer Park Company, said it is taking steps to manage the situation.

For instance, it is slowly opening in phases to keep operating costs low, said the company's chairman, Professor Maurice Choo, in an interview.

Though it has 220 hospital beds, only 90 inpatient beds are now in use. Just half of its 23 beds in the intensive care unit are opened.

For every 30 beds opened, a hospital needs 40 nurses. It takes six months to hire a nurse, said Prof Choo, adding that he would open more beds only when the hospital achieves 70 per cent occupancy for a period of time. It is now at about 60 per cent.

The hospital has a current workforce of about 600 and up to 1,000, including hotel staff. It declines to say what its operating cost is.

Opening up a hospital gradually is not unusual: The 333-bed Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, which started operating in 2012, fully opened its beds only this year.

Such measures have helped to keep Farrer Park Hospital's finances healthy, said Prof Choo, a cardiologist in his late 60s. One of Singapore's first two Nominated Members of Parliament, he was previously chief of the cardiology department at National University Hospital and vice-dean of its medical faculty in the mid-1990s.

Farrer Park is projected to break even next year, after double-digit revenue growth - 70, 40 and 25 per cent - in the past three years, he said, declining to say what the revenue last year was.

Another challenge that Farrer Park faces is that it has no sibling network to lean on. It was started by Prof Choo and a group of like-minded doctors, helped by investments from Indonesian tycoon Low Tuck Kwong. This is unlike other private hospitals that are part of long-established clusters. For instance, a doctor at Mount Elizabeth Hospital can choose to carry out a procedure at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital.

Thus, it would take time for Farrer Park to build its own patient base and gain their confidence, said Prof Choo. He said since the hospital treated its first patient in end-2015, up till last week, 170 bypass heart procedures have been successfully done, with no deaths.

## 'HOSPITAL IN TIMBUKTU'

As for the vacant medical suites, Prof Choo said it is ""up to the doctors"" when they want to open their clinics. While all units have been sold, he said some doctors who are running clinics elsewhere may take time to move to Farrer Park.

This is even though a suite at Farrer Park is cheaper to rent than one at Mount Elizabeth Novena. A 754 sq ft space at Farrer Park is asking for a monthly rent of $3,100, less than half what a 602 sq ft unit at Mount Elizabeth Novena is asking for - $8,800.

Doctors interviewed said that location is key. Dr Tan Chi Chiu, a gastroenterologist with a clinic at Gleneagles Hospital, said it is a key factor in deciding where he would run his clinic.

Whether there is a critical mass of doctors across a good range of specialities is also important.

A health consultant who declined to be named said the location of Farrer Park Hospital could have deterred some doctors.

""It's like a hospital in Timbuktu. No one wants to move there first. Doctors depend on cross-referrals and they would not want to leave their current network at the more mature hospitals,"" he said.

For some, though, fewer patients mean more time for them.

The former head of the National Cancer Centre Singapore, Professor Soo Khee Chee, has been operating his clinic at Farrer Park Medical Centre for the past year.

He told The Sunday Times that he chose Farrer Park for ""a saner private practice without the hectic clamour, thus having more time for patients and their families"".

A more mature hospital like Mount Elizabeth Hospital, under Parkway Pantai, had an average bed occupancy rate of about 65 per cent between 2016 and last year, according to Parkway Pantai.

Rich or poor, everyone will want their dollar's worth, which is why there's competition is something that's not only inevitable but extremely desirable. 

And you're also assuming there's only a fixed amount of medical supplies and labour in Singapore. That's not true. If people are willing to invest in building hospitals, that's the market correcting the lack of supply to cater to the demand. They're expanding the supply of healthcare services.

The free market for the most part is self regulatory. When there's too much competition investors may see no point in investing in a new hospital since the money to be made is not alot compared to the money required to get the business going. 

I'd argue that without private institutions you'd face an even greater shortage of doctors. Doctors already have to serve their MOH bond through NS (if they're male) and in public hospitals. So public hospitals will always be staffed with doctors, while the private sector provide incentive for people to become doctors in the first place. Without the private sector to be the carrot, it's unlikely that people will want to risk 100k++ in school fees over 5 years of studying medicine. 

If you feel that Singapore lacks doctors, the most obvious solutions would be to 1) start more medicine schools 2) import them. 

Think of the consequences if government owned most of the health care sector. 1) to finance all the infrastructure government would have to increase taxes 2) to provide incentives for doctors the government will have to increase wages (workers can always work overseas) and that will increase taxes.

Before I bought this I read through some r/chinaphone posts before I made a choice. A warning: rugged phones = heavy. When I'm outside I'm mostly on my bicycle even before covid due to work so the phone gets mounted on the handlebar and it isn't a concern weight wise. It's the very few times I'm not on my bicycle that the heft of this phone becomes obvious. HTH.",t3_g5zrhw,22-04-2020
