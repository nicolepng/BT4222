Since when has Geylang or Katong (especially Katong) not been considered East? There's friggin East Coast Road.

In any case, what's considered East or West is not necessarily based on how far the location is from geographic centre of the island (or how the Govt draws up regions or MRT stations).

just a spoiler: the last scandal of a black person being racially murdered by police in germany was in 2005. the amount of people killed by the police in germany in the entire year 2019 was 14. assuming you are american, if you really want to prove to the world that your country is great, which it definetly could be, stop being an ignorant clown in full denial of reality.",t3_iu6x3q,17-09-2020

It's definitely capable of growing to close to 8 metres, although such giants are rare. 

The Reticulated Python is one of the snakes that thrives in highly urbanised Singapore, since our urban environment provides plenty of prey - they feed heavily on rats (and stray cats for the larger individuals). They're good swimmers and move about using our network of drains, canals, and sewers, and have been known to accidentally enter people's homes via the toilet bowl (there are a few instances of really unlucky people [getting bitten by pythons](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36394819) while sitting on the toilet). They also live in our parks, gardens, and other patches of greenery. Pythons are nocturnal, which is why you're often more likely to come across a python out and about if you go jogging in the park or along the park connector after dark.

There's a variety of other smaller snake species that can often be found living close to people, hiding in our parks and gardens, or even sometimes accidentally entering buildings.

333,23,dyg7bx1,t1_dyfwdgg,"To add on, if you see a snake in a public area where people might be at risk of being harmed, or if the snake is the one at risk of being harmed by people, it's usually a good idea to contact ACRES. This usually applies if the snake is in someone's home or office, or at a coffee shop, or crossing the road or at a carpark where it might get run over. In such cases, ACRES will send a wildlife rescue team to catch and remove the snake, which also often doubles up as a form of outreach and education for onlookers. For sightings of pythons in canals and drains, ACRES will usually advise people to leave the pythons alone.

I've encountered [spitting cobras](http://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/snakes/equatorial_spitting_cobra.htm), [kraits](http://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/snakes/banded_krait.htm), and [coral snakes](http://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/snakes/blue_malayan_coral_snake.htm) on several occasions, and they usually prefer to retreat if disturbed. Not to say that you should take stupid risks and get too close, but the fact is that for most encounters, the snake opts to flee. Most encounters usually take place while the snake is just passing by or resting. Biting is typically only used if the snake thinks it's in immediate danger - for instance, if the snake is resting on a branch and someone grabs it, or if it's among the leaf litter and it gets stepped on. On several occasions, I was just walking in some park or other green space when I cross paths with a spitting cobra. If I get too close, the cobra senses danger, rears up and spreads its hood as a warning to me to back off. Same with the spitting of venom; even though the venom can be dangerous if it enters your eyes, it's meant to be a warning to stay away. If you persist in disturbing the snake even after the cobra has given you all these warnings, then it's no surprise that you'll get bitten. This is also why many bites take place while people are trying to catch or kill the snake - if it's threatened, being harassed, and has nowhere to go, it will defend itself. In all my spitting cobra encounters, once I've retreated, the cobra thinks the danger has passed, and it'll then lower its hood and slither off.*

Vipers, on the other hand, are a bit more dangerous if you're not familiar with them. They tend to be ambush predators, so they're typically coiled up among vegetation, in shrubs and small trees, where they just sit and wait for prey to pass within striking range. If disturbed, they often prefer to stay still and wait for the danger to pass, but will bite if they're touched. Vipers are sometimes seen right next to trails in our [forests](http://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/snakes/waglers_pit_viper.htm) and [mangroves](http://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/snakes/shore_pit_viper.htm), and even on boardwalk railings, so you do need to be very careful when you're hiking, and watch where you place your hands.

*Do note that this only applies if the cobra is encountered in a green space where there's plenty of vegetation for the cobra to retreat to. If it's in a confined area, especially indoors, or where people are likely to inadvertently disturb the cobra and get bitten, the recommended course of action is to call ACRES to get them to remove it.",t3_8gviyk,04-05-2018

We are land-poor but talent rich. Why not have a different system of representation compared to other countries? We set up every aspect of our society to maximize our advantages and minimize our weaknesses. Why not governance and representation as well?",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
638,23,fkjf7h2,t1_fkjdxdf,"They're both sides of the same coin, inho. And while it does sound good on paper, the current practice is for MPs to be allocated certain neighbourhoods/precincts that they're in charge of, which is not much different from that of running a SMC. It is also quite hard for MPs to cover overlapping areas to ensure well-rounded support for the people, as a single neighbourhood alone consists of multiple families, let alone trying to canvas multiple neighbourhoods at once.

There's also the thorny issue of GRCs being used to ""parachute"" (allegedly) otherwise unelectable newcomers into parliament. Take Dr Koh Poh Koon, for instance. Despite being hailed as the son of Punggol, he did not run again for Punggol East SMC in GE2015. Rather, he campaigned under the AMK GRC team instead, where it was arguably easier to gain admittance into Parliament as compared to campaigning alone in a SMC.

It is therefore my opinion that the concept of GRCs should be relooked at and perhaps amended to be more democratic.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
639,23,fkjhrij,t1_fkjf7h2,"Funny how I look at those aspects as positives rather than negatives. Being able to divide and coalesce responsibilities where appropriate - that’s the strength of group representation. Obviously some tasks are better tackled individually, and some tasks are better tackled collectively. That’s efficiency and we’re bloody efficient if nothing else.

The GRC system being able to bring in high potential but low experience representatives is also a fantastic strength. That’s how we groom young executives in large corporations - bring them into a team to work on big projects they otherwise could never get exposure to on their own, get them to learn from experienced mentors, and eventually fulfill their potential. It’s a fantastic system, compared to young hopefuls being thrust into SMCs with no experience or guidance. Again, it’s efficient, proven and similar to methods employed by tons of extremely successful organizations.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
640,23,fkjj7sp,t1_fkjhrij,"And herein lies the rub. The system benefits incumbents greatly, while simultaneously raising the bar for any team willing to mount a challenge. No offense, but the way you're looking at it reminds me of the mindset of a business executive. Sure, what you're proposing is great from an organisational standpoint, but from a democratic point of view, it is deeply flawed. If we're truly about electing the best team for the job, why is there a huge divide in requirements for both sides? Sure, one could argue that the incoming party would have to prove themselves first and that some measure of safeguards have to be in place. But the current playing field is so skewed that it might as well be a one-sided game of chess.

And last I checked, we're still a democracy, not a one-party centralised dictatorship like China.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020

I think it worked because it was quiet at night, and domestic cats would feel safer to come out from hiding.

For my case, I didn’t dare to call out to her name late at night, so I shook my bunch of keys while patrolling the area. She recognised the sound of my keys and peeked out from hiding in the drain. I’m sure you can try shaking a bag of his favourite treats as well.

They just think they are big enough can do whatever they want. I still think MOE should come up a lesson of how to respect parent. As children grow up they fail to respect their parent. Some children will still listen to teacher than parent. As parent we can't keep nagging at the children they always feel frustrated but they never think we nagging is for their own good. Newsday children are not like our time we will still respect parent. I saw many outside especially secondary school student they can shout n scold the parent. Totally no respect. Anyway hope the girl go home asap and not make her family worries for her.

> One Foodpanda delivery rider recently received a rather perplexing order — at Hougang, even though he was at Bukit Panjang.

> Order pick up 20km away

> Speaking to Mothership, Dylan Chen explained that he rides a bicycle and is typically stationed in the west side of Singapore.

> He was however, ""unfortunate"" enough to be selected by Foodpanda to do a ""cycling marathon"".

> Chen received an order of fish soup that he had to deliver to a customer at Bukit Panjang Ring Rd.

> However the food was to be picked up at Hougang Ave 4, roughly 20km away from his location.

> The app stated that he would earn S$5 from the assignment.

> Chen then tried to contact Foodpanda's customer service.

> After apologising for the inconvenience caused, the customer service staff stated that Chen would have to carry out the order as he had already accepted it.

> This is despite the fact that Chen revealed he was riding a bicycle.

> The staff continued to insist that it was part of standard operating procedure.

> Chen said that following this exchange, the chat was closed.

> Left with no choice, he decided to re-dispatch the order on the chance that other riders nearer to Hougang would pick up the order.

> This he said, caused the customer to ""wait till no end"", and also impacted his record with Foodpanda.

> Chen said that riders who re-dispatch their orders can have their Batch level affected. Batches will determine riders' shift bookings, among other things.

> He also believes that she did not end up receiving her order.

> Thankfully though, he said that his Batch level was not affected after this incident.

> Mothership has reached out to Foodpanda for more information, and will update the story when they reply.

You have to restart/go offline/online if you're not getting anything tho

Ever since FP opened up more shifts and dropped earnings as you said, it's not worth the time. While Grab has a lot more riders in comparison, the bar for getting incentives is much lower compared to FP and you have a 10% buffer for acceptance/cancellation respectively, so there's more room for error compared to FP, where we're not even allowed to make 1 mistake and have to hit over a certain number of relative hours to hit Batch 1

> Yes, a tortoise.

> The tortoise was in the middle of the road

> The video was taken by a car approaching travelling along the road and it captured the scene of the tortoise walking across the road slowly.

> The motorcyclist could be seen walking from his parked motorcycle, towards the tortoise, and signaling another car to stop.

> Thankfully, the car was accommodating, and waited the entire time while the motorcyclist approached the tortoise.

> The motorcyclist then used a long object to quickly give the tortoise a little push, allowing it to cross the street more quickly.

> Thankfully, the tortoise didn't appear to resist, and went along with it.

> So why did the tortoise cross the street?

> To get to the other side (with some help), apparently.

> Advertisement

> An HDB flat unit in Block 454 Fajar Road was raided by CNB officiers on Sep. 11 afternoon.

> Seven of the arrested suspects were youths aged 13 to 18, while the only adult arrested was a 38-year-old Singaporean female.

> Flat occupants in drug party tried to escape

> Two of the occupants of the flat tried to evade arrest by climbing out of the unit, onto the air-conditioner ledge.

> According to CNB, they eventually gave up and retreated to the unit.

> The CNB officers had given repeated warnings and orders to the occupants to give them access to the flat, before one occupant eventually complied and opened the door to the unit.

> Advertisement

> After the arrest, officers also recovered a small packet of “Ice”, a cut straw, two syringes, three lighters and a lighter refiller that were thrown out of the unit before the raid and landed on the grass patch below the block.

> Preliminary investigations also showed that one of the suspects, a 17-year-old male foreign national, had invited four of the suspects present.

> One of the four invited suspects, a 16-year-old local female, brought along three others, which included her 13-year-old brother and 38-year-old biological mother.

> Further investigations are still currently ongoing.

> Separate drug raid involving young children

> Separately, a suspected drug-offending couple was also arrested by CNB officers during a Sep. 2 island-wide operation, in a HDB unit near Edgefield Walk.

> Advertisement

> The Singaporean couple, a 33-year-old male and 28-year-old female, have four children.

> Three of them, aged 3 months, 19 months and 6 years, were present during the drug raid conducted by CNB officers.

> A family in Bukit Panjang has been ordered by the court to vacate their HDB flat unit for being noisy neighbours, The Straits Times (ST) reported on Jan. 5, 2020.

> Advertisement

> The Exclusion Order, which was issued by the Community Dispute Resolution Tribunal (CDRT), came into effect on Jan. 6 and will last till Feb. 6.

> It is the first Exclusion Order to be issued, and comes after the flat’s occupants breached an earlier court order to keep their noise levels down, ST added.

> Although the order was directed at Low Bok Siong and his other half, Iwa, the couple’s two grown children will have to leave the flat as well.

> Upstairs neighbour affected

> The order was set in motion by the family’s neighbour upstairs, 29-year-old Daniel See.

> See could not live in peace due to the noise disturbance created by the family.

> According to ST, the dispute started in November 2017, when See called the police on Iwa after witnessing her hitting the staircase railing with a metal rod.

> See believes that the family has been unhappy with him since, and made excessive noise targeted at him for the past two years.

> This includes hammering and playing loud music, ST said.

> Advertisement

> The Low family went to the extent of leaving one bedroom unoccupied at night, so that they could blast the music directly underneath See’s bedroom.

> This resulted in three adults sleeping in one bedroom, with their heads in blankets, while the fourth member of the family slept in the living room.

> See had previously sought help from the police, the town council, the Housing Development Board (HDB), and his MP, but it did not work.

> ST wrote that he finally filed a complaint with the tribunal in June 2018.

> Since then, it’s been bureaucracies and investigations, finally leading to the Exclusion Order which See pasted on Low’s doors on Jan. 4.

> Low’s family not intending to comply

> In a follow-up report on Jan. 7, ST revealed that the the Low family do not intend to comply with the Exclusion Order.

> Instead, they will be hiring a lawyer to appeal against it.

> As of Jan. 6, the family has yet to move out.

> Advertisement

> If the Exclusion Order does not work, See will have to file a Magistrate’s Complaint to enforce it under the Community Dispute Resolution Act (CDRA).

> Low and his family will each be fined up to S$5,000, imprisoned for up to three months or both, if convicted.

> But that will take more time and energy on See’s part, with uncertain results.

> According to ST, See intends to file the complaint, as he said he “can’t be giving up” after coming this far.

I haven’t heard/read much about the rest of the members of SDP nor the other opposition parties so I’m just saying this as a sweeping statement:

I really do think it’s high time all the opposition parties take a leaf from WP’s book and rebrand themselves over the next decade or so, to give themselves more credibility and trustworthiness, as opposed to (pun-intended) just “opposing for the sake of opposing”. 

If they are unable to do so, and/or unable to attract talents who can, then perhaps it might be better to leave the job to WP so as to have a higher chance of having a more balanced parliament. Aside from Nicole Seah’s time with NSP (yay that she has finally joined WP), most of the non-WP opposition parties have thus far been fielding candidates who haven’t been too memorable and may be better off remaining as grassroots leaders/volunteers.

Oftentimes, people end up voting PAP in cos the candidate on the other side is just too cui to want as an MP and/or their statements don’t hold water.

EDIT (to add that): But well, one good thing this GE is that the opposition parties have finally learnt to talk more with each other and stop the “three-way-fights” which only result in dividing the opposition votes and giving PAP guaranteed wins.

UPDATE: After all the nominations got in today, there are still three-cornered fights after all: Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC and Pioneer SMC. The latter had supposedly been avoided after talks between the interested opposition parties but a “surprise” independent candidate entered the race zzz 😓 (https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ge2020-pasir-ris-punggol-grc-pioneer-smc-set-three-cornered-fights)",t3_hilnb9,30-06-2020

The rest of Bt Panjang and Zhenghua are older flats where most of the residents are middle-aged/elderly, some of whom have lived here over 30 years since they were moved out of the old Zhenghua kampung before that.

> SINGAPORE - About $60 million a year in public funds goes towards subsidising operations for a stretch of the MRT Downtown Line (DTL) connecting Bukit Panjang to the city, Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Friday (Aug 7).

> He revealed this figure in response to a Bukit Panjang resident who had submitted a petition with more than 2,000 names asking the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to rescind its plans to remove some bus services from the area and change the routes of others.

> In an e-mail reply obtained by The Straits Times, Mr Ong noted that the Government built the DTL - which runs from Bukit Panjang to Expo in the east - at a cost of $21 billion.

> ""It is not a profitable line, so the Government uses public funds to subsidise the running of the line, and operation subsidy comes up to over $60 million a year for the DTL stretch connecting Bukit Panjang to the city,"" he said.

> At the same time, ridership on bus services that run parallel to the DTL has fallen significantly, he said.

> For service 171, which will see its route changed, ridership fell by over 30 per cent from 2015 to 2019. For service 700, which will be removed, it was more than a 50 per cent drop in the same period.

> He said services 171 and 700 are also being subsidised, costing taxpayers $14 million a year.

> ""If the bus services are the only public transport option available to residents, LTA is able to justify the public spending,"" he said. ""But with the DTL available, LTA needs to exercise prudence in public spending, and is hence making the changes announced.""

> Mr Ong told the resident that he fully understood the concerns about service 972 - which has been amended to ply Dunearn Road - having more stops, and service 190 being more crowded after the change.

> ""I have asked LTA to look into this, and they should be prepared to inject more buses if necessary,"" he added. ""LTA will engage the grassroots adviser, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, and hear out residents for mitigating measures.""

> He added: ""We seek the understanding of residents as we work through these changes, and strike a balance between the needs of various groups of commuters and financial prudence.""

> Related Story New Sungei Kadut MRT station linking North-South and Downtown lines could shorten trips by 30 mins

> The same $60 million subsidy figure for the DTL was cited by Senior Minister of State for Transport Chee Hong Tat in a Facebook post on Friday evening.

> Mr Chee said he would be meeting MPs Liang Eng Hwa and Edward Chia on Saturday with LTA representatives to discuss the issue.

> Mr Liang previously said he is aware of the ridership drop, but called for a ""compromise solution"" which does not call for the removal of services.

> SBS Transit, a subsidiary of transport giant ComfortDelGro, beat rival SMRT to land the DTL contract with a bid of about $1.6 billion over 19 years from 2013. Annualised, the licence charge works out to be around $84.2 million a year.

> Asked why taxpayers were subsidising the running of a line which a private company had undertaken to operate in a competitive tender, the LTA said the sum was necessary to make up for a shortfall in funds necessary for the eventual asset replacement of the line.

> ""Under the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF), the operator pays the Government a licence charge for the use of operating assets, such as trains and signalling system. This goes towards their eventual replacement and renewal,"" an LTA spokesman said.

> ""As the DTL is not a profitable line, the licence charge paid by SBST is insufficient to cover the annual depreciation, and hence the eventual replacement of the DTL operating assets.

> ""The difference between the annual depreciation and licence charge paid is the Government's subsidy for DTL operations. This comes up to about $60 million a year for the DTL stretch connecting Bukit Panjang to the city.""

> The DTL is the first line operated under the NRFF, where the Government owns all fixed and operating assets, and the operator focuses on maintenance and meeting service standards.

> Unlike the bus contracting system, the government does not assume revenue risk in the NRFF.

> SBS Transit had said that ridership had been lower than projected, but analysts were expecting the line to break even this year. This expectation however was made before the pandemic.

> Public transport ridership is at around half the volume it was before the Covid-19 crisis.

> Commenting on the $60 million subsidy, Singapore University of Social Sciences transport economist Walter Theseira called for more transparency on rail funding.

> ""We know that on a systemwide basis, operating costs are now subsidised for rail but there is little information put out about the basis for these calculations, where subsidies are going, to whom, et cetera,"" he said.

> Dr Theseira added that in the case of the DTL, ""we should be open"" about how the revenue shortfall came out.

> ""We can accept that it is necessary to rescue a commercial operator which made a mistake in bidding - especially if factors that caused the financial distress are beyond an operator's control - but we don't know how exactly it came about and to what extent it is beyond operator control,"" said the former nominated MP.

> ""We are not having a discussion about the right questions in public transport contracting and financing.""

1012,23,g0s9n7j,t1_g0rzjeo,"According to LTA (old information in 2012)
>	Just to give context to the $1.1 billion the cost for a new bus is about $500,000,while the daily operational cost of a bus is about $600 based on existing bus fleet data.

A trip from Bukit Panjang to Orchard cost $1.60 according to gothere.sg. This means every bus on average must carry 375 passengers a day. If the demand is so bad that most of service 700’s 17 buses run empty outside of peak hours, it will pull down the average below that, and it will not break even. 

To give you context, the capacity of Mercedez-benz OC500LE which service 700 uses can only carry 90 passengers. To break even and pay the operation costs, *every one* of that 17 buses must carry 4 *full load* a day.

It cost $4.2 million a year to buy, maintain, and run 17 buses *back in 2012*.

Now consider this. The $600/day/bus figure was in 2012, based on the cost to maintain buses back then. Also remember that back then, SMRT’s cost cutting on maintenance doesn’t stop at MRT, and their buses used to be quite badly maintained. The costs today, plus rising wages, plus more maintenance engineers and technicians, could push that figure up. 

Also consider this. Service 700 only uses a fleet of single decker bus, and it has a 10 min frequency for the bulk of its operating hours. What this imply is that its demand is already poor (you don’t use *only* single deckers for popular service). 

Couple that with a *50%* reduction in ridership since DTL opened, you are looking at very low ridership and yet you cannot cut the bus supply further (you can’t double the frequency to match, because 20 mins frequency will still get LTA into trouble with those BP residents, and you can’t downsize the bus used any further).

It is entirely possible that operating costs had increased greatly, coupled with falling ridership, to result in it costing $7 million or more a year.

Now, can you justify $7 million a year to just simply link Petir Road to Orchard directly without transfers or walking to another nearby(?) bus stop that has an alternative?",t3_i5wqhf,08-08-2020

1044,23,g0v0mps,t1_g0ufgvi,"I would still think that it is similar to extrapolate from the $600/day/bus figure. 

I went to find the spec sheets of bus engines and it seems like that isn’t a big difference between the fuel consumption of a single decker vs double decker (not an engineer, might not read the fuel consumption curve correctly). TBH, the MAN brand single decker and double decker uses the same engine...

If fuel costs are the bulk of operational costs and if the fuel consumption isn’t greatly different between SD and DD buses, then it probably doesn’t matter too much. 

Since 400 only has 3 buses, it costs probably around $750,000/year in 2012 to serve a “critical” function of linking Marina Barrage to Marina Bay MRT. Could be about $1-2 million a year nowadays (to get the $7m figure for svc 700, we need to multiply it by 2, so perhaps we can extrapolate the same for svc 400), if there’s totally no demand, although there no new data to tell though.

Since OYK did say that they are okay with paying if its actually *critical/vital* to service an area, I think svc 400 is still somewhat reasonable (at least until TEL opens).

The thing about svc 700 is that it is not critical. Its not like removing svc 700 will mean people in BP cannot go to town reasonably quickly enough. Using figures quoted from the same site to compare, it takes 23 mins (excluding waiting time) of travel time to take bus from Petir Road to DTL to NSL to Orchard. Svc 700 does so in 17 mins (excl. waiting). For some, they can walk to another bus stop nearby (+5 mins walk) for a bus that has only has 13 mins of travel time (excl. waiting).

Compared to spending maybe up to $2 million/year to service a tourist location that isn’t otherwise served, spending $7 million/year to save 15 mins of extra walking/waiting just don’t seem as justifiable. If there’s 1500 residents using svc 700 daily (enough to pack all 17 buses fully twice a day), its still the equivalent of paying $4500/person/year (or $375/person/month) *to save 15 mins*.

If DTL is simply merely just crowded must stand and cramp a bit in cabin, that is hardly a complaint, come on. Bukit Panjang being the first station should make it reasonably easy to board. Squeeze a bit la, what is that compared to NSL’s face-on-door kind of sardine.

Worse still, northern towns on NSL has no quick trunk bus routes to town taking advantage of expressways, like BP/CCK with 190. At least people in BP still have *some* choices to avoid packing like sardine on MRT.

Anyway, a 6 car NSL train is equivalent to ~12 double deckers. A 3 car DTL train is therefore equivalent to ~6 double deckers. Given peak frequency of even let’s say conservatively at 3 mins intervals, you need those removed/cut bus services (700 and 171) to supply a lot more passengers to be impactful on DTL crowding! Service 171 has a peak frequency of 10 mins, service 700 has a peak frequency of 4 mins. 171 has DD, 700 does not (all single deckers according to some online deployment reference).

Effectively, the interval would be 12 mins (either you don’t board the early terminating train or you board and wait for another 6 mins again).

A good strategy for such “special” trains would be to avoid unless it also brings you to your destination (ie, if you stay in Woodlands, simply avoid it). If everyone alight at Yishun/AMK and wait for the next train, there is a chance you won’t be able to board (plus no aircon).

Also, I am guessing some of these cases are also linked to some of the dorms (on the newly identified day), which is why there is not a noticeable ""missing/shortfall"" of cases.

I'm not so sure about that. They specially went to swab, and I think do blood tests, on 3700 bus interchange-related people. Most or all of the 89 PCR-negative, antibody-positive people probably never got swabbed back when they would actually have been positive.

And unless there is at least 1 new case linked to that cluster, that cluster is not reported in Annex B, and the total number of cases linked to that cluster remains ""not reported/ unknown"".

> After the large numbers of Asian openbills that visited at the end of 2019, Singapore has yet another rare wildlife visitor.

> Advertisement

> Following the last sighting of a pair of Himalayan Griffon vultures at Bukit Timah, the birdwatchers were alerted to a surprising sighting of them again this week.

> In the early morning of Jan. 9, 2020, a number of Himalayan Griffon vultures have been spotted flying around several places near town.

> S’pore a pitstop for the vultures

> Himalayan Griffon vultures hail, as evident from their name, from the high altitudes of the Himalayas and mountains of Central Asia.

> They are the second-largest Old World vultures found in the continents of Europe, Asia and Africa — their wingspan can reach up to three metres.

> The species is currently classified as “near threatened” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

> The Himalayan Griffon vultures have been spotted during the months of December and January in Singapore in some years, according to Singapore Birds Project.

> These birds are here to find food to refuel and rest as they migrate down to the south during winter.

> As a result of the long flight, the vultures usually arrive weak and hungry.

> Advertisement

> Spotted at many places around Singapore

> The large birds were seen congregating in several areas including Outram Hill, Berlayer Creek, near the Singapore General Hospital, Raffles Place, Bukit Panjang and even Sentosa.

> People in Tanjong Pagar: at least 3 Himalayan Vultures (very rare occasional visitors to Singapore) have been spotted in the vicinity of Orchid Hotel. If you see some really big birds flying high up, it's probably them. Also, be prepared for the crowd of photographers. — Ivan Kwan (@hai_ren) January 9, 2020

> A birdwatcher told Mothership that he believed there were around 12 vultures spotted together at one point.

> The sighting was described by veteran birdwatcher, Francis Yap, as “unprecedented”, as the vultures are rare migrants and for the first time, such a large number of them has been recorded.

> Here’s a really cool shot of the magnificent Himalayan Griffon vulture soaring near the [email protected], taken by Yap.

> At one time, four of the vultures were found roosting in the central business district area.

> A few photos show the large bird roosting atop Orchid Hotel near Tanjong Pagar.

> One person even spotted a vulture wandering along Peck Seah Street towards Maxwell Road on Jan. 8, at around 7pm.

1207,23,dvdpapb,t1_dvcofct,"Sorry, I was afk for most of today.

Identifying raptors is not one of my strongest areas, but yes, I think this is most likely an adult Crested Goshawk. Many raptors can be very difficult to tell apart, and the accipiters (sparrowhawks and goshawks) can all look very similar.

I consulted my copy of the New Holland Field Guide to the Birds of South-East Asia (a very useful resource to learn how to identify birds in this region, if a little out of date). For me, what makes me lean towards Crested Goshawk are the following characteristics:

1) Yellow eyes (not reddish like male Chinese and Japanese Sparrowhawks)

2) Black streak down the throat (lacking in Chinese and Eurasian Sparrowhawks)

3) Relatively thick tarsus - this sets the Crested Goshawk apart from the other accipiters, which have much skinnier legs

4) Thick bands on the tail feathers; once again, this sets the Crested Goshawk apart from the other accipiters, which have narrower bands on the tail feathers.

In terms of which of the accipiters are more common in Singapore (and hence more likely to be encountered by random people who aren't specifically out birdwatching), the Japanese Sparrowhawk is our most common winter visitor. Crested Goshawk is considered an uncommon resident, but based on recent nesting records, seems to be starting to breed in our urban green spaces. Chinese Sparrowhawk is uncommon as well, visiting in smaller numbers than the Japanese Sparrowhawk. So I'd say that these are the 3 most likely accipiters you'll encounter. As for Besra and Eurasian Sparrowhawk, the number of confirmed records of each species in Singapore can be counted on one hand.

Besides accipiters, you might also encounter other birds of prey in urban areas, like the Oriental Honey Buzzard, White-bellied Sea Eagle, Brahminy Kite, and Changeable Hawk-eagle.

> SINGAPORE - Two NTUC FairPrice supermarkets in Bukit Panjang and a market and hawker centre in Jurong West have been added to a list of public places visited by Covid-19 patients.

> The Ministry of Health added these three spots to the four locations on the list that was first provided on Monday (May 25).

> The ministry said the list of locations where Covid-19 patients visited for more than 30 minutes is being given as a precautionary measure to inform those who were at these locations to monitor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit. They should see a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms.

> On May 17, an active Covid-19 case was at the Jurong West Market and Food Centre at Block 505 Jurong West Street 52, from 9am to 9.30am. An active case was also at the same location on May 25, from 11am to noon.

> A community case who was infectious was at the FairPrice outlet in Hillion Mall on May 24, from 12.30pm to 1pm, while on the same day, an active case was also at the FairPrice Finest outlet in Bukit Panjang Plaza from noon to 12.30pm.

> On Wednesday, there were 533 new coronavirus cases.

> Of these, four were community cases: three Singaporeans and one work pass holder from China.

> Two of the Singaporean cases are asymptomatic and have been linked to the cluster at Jurong Penjuru dormitory. The third Singaporean, a 56-year-old woman, is currently unlinked.

> The work pass holder is a 33-year-old man who had gone to work at 19 Pandan Road, Tuas Terminal Phase 1 and Jurong Port recently.

> The remaining 529 cases were migrant workers staying in dormitories.

> With 832 new cases discharged on Wednesday, a total of 17,267 patients have fully recovered from the disease, or 53 per cent of the 32,876 Covid-19 patients here.

> As of Tuesday, 525 remain in hospital, including seven in the intensive care unit. A total of 15,052 are in community facilities.

> A new cluster was announced at a dormitory at 38 Tuas View Square, which now has five cases. It is the first cluster announced after three successive days where no new clusters were detected.

> The average number of new daily community cases has risen in recent days, with the ministry attributing it partly to active surveillance and screening of nursing home residents and pre-school staff.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> This has increased from five two weeks ago to six in the past week, while the number of unlinked community cases has also increased from one per day to two in the same period.

> Twenty-three people have died from Covid-19 complications in Singapore, while nine who tested positive have died from other causes.

> Globally, the outbreak, which began in December last year, has infected more than 5.67 million people. Some 352,000 have died.

1243,23,fxmb1un,t3_hp594s,"Bukit Panjang: Dr. Teo Ho Pin has been a really popular MP for this district since 1997. There is a reason why he was dubbed as the ""Auntie Killer"".


In terms of what Mr. Liang did for Bukit Panjang, he improved the infrastructure in Bukit Panjang in general as he was the MP for Zhenghua, the neighboring district, which is considered a part of Bukit Panjang Town. He has lobbied for new bus services, mainly service no. 972, which is one of the most used bus services in Bukit Panjang to connect BP to the downtown area. If Dr. Paul did not contest here, you will see results around the 35% mark like other SDP contested wards.


Bukit Panjang can be considered as a mature estate, being more than 30 years old. The newer parts of Bukit Panjang have been drawn into Holland-Bukit Timah. Therefore, it will always be a tough fight, not like newer districts like Sengkang who has a higher amount of younger voters which might swing the election, or Aljunied and Hougang where WP has a good track record in running the TCs.



A close to 15% vote swing is a respectable result for SDP, coming from where it was in 2015. Even Dr. Paul recognised that it will be a miracle if they were to win. Look at the results since 2006: 22.82 -> 33.73 -> 31.62 (islandwide swing to PAP) -> 46.26.",t3_hp594s,11-07-2020

I think the past image of Dr Chee still lingers amongst voters, especially the older ones. There’s still more Merdeka generation and 50s here as I’ve observed. Though I won’t be in this constituency in the next GE, wish Dr Chee all the best if he still decides to contest.

EDIT: btw, both candidates did not do any house visit for my area/block in this GE. I’ve stayed here for almost four years. Whether that’s a dealbreaker, I won’t know. But considering Dr Chee’s image, I am more inclined that doing a house visit will do him more good than harm. Take the opportunity to speak and change their opinion on him.

As someone who voted for Murali,

My family has benefited from Murali's assistance before. Everyone likes to highlight the accidents and call him a MIA MP here but to me he's done his part in making our lives better. You can check my post history for the long story, but it was an incident with my grandmother.

I will never condone CSJ's actions of badmouthing Singapore to foreign liberal media for brownie points. In a game where its supposed to be SG vs the world, he's proven that his ego is far more important that anything else. I'm willing to give chances to new candidates if they fuck up their first pr incident like TPL in the past and Raeesah from this election, no matter how much I disagree with them, but CSJ has been here for so long and he still repeats the same destructive garbage every election. His previous incident with CST also sits sourly with me, as I really respected CST as an opposition old guard. For CSJ who has had a record of belligerent behaviour, I can only interpret his current actions as the leopard knowing how to hide his spots. One less day with CSJ as an MP, one more day with a proper parliament. Might not even matter if he gets NMP though. Hope TCB's team takes the offer.

Again, try not to downvote, call me ignorant, say that I don't use social media, only watch CNA or any of the usual drivel. You'd think CSJ was some saint if you used reddit as your only info source. He decidedly isn't and honestly, he's only dragging Dr. Tambyah down.",t3_hp594s,11-07-2020

Chiam See Tong had a very good reputation and he had a lot of respect among the 老百姓. So the betrayal by CSJ stung a lot of people whom were ordinary voters.

I distrusted Chee Soon Juan, disliked SDP's policy on NS, also disagreed on the rare few statements CSJ made on foreign policy but liked everything else about SDP's manifesto.

\-gets ushered non stop to finish a meal that they are paying for before the closing time.(who wouldn't be pissed?)

\-police alerted at 9.49pm which might be during or after the fight.

\-ALL these happened before 10pm, which is the closing time of the premise.

&#x200B;

Usually for food establishments that closes around that time, kitchen closes at 9.30pm and customers are advised at  reception beforehand on whether or not it's okay to patronize as the timing cuts close. secondly those establishments usually will have to do cleanup and end-of-day-sales duties after closing which usually takes 30mins - 1 hour. From what I understand the 10PM closing timing is to enable them to fulfill the above-mentioned tasks and generally patrons aren't allowed to enter the premise. 

&#x200B;

However in this case the staff was doing cleaning duties before the shop's closing time, either they wanna hurry home on the dot(which isn't a bad thing tbh) or that's their standard practice and that the mall closes up and locks every exit at 10pm sharp(which i really doubt is the case). So unless the management can come forward to clarify what's the actual practice like, we wouldn't really know why the need for rush was.

\-Girl enters restaurant before 9pm and asked for last order's timing

\-Girl orders alot of food supposedly (should be including her friend's order tgt)

\-Guy friend comes into restaurant at 9.30pm

\-Staff does closing duties at 9.45pm

\-Employee allegedly does remind patrons of establishment's timing and  that if customers weren't able to finish by 10PM, a grace period of 10-15mins would be given.

\-Guy friend wasn't satisfied with staff's colleague(supposedly the dinner??) and further on confronts them on why they were being hustled while the kitchen staff were doing cleanup in the kitchen.

\-Staff explains that they were commuting between JB and SG and wanted to avoid the traffic jam and that they were clocking 12 hours shifts daily. And that the boss wouldn't pay for OT after their proposed hours.

\-Guy friend went nuts and verbally abused them(vulgar language included).

\-Staff's colleague got angry, punched a pillar that was allegedly far from where the patrons were sitting.

\-Guy friend then went up to the colleague who punched the pillar and kicked his leg, then proceeds to throw punches as well.

\-Colleague retaliated in self defense.

\-CCTV captured entire scenario.

\-Police came, guy friend had no identification on him, police told staff that the guy friend was a troublemaker with multiple records of fighting.

Anxiety is not caused by our sense of threat, it is what we add on to it. Allowing the mind to dwell again and again on a worst case scenario makes it come to seem far more likely to occur than the situation warrants. Taking care of our physical health needs to be accompanied by a sincere effort to take care of our mental health. We need to catch ourselves when we get caught up in anxious thoughts and gently but firmly put them down. Again and again. We can motivate ourselves by remembering that anxiety and its associated states of stress and panic weaken our immune system and make us more vulnerable to the very illness that we fear.

Times of threat and uncertainty brings out both the best and worst in human beings. Let us be in the group that rises up to challenges with self-discipline and mindfulness, calm and good humour, with consideration for those around us and compassion for us all.

> SINGAPORE: A series of unpopular changes to bus services in the Bukit Panjang area, which were to come into effect on Sunday (Aug 16), will now be delayed by two weeks while mitigation measures are being introduced.

> The changes will now be introduced on Aug 30 to allow bus operators more time to implement the new measures, which include the provision of a direct bus service to the city, said Senior Minister of State for Transport Chee Hong Tat on Thursday (Aug 13).

> This comes after it was announced earlier this month that services 700 and 700A would cease operations, while service 171 would loop at Bukit Panjang MRT station instead of travelling to the Marina Centre bus terminal.

> From Aug 30, bus service 171 will loop at Bukit Panjang MRT station instead of travelling to the Marina Centre bus terminal. (Photo: Land Transport Guru website/boy_you_want_bus)

> The Land Transport Authority (LTA) had said that the changes were made in light of sharp declines in ridership for the services following the opening of the second phase of the Downtown MRT line in 2017, as well as a need to ""exercise prudence"" in the use of public funds, given the millions subsidising the running of the bus services.

>

> Newly-elected Bukit Panjang MP Liang Eng Hwa had said at the time that he was disappointed with the ""drastic changes"" and that he felt bus route planners had given ""no regard"" to how the changes would impact residents' lives.

> 

> Service 971E, currently a peak-hour express service that bypasses certain bus stops, will be converted to a trunk service, 971, that calls at more stops, said Mr Chee in a Facebook post.

> 

> The service will now ply Petir Road before entering the Bukit Timah Expressway to give residents a direct bus connection to town during peak hours, he added.

> 

> The operating hours for service 971 will also be extended, running from 6.30am to 8.30am in the morning and from 6.05pm to 7.35pm in the evening.

> ""Existing Service 971E commuters will experience an increase in travel times, but their fares will drop by up to 60 cents per trip as they no longer need to pay express fares. They can also alight at more bus stops along the way,"" said Mr Chee.

> 

> The route for service 972 - which would have been changed to serve commuters at Bukit Timah and Dunearn Road as well as those living near Newton MRT and Scotts Road - will also no longer be amended in view of residents' feedback, he added.

> 

> ""Instead, we will introduce a modified Service 972M by redirecting a portion of the existing Service 972 buses to ply along Dunearn Road and Scotts Road. This allows commuters at Dunearn and Bukit Timah Road to retain connectivity to Scotts Road and Newton MRT,"" he stated.

> (Graphic: Facebook/Edward Chia Bing Hui)

> Mr Chee added that additional peak hour trips for services 972 and 972M would be introduced where necessary to reduce waiting time and crowding for commuters.

> 

> Bukit Panjang commuters can take either service 972 or 972M to town, he said, noting also the option of service 971 during peak hours.

> 

> ""While this arrangement increases the headway between bus arrivals for both Services 972 and 972M, commuters can use the bus service app to plan your journeys and minimise waiting time at the bus stops,"" he said, adding that he sought commuters' understanding that some give and take is needed in such situations, to ""cater to different groups of commuters while ensuring prudent use of public funds"".

> 

> ""Lastly, LTA will increase the frequency of Service 973 during peak hours to enhance the connection to Hillview MRT,"" said Mr Chee. ""We will monitor the situation after two months and assess if further adjustments are needed.""

> LTA will increase the frequency of Service 973 during peak hours to enhance the connection to Hillview MRT. (Photo: Land Transport Guru website/boy_you_want_bus)

> Mr Chee said that the mitigation measures come after discussions with Mr Liang, Holland-Bukit Timah GRC MP Edward Chia as well as grassroots leaders.

> 

> In a post on Facebook, Mr Liang said he was glad that they had arrived at solutions based on commuters' feedback.

> 

> ""It has not been easy to find that balance, but our foremost consideration is to minimise the inconveniences and impact to residents, especially to the peak hour commuters,"" he said, thanking Mr Chee for his personal involvement in coming to a ""better solution"".

>

> SINGAPORE — Transport operator SMRT is studying options on the Bukit Panjang LRT (BPLRT) network, such as whether to suspend it during off-peak hours and replace the service with buses, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said on Friday (Aug 30).

> Speaking to rail executives and rank-and-file workers at the SBS Transit (SBST) Sengkang Depot, Mr Khaw said while maintenance across the MRT lines has to be intensified, there are limits for ageing trains.

> “If we are pushing assets till the end of their productive life, the risk of failure is high. So I have been encouraging SMRT to think of ways that, in off-peak periods when the load for the BPLRT is low, if they could serve the same demand quite adequately with buses,” said Mr Khaw, who is also the Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure.

> SMRT is studying this option, he added, though he did not give details on when such an arrangement would be rolled out. After Mr Khaw's speech, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and SMRT, however, told reporters that SMRT was looking at the operational details of the BPLRT, with the possibility of lengthening the waiting times between trains.

> There has been much public discussion over what to do with the BPLRT, with various ideas being bandied about.

> For example, in October 2016, SMRT said in a blog post that several options were being weighed to “completely transform” the LRT line, including scrapping the network and returning to the use of buses — though the LTA had then said the idea was “not likely to be practical”. 

> A month later, in November 2016, Mr Khaw said the system would be overhauled, rather than ditched. 

> Subsequently, in September 2017, Mr Khaw had described the BPLRT system as an “afterthought” that was built under “political pressure”, resulting in a design that makes for uncomfortable rides. “No LRT is designed that way, in such a masochistic manner, where you force yourself up and down, twist and turn,” he had said then, adding that the few occasions he had taken the LRT left him dizzy.

> Renewal works on the ageing line began last year and are expected to take four years to complete, as the BPLRT’s original equipment manufacturer Bombardier upgrades the rail’s parts and ageing fleet of trains which have been in use since 1999. The line is still being operated by SMRT, albeit for fewer hours to accommodate the works.

> In response to TODAY's queries, an LTA spokesperson said that most design works have been completed and installation works have commenced.

> ""For example, commuters may notice antennas for the new Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling system have been installed along the trackside,"" the spokesperson said.

> ""Brand new LRT trains will also be delivered progressively from late 2020. Residents can look forward to more reliable rides from 2022.""

> On Friday, Mr Khaw was speaking at an event to thank the MRT staff from both SMRT and SBST for reaching a milestone of more than 1 million mean kilometres between failure (MKBF) for the entire MRT network in July.

> In his speech, he said that it may be better for commuters living along the BPLRT to take the bus instead of the LRT during off-peak hours, given that the BPLRT assets are nearing the end of their active period.

> By suspending the BPLRT during off-peak hours and offering bus transportation instead, there will be no loss of service to commuters and the risk of failure for the line is lower, said Mr Khaw.

> Bukit Panjang resident Isabelle Kim, 27, said she already takes the bus to get to the Bukit Panjang MRT station on the Downtown Line, as the travel time and comfort of the buses are better than what the LRT provides.

> Recalling a breakdown that happened in 2018, when commuters ended up walking on the tracks, Ms Kim said: “Sometimes, it may even be faster to go on foot instead.”

> This is because the train assets are ageing and pushing them too far now can result in failure.

> Khaw said:

> “The trains are running at almost the end of its productive life, and therefore the risk of failure is higher. At the same time, we must first intensify maintenance, but there are limits when we are pushing assets to the end of its productive life.”

> BPLRT’s original equipment manufacturer Bombardier is currently conducting renewal works on the entire system right now.

> It is expected to take four years to complete.

> Advertisement

> The renewal involves upgrading the rail parts and bringing in a new fleet of trains.

> The current fleet of trains has been serving the BPLRT system for 20 years.

> As an alternative, Khaw suggests that commuters can take buses instead during the off-peak hours, thus lowering the stress on the BPLRT trains and preventing any loss of service to commuters.

> Separately, at the same event, Khaw announced that as of July 2019, Singapore’s MRT network clocked over 1 million kilometres between delays.

> SINGAPORE - A new underpass that will give residents in nearby HDB blocks sheltered access to Bukit Panjang MRT station will open in the first quarter of 2018 after a delay of more than a year.

> The 100m linkway, which will serve as the third entrance to Bukit Panjang MRT station, was slated at first to open in December 2016 but was pushed back due to construction challenges.

> Giving an update to The Straits Times last month, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said architectural works for the project have been completed.

> Electrical and mechanical works have also been finished, it added, and will soon undergo testing.

> ""When it is completed, residents at Senja Road will be able to access the Bukit Panjang MRT station directly instead of via the junction of Bukit Panjang Road and Woodlands Road,"" said an LTA spokesman.

> Bukit Panjang is the western terminus of Downtown Line 2 (DTL2), which opened in December 2015.

> When the line was designed and built, only two entrances to the station were planned.

> But the authorities gave the nod for a third entrance in 2013, after lobbying by Holland-Bukit Timah GRC residents and the GRC&apos;s MPs Liang Eng Hwa and Vivian Balakrishnan.

> Construction on the linkway started in 2014.

> When asked, the LTA said more time was needed due to the ""presence of high rock levels during excavation and multiple utilities over-crossing the construction shaft of this new entrance"".

> ""As these utilities could not be diverted, more time was needed for the contractor to carry out manual mining works around the utilities, to avoid damaging them and inconveniencing residents and stakeholders in the area,"" the spokesman said.

> Mr Liang, who is grassroots adviser for the Zhenghua ward in the GRC, said the new underpass can serve as many as 50 housing blocks, or about 8,000 households in the area.

> Those living more than a kilometre away can also cycle to the underpass and park their bicycles nearby, he added.

> Amenities such as West View Primary School, Pacific Healthcare Nursing Home and Senja Soka Centre are also a short walk away from the underpass entrance.

> ""With the underground connectivity, residents can avoid the busy traffic junction. I recognise that it&apos;s a challenging (construction) site for the engineers... but we should still build it. It&apos;s a bit late, but it&apos;s better than not being there ,"" Mr Liang said.

> Two motorcyclists were involved in what appeared to be a rather severe accident on Nov. 25.

> High impact

> Dashcam footage posted to Facebook page Roads.sg captured the scene, which took place at the junction of Bukit Panjang Rd and Bangkit Rd.

> In the video, a motorcyclist in yellow is about to make a discretionary right turn from the opposite lane.

> As he crosses the middle of a junction, another motorcycle moving at high speed crashes into him.

> Both riders are flung off their vehicles — the rider in yellow lands curled up in the middle of the junction, and the other rider flies through the air for several metres.

> The latter appears to sit up after landing on the road, while one of the motorcyclist's helmet spins to a stop on the road.

> The impact was so great that the second motorcycle was smashed, with the bollard receiving the brunt of the impact.

> In response to Mothership's queries, the Police said that the accident occurred at around 7:39pm.

> Two male motorcyclists, aged 42 and 65, were conveyed conscious to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

> Police investigations are ongoing.

> Discretionary right turns a hazard

> Several Facebook users in the comments lamented the dangers of discretionary right turns.

> Such areas are common sites for traffic accidents, and numerous accidents have led to petitions being formed and speeches in Parliament to scrap discretionary right turns.

> Earlier this year, the Land Transport Authority announced that Red-Amber-Green (RAG) arrows will be installed at 1,200 junctions by 2023.

> The arrows help control right turns at these junctions and make these crossings safer for motorists and pedestrians alike.

1403,23,gdqqud7,t3_k1v79s,"The coloured-arrows are themselves a hazardous design flaw. 

The colors and the shape of the arrows send conflicting messages. These are [color-shape correspondence issues. ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2041669519834042)

Eg. Shape of pointing arrow means ‘GO’, normally. But colours Red means ‘NO GO’. 

So gotta spend extra brain power in split-second to decide ‘GO’ or ‘NO GO’. It’s worse if it’s during heavy rain, or busy traffic conditions, or driver distracted, or all three.

Edit 1

For more info, check up on topics like [cognitive design](https://cognitive.design) , [human factors and ergonomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics?wprov=sfti1),  Its partially in such nuances in designs which European products fetch premium prices.

1406,23,gdqyk17,t1_gdqqud7,"Kinda understand where you're coming from. There's no redundancy in the lights. 1 suggestion is to use a red cross. Where both the cross and the red tint denotes NO GO.

But, this gives ambiguity. The red cross means no right turn only or no straight AND right turn. A red cross over right turning arrow makes the picture complicated, increasing the processing time.

Currently, the red arrow works because it relies on top down processing. Granted it may not be the best approach (using the example you used, go vs no go), it's fast.",t3_k1v79s,27-11-2020
1407,23,gdr1gf7,t1_gdqqud7,"I don't think it's difficult to understand since we have always gone by red as ""NO GO"" and green as ""GO"". Traffic lights are also standard with a round green as ""GO"" and round red as ""NO GO"". 

On your point of deciding whether to go or not, the slower you drive, the more time to process information. And it is actually good sense and also the law to slow down when approaching junctions in the event you need to stop for red light. Add on to the fact that you need to turn, then it is more important to slow down. 

Hence, as a driver, I don't see any problems in the design. The bigger problem is probably the fact that we have a mix of discretionary  and compulsory turning lights. This is where I feel would create accidents.",t3_k1v79s,27-11-2020

>         Mar 23, 2018, 3:24 pm SGT SINGAPORE - The Bukit Panjang LRT network will be closed every Sunday for 11 weeks, starting April 15, as part of maintenance works aimed to improving the reliability of the beleaguered system.
Rail operator SMRT announced this during a press conference on Friday (March 23), adding that 30 shuttle buses, running parallel to the LRT network, will be deployed during this time to provide commuters with additional transport options.
The works include the replacement of sections of the power rail as well as the replacement of track switch components. ""More intensive maintenance works, such as the replacement of sections of the power rails, are not possible with the short two to three-hour engineering window between services,"" said Mr Roger Lim, SMRT&apos;s Circle Line and Bukit Panjang LRT vice-president.
""Closing the network on Sundays will improve the productivity of our maintenance teams, and allow these works to be completed sooner.""
These works are separate from the renewal works for the LRT system that will be undertaken by supplier Bombardier, beginning in the second quarter of next year. A contract for these renewal works - expected to be completed by 2024 - was signed on Friday between the Land Transport Authority and Bombardier.

> The beleaguered BPLRT has been hit by a number of disruptions since it first opened in 1999.

> 

> In January 2018, service was disrupted for five hours after a piece of trackside equipment was damaged by a train.

> 

> In his speech, Mr Khaw said he had to defend the reliability of the BPLRT early on in his political career, when he was the Senior Minister of State for Transport.

> 

> ""The MPs were not too convinced,"" he recalled.

> 

> In 2017, Mr Khaw had himself compared riding on the LRT to a ""roller-coaster"".

> 

> He added he was determined to address the problems facing the BPLRT ""decisively"" when he became Transport Minister four years ago.

> 

> The approach taken was to completely renew the LRT line, he said.

> 

> Last year, Canadian firm Bombardier - the original supplier for the BPLRT - was awarded a S$344 million contract to renew the ageing line, including the replacement of existing signalling system with a new communications-based train control signalling system and the replacement of 19 light rapid vehicles.

> 

> These vehicles will be delivered by the third quarter of next year, and will be tested before being progressively introduced beginning in 2021.

> 

> The new signalling system is expected to be ready by 2022, with the new power rail system in place the following year.

> 

> These renewal works are on track to be fully completed by 2024, and allow the BPLRT to close the reliability gap with the Sengkang-Punggol LRT line, said Mr Khaw.

> 

> Separately from Bombardier's efforts, SMRT has introduced its own initiatives to improve reliability on the BPLRT.

> 

> These include the replacement of 34 sets of switch rails - which guide the direction of the light rail vehicles - reducing the likelihood of power trips.

> 

> The SMRT maintenance team also designed a workaround that prevented collector shoes - which connect the light rail vehicles to the power rails - from dislodging, which caused a number of power trips and disruptions to LRT services in the past.

> 

> Extended engineering hours resting from the closure of the lines as well as late openings on certain weekends allowed for a more intensive maintenance regimen, SMRT said.

1449,23,dw9ekl6,t3_871ag5,"> #New Bukit Panjang hawker centre design unveiled; construction to begin this year: NEA

> SINGAPORE: Construction works for a new two-storey complex in Bukit Panjang will begin in the fourth quarter of this year, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said on Sunday (Mar 25).

> The design plans for Senja Hawker Centre were unveiled to Bukit Panjang residents for the first time at Zhenghua Community Centre.

> Located along Senja road, the proposed development will have 38 cooked food stalls on the second floor, and a car park below with 82 car lots.

> It will also have a roof garden above the hawker centre. According to NEA&apos;s tender which was published on the government’s e-procurement portal, GeBIZ, the proposed development will also have a trellis at the roof garden to provide ""flexibility for future installation of solar panels by others"".

> Other sustainable features include a pneumatic waste conveyance system that will transport waste automatically to a central collection station through a network of pipes. This will remove the need to collect waste manually. 

> The project is expected to attain Green Mark GoldPlus and high Universal Design Mark rating, as well as meet the national productivity drive through the adoption of productive technologies. This includes creating a three-dimensional model of the building before it&apos;s even built, so that any problems which surface can be corrected immediately.

> It will also see more stakeholders getting involved earlier during the planning stage of the construction as part of the Early Contractor Involvement (ECI), which is a procurement approach introduced by the Building and Construction Authority.

> Contractors will be engaged early to provide inputs during the design stage. According to NEA, this will lead to ""better construction productivity and constructability, which may lead to overall time or cost savings"".

> This is also the first time NEA is adopting this procurement approach in the development of a hawker centre. Going forward, the authority says the approach may be adopted in future projects, if evaluated to be effective in the development of hawker centres.

> A total of 32 suppliers bid for the proposed development in the pre-qualification exercise, which closed on Mar 12.

> Construction of the new hawker centre is expected to be completed by 2020.

> Speaking at an event, Holland-Bukit Timah GRC MP Liang Eng Hwa said the new hawker centre will provide more choices and affordable food to residents.

> ""The area that the hawker centre is located at is actually quite a new area, with quite a high density housing over there so there are still insufficient or inadequate eating places over there. There are a few coffeeshops but not enough to be able to cater to the big and growing population there,"" said Mr Liang.

> The new hawker centre is part of a five-year masterplan announced in 2015 to improve Holland-Bukit Panjang Town. Under the plan, a new polyclinic will also be built in Senja by 2020.
