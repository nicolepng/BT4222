Corporal punishment ingrains in a person that an action is wrong only because the result if you are found out is pain, which causes a mindset of ""I can do it if I'm not going to get caught"".

It does not, however, teach a child not to do certain actions because they are intrinsically wrong, and morally corrupt.

The child that receives corporal punishment can grow into an adult that eventually learns the moral standing of certain actions, sure, but the motivation for abstinence from wrongdoing will never be divorced from punishment, which is likely the leading cause for a lot of repressed criminalia.

So is it racist if you are against people of the same colour from another country? Is it racist for a Norwegian to dislike Danish for example? 

I can tell you most not so nice remarks against foreign Indians, I hear it more openly from Singaporean Indians in real life than from Chinese. Probably because if we say it, it's racism. Whereas them being Indian can speak out against their own colour.

Ya know Malaysian Chinese don't like Singapore Chinese in Malaysia too.

I been told off by Malaysian Chinese to stay out of their country. But that's the way it goes. I don't think it's racist. Some bad Singaporean behaviour got all of us painted by the same brush. 

And I feel like such things usually can become friends if you prove yourself to be not the same. 

I find this exactly the same for other races who make generalized remarks painting another race in whole. You can change their minds. 

I always feel people fighting racism with hostility and aggression are just, causing those racist against you to hate you more except more silently. 

Not the correct solution. 

It's not gonna bring different races together but make them hate each other more silently if people don't become friends but just be more wary of each other.

If the goal is genuine friendship between different colours. Each colours have to show each other kindness the worst they think of you.

If the goal is to go slaughter all who are racist. Racism will never be eliminated as you use fear to subdue them. Which confirms their impression that you are the enemy.

Believe it or not, I have been told to go back to China by a Singaporean Indian in Singapore. Was just walking pass at a hdb pass an Indian lady who started attacking me. 

I just treat her as a crazy and move on. That's it.

I been spat on my head by a self proclaim nazi white skin when I was in the US. I just looked at him confused while he was saying derogatory things to me.

Sedition act in Singapore is one of those selective offences.  
[https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/SA1948?ProvIds=pr3-](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/SA1948?ProvIds=pr3-).

From the law itself, there's 5 parts to it but the one in question is part (e)  to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population of Singapore. 

In theory, saying stuff that promote ill will against other races is considered seditious, and by curbing this, promotes racial and religious harmony.

In practice however, it is rather selective and kinda stifle free speech. 

For example, bin burning. I hate bin burning that is largely practiced by some Chinese community.

171,23,gikkv5g,t3_kt682p,"To be honest they screwed up all the design of the old stations. You can compare how they are salvaging by looking at the newer stations of today's time.

Newer stations have staggered escalator landings so that the opposite-facing crowd would not have to cross each other to get to where they want. In some stations the stairs were also placed so that they are the shortest route to the gantries - reducing the load on the escalators.

All these realisations came only after all these years as the trains were not so crowded back then - I would say there were even enough seats for everybody in the 90s.",t3_kt682p,08-01-2021

Getting off a Joo Koon train, you get down to ground level and shove through people before tapping out and going out the big exit-only part to go to the bus interchange. A possible solution is to turn the exit only into a two way entrance/exit, and have the gantries closest to the Pasir Ris platform be entrance. However, that would shift the collision area to outside the outside of Boon Lay MRT, near the giant sheltered area. Thankfully, the area is spacious and you can go through JP anyway, so I suggest that they switch some exit gantries to entrance gantries.",t3_kt682p,09-01-2021

Also, I do agree. From what I managed to read so far, the initial stations are just built quickly with the intention to facilitate crowd movement and stuff. 

Citing:

The North-South Line, launched in 1987, and the East-West Line (1989) were the first Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) lines in Singapore.

The designs of stations on both lines were basic, with the emphasis more on engineering and safety with simple aesthetics.

But a key concern, then and now, has been crowd movement.

Says Mrs Sushma Goh, director of architecture at the Land Transport Authority (LTA): ""One of the most important station design considerations is to facilitate unimpeded passenger movement.

""The size of the station platforms, the length of queues forming at fare gates and even the width and height of the entrances are meticulously conceptualised to enhance crowd flow.""

The template for the North-South and East-West lines initially had no provisions for lifts, with only one upriding escalator at entrances and two standalone access points into the stations.

These stations were subsequently retrofitted in the 2000s to enhance barrier-free accessibility.

Toa Payoh station is not only Singapore's first station, but it is also distinguished by a double-volume space featuring a lofty ceiling, not common among the underground stations on the North-South and East-West lines.

Its capacious platform was later adopted as a common design feature to enhance commuters' experience in the North East Line (NEL) stations.

The NEL stations opened in 2003, marking a turning point in Singapore's MRT station design.

More entrances sited closer to residential areas and leading to underground stations were built, lifts were included from concourse to platform as well as tactile routes, new signage systems, better quality architectural finishes and even integrated community-focused art programmes such as LTA's Art In Transit, which featured artworks created by students and local artists.

From that point, Singapore's architects kept pushing the design envelope, incorporating wheelchair access and encouraging feedback to guide future designs.",t3_kt682p,09-01-2021

Frequent users of Bukit Batok MRT would have been familiar with the changes in gantry position by now. I suggest adding barriers (drawn in purple) instead.


=Entrance Flow=

We need to consider the flow from the bus interchange, which is a straight, efficient path to the current entrance gantry.

The incoming passengers will pass behind the escalator. Why? Because this is where the security check is located. SGSecure FTW.

=Exit Flow=

I would suggest having barriers outside the gantry as well, to separate those heading to west mall and heading into the mrt (from mall) . During peak hours its a shit show this part.

=Other Features=

I would like to draw attention to the slanted barrier near the service counter (highlighted yellow). The reason for this is so that the incoming and outgoing passengers can still access the service counter window located at that corner.  This still leaves room for the wheelchair exit gantry right beside it. Most times I see people in this area. But that's just my experience.

The lift area is kept accessible to incoming and outgoing passengers, but signage needs to be present to indicate how people should move

EDIT: right, I messed up the elevator and stairs position on the far end oh well. I think we can allow cross flow at that part because not many people take the stairs up :O",t3_kt682p,10-01-2021

353,23,dyskttd,t3_8ikvsk,"SINGAPORE - More than 30 people were injured after two buses collided at a Bukit Batok bus stop on Friday morning (May 11).

The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and police told The Straits Times they were alerted to the accident in Jalan Jurong Kechil, near Old Jurong Road, at about 9am.

SCDF said that 33 people were taken to three hospitals. They include 14 people who were taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, another 14 to National University Hospital and five to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

Police added that the victims were conscious when taken to hospital, and ST understands that their injuries were not serious. A pregnant woman was believed to be among the injured.

In response to queries, SBS Transit senior vice-president of corporate communications Tammy Tan said on Friday that the accident involved service 157, which had collided into an SMRT bus at the bus stop. 

Five SBS Transit communication teams are currently at the hospitals to render assistance to the injured, she said.

""We are very sorry that this has happened and our priority now is the well-being of all injured passengers,"" she added.

""We are also assisting the police and the Land Transport Authority in their investigations.""

Facebook user Linie Gabas Sajonia shared photos of the aftermath in a post at about 10am, which show a badly damaged SBS Transit bus that had partially mounted the kerb.

A safety bollard at the bus stop was able to break the impact of the vehicle.

The front windscreen of the bus was smashed and a large part of its front bumper had also fallen off.

Another photo shows an SMRT bus, which was plying service 970, with dents on its rear. Metal debris could be seen on the road.

When The Straits Times arrived at the scene at about 11am, staff and workers from the transport operators could be seen working to clear the debris. The SMRT bus was towed away at about 11.30am. 

The Land Transport Authority tweeted at about 10.15am that there was an accident on Jalan Jurong Kechil (towards Jalan Tekukor) after Old Jurong Road.

Motorists were told to avoid the leftmost lane.

Police investigations are ongoing.

ST has contacted SMRT for more information.",t3_8ikvsk,11-05-2018

I agree with her that hdb is unhelpful af. I went to my MP, Macpherson's tin pei Ling, for appeal to not raise my rent because I was freshly graduated.

Difference is..

1) I was able to purchase flat with one of my parent using only my cpf. Somemore got additional grant moving out of rental flat. No idea why she wasn't allowed that option. Maybe because her mum own flats before? No idea.

2. My mp wasn't such a an unsympathetic and cruel asshole who ask me to blame my parents. She didn't even ask me ""why your parents never buy flat?"" in fact she was very warm, smiling to me and assuring me that my financial situation and life will be better despite rent being raised. She also said my parents should be very proud of me for being able to graduate uni and take care of them despite coming from a lower income family etc. It was really quite encouraging to my just graduated, lost and stressed me. 

3. Hdb called me like within the week to tell me they received ms tin's letter. Although they still refuse to lower my rent, and offer me to downgrade. They also ask me to provide a doctors letter to say my mom needs her own room. Like which doctor will write that????

So my perspective is that hdb ultimately sucks when you're not the young couple buying first flat narrative, and her MP is shitty. My MP tried but well it didn't succeed but at least she's nice. Ive another friend staying in same block with same situation, but she managed to get hers lowered. I know our cases are all similar but yet different so it's not exactly about whether our cases is approved as a benchmark for the candidate but again assuming this story is true then that mp handled the initial interaction with her horribly.

440,23,fw8dpbb,t1_fw6115t,"As someone who's lived in BB for the last 10 years I have to concur with this. 

  
Murali has only been helpful in his approach, especially in a case where my grandmother slipped, fell and hit her eye due to negligent practices by lift renovators (cardboard loosely secured, easy to trip over).

We approached both the town council but the person who took our call pushed the responsibility to HDB, since they gave the contract to the renovators. HDB then pushed us to directly contact the renovators, you know the standard cycle of responsibility taiji.

We emailed Murali directly to inform him of this (photos, evidence and everything else included) and he came personally to our house and sat down with our family to hear us out. He didn't dismiss our concerns and in fact applied pressure on both the town council and HDB to resolve the issue (basically forcing them to stop taiji). Some people are going to argue that he should be in charge of the town council anyway but I'm pretty sure our query didn't reach him the first time so I won't blame him for the oversight.

He then got the company to cover the entire hospital bill (my grandmother had to be hospitalized for 2-3 weeks and the bill was pretty high, including follow-up sessions) and got the company's representatives (contractor and subcon) to come to our unit to personally apologize to my grandmother.   

During a regular house visit later he also remembered my grandmother and sat down with her again and asked about her recovery and other concerns. My sister and mother have also nothing but good experiences with him - he once met them outside near the local CC and they apparently discussed some stuff about the piano.

I think everyone has different experiences but I'd just like to voice mine on him. He'll have my vote this coming election despite the other controversies happening with the PAP.",t3_hgsumg,28-06-2020
441,23,fw6k2o1,t1_fw6115t,"Honestly, it's not so much about Murali and more about the policies that are in place. Not being able to buy your own flat as a single has been an issue for a while along with the difficulties of a single mother. Unfortunately, Murali is powerless to deal with the issues because the same policies were put in place by his party, which is why we need an opposition party to bring this up.   


As for the leakage, from personal experience, I have asked my MP (Not Murali) to help me with other issues personally and they directed me to certain agencies, who direct me to other agencies too. It became game where they pushed responsibilities to one another to avoid additional work and unfortunately my MP didn't follow up with them about it, nor with me.

The way PM Lee was given so much goddamm airtime to do his character assassination piece while Dr Chee only gets a couple lines of rebuttal (all he says is hope we have a good fight) was brutal to watch on national tv. Even the other top ministers stepped in and get quoted to question his character and all in the newspapers. At some point the by-election wasn‚Äôt about Murali vs Dr Chee, it was PAP vs Dr Chee and they really flung everything at him media machinery and all. And yet despite all that baiting he never once fought back on their level throughout that by-election iirc. 

I really don‚Äôt agree with his party‚Äôs policies, but no matter how much I hear that he‚Äôs a POS from the people in power, his conduct during the campaign period say otherwise about his character. Likewise, it calls into question the character of the people doing the roasting. The result was of course still PAP‚Äôs win, but he did also get his best result ever.

> 3. Stick the magnet to a whiteboard located in front of the drink stall, where a person in need can take to redeem

> And here‚Äôs the aforementioned whiteboard:

> Not bad.

> This system of free meals, according to the poster, is intended for people who were ‚Äúidentified by Bukit Batok East Zone 2 RC‚Äù, however.

> If you‚Äôd like to support this effort and visit the coffee shop, you can find it at Block 265 Bukit Batok East Ave 4, #01-405, Singapore 650265.

> Folks who saw Kooh‚Äôs post largely praised it and shared it as well, encouraging others to contribute to the effort.

> There, staff from the local community club and residents‚Äô committee provide cards to residents in need who can flash it to redeem cups of coffee or tea.

> There certainly are challenges in implementation, with both these projects, that could be improved, however ‚Äî folks who are in need may not feel very dignified queuing up with a magnet in hand, or even with flashing a card, for instance.

> Perhaps the nationwide effort to move toward cashless payment may aid efforts like this, especially at hawker centres, where if everyone used cards to pay, with the needy also perhaps having pre-paid meals loaded onto their cards, it can all be made more discreet.

> One of the earliest movements in this direction was called [link is removed], started by Singaporean Michelle Tan in 2013.

> The idea behind it was much more community and ground-up driven, going with the idea that it is stallholders who will know who the needy are, and would be able to identify them and provide free meals for them.

> Paying the stallholders money for meals in advance, or ‚Äúchoping‚Äù meals for the needy, supports the hawkers in their endeavour to show kindness to the needy who patronise their stalls.

> Tan, who was inspired by the concept of [‚Äúsuspended coffees‚Äù](http://suspendedcoffees.com/) overseas, advocated the movement even while she fought brain cancer, and eventually succumbed to it in 2015, but what she started led to a chapter in Kuala Lumpur as well:

> SINGAPORE - The woman injured in the Bukit Batok fire on Nov 1 - where officers were unable to use the fire hose reels - died in hospital on Monday (Dec 9), said a spokesman for the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).

> The woman in her 60s was rescued from the 13th-floor unit of Block 210A Bukit Batok Street 21 and had been receiving medical treatment at SGH for more than a month since the fire.

> The woman, along with her husband believed to be in his 60s and their son in his 30s, had earlier been hospitalised for burn injuries and smoke inhalation, after the fire which began at about 4am that day.

> The hospital had earlier said her husband was discharged from hospital about a week after the fire and her son was discharged on Nov 15.

> In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Bukit Batok MP Murali Pillai wrote: ""Friends, I regret to inform you that Mdm Goh, the Blk 210A fire victim on 1 Nov 2019, has passed away.

> ""Mdm Goh's family asks that their privacy be respected during this trying period. Deepest condolences to them. Wishing them strength to cope with the loss of Mdm Goh. RIP.""

> Mr Murali, who landed in Berlin on Monday as part of a delegation accompanying President Halimah Yacob on her five-day state visit to Germany, told The Straits Times that he has cut short the trip.

> He said he was flying back on Tuesday to Singapore to support the family, whom he has personally been in touch with over the past six weeks.

> On the day of the fire, Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) firemen had tried to use the hose reels at the block to put out a blaze that started in the 13th-floor flat.

> They found that the hose reels cabinet was locked, and after they broke open the locks, found that the hose reels were dry.

> The fire had to be extinguished using water from SCDF's emergency vehicles.

> Later that day, SCDF inspected the reels with representatives from the Jurong-Clementi Town Council (JCTC), which was then issued with Fire Hazard Abatement Notices (FHAN) for non-compliance with fire safety requirements.

> The notices are warnings that require town councils to fix the non-compliance.

> The town council, which the Bukit Batok single-seat ward comes under, would receive a notice of a composition fine of up to $5,000 or even prosecution, should the SCDF detect non-compliance issues of the same nature during a re-inspection.

> Mr Murali apologised on Nov 15 over how the fire hose reels that could not be used by firemen, telling residents that he was accountable to them as their elected representative.

> He also disclosed that a contractor responsible for ensuring there is water supply to the hoses was being investigated, and that two town council officers would also be disciplined for padlocking the cabinets.

>

> Related Story Female victim injured in Bukit Batok fire still in ICU, two male victims discharged

> Mr Murali said the SCDF took notice of the matter on the day of the fire, and it was not a result of ""anyone else drawing attention to this matter"", in an apparent reference to a claim by Singapore Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan that the SCDF's follow-up with the town council came after he made a report.

> Dr Chee, who had contested in Bukit Batok against Mr Murali in the 2016 by-election, called on the MP to account for the matter after hearing from residents about the faulty hose reels.

> Investigations by JCTC revealed on Dec 2 that an employee of JKeart Alliances Pte Ltd, the contractor responsible for maintaining the fire hose reels in Bukit Batok, had left a pump switch in the wrong mode, resulting in water supply to the hose reels being cut off during a fire.

> JCTC found that on the day of the fire, at about 8am, a JKeart employee had taken one of the lifts to the top floor from which the pump room can be accessed.

> On further questioning by JKeart, the man confessed that he had indeed gone to the pump room. That was when he realised he had left the selector switch of the pump in the dormant ""manual-mode"" after conducting maintenance on the system two weeks before the fire.

> He immediately switched it to ""auto-mode"", which activated the pumping of the water to the hose reel system.

> 

> The fire had to be extinguished using water from SCDF's emergency vehicles. PHOTO: LIANHE ZAOBAO

> 

> JCTC said it would issue a Notice of Non-Performance to JKeart holding it contractually responsible for failing to ensure that the hose reel system was operationally ready.

> Meanwhile, JKeart has informed JCTC that it has taken appropriate action against its employee, who will also be redeployed.

> As to how the hose reels cabinets were padlocked, JCTC said one of its property officers had done so as the cabinets were frequently vandalised.

> Both of them then followed the iguana downstairs.

> Here are more photos of the creature on the grass patch:

> While waiting for Acres to arrive, they also kept watch to ensure that it did not run on to the road.

> Khoo added that the sight of the iguana had caused quite a bit of commotion, with some residents, including his father, being ‚Äúquite excited to see it‚Äù.

> Khoo said that Acres arrived at around 3pm.

> Iguanas not native to Singapore

> The creature appears to be exotic, with its vivid orange colouration.

> The iguana might also be male, as males often develop a orange-red colour during breeding season.

> Iguanas are not native to Singapore, though.

> Iguanas, which refer to a whole genus of the reptiles, originate in Central and South America, and are vastly different from Singapore‚Äôs native monitor lizards and green crested lizards.

> They thus cannot be found in the wild here‚Äîthe one spotted in Bukit Batok could potentially have been an escapee pet.

> Illegal to keep iguanas as pets

> Incidentally, it is also illegal to keep iguanas as pets in Singapore.

> According to the Animal Veterinary Services (AVS), these exotic pets could potentially threaten the survival of native wildlife should they be released into the wild and propagate.

> They might also face difficulties adapting to the wild environment.

> Any member of public that spots an iguana out and about can call Acres via their 24-hour wildlife rescue hotline at 9783 7782.

The developer has too much choice in deciding which firm they contract to do the EIA (they can anyhow do, i honestly doubt every single firm has someone with the expertise to sample the more elusive animals like insects and reptiles). I honestly dk how people in the 00s got away with protecting Chek Jawa, idk if it will fly today under today's govt.

as for the footpaths thing, it's already messing up the microclimates in Bukit Timah (primary forest trees are probably more sensitive to the canopy layer being disrupted and the sun getting through) and killing off trees there. Such is the Anthropocene, if it doesn't have some kind of value to humanity it's either destroyed or commodified. I'm all for leaving places like Clementi Forest or Bukit Batok or Mandai as-is (not to mention that there's already several dirt trails in all those locations, which should be sufficient for hikers who want to explore) but of course it has to be sanitized and commodified if it is to conform to the government's vision.

Between Singaporean and wild boar, I pick Singaporean every time. Sorry wild boar, no matter how nice a BBC documentary about you will look with David Attenborough would be, you just gotta go.

On the other, it's not immediately clear that forests should be the first to go. When the G says that ""sorry bopian, we have to clear the nature areas"", they're not saying that housing is more important than forest, they're saying that preserving Good Class Bungalow minimum plot size ([https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/Summary-Detached.pdf](https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-control/Landed-Housing/Summary-Detached.pdf)) is more important than forest, they're saying reserving large chunks of land for exclusive military use is more important than forest. So I think the true battle isn't between new couples wanting to BTO and the wild boar, it's really between wild boar and owners of GCB / other types of protected areas that privilege certain classes in society - with the poor new couple wanting to BTO getting caught in the middle.

If we just merge 5 plots of GCB, and build 2 blocks of HDB on that area, I'm sure the whole Bukit Batok nature area can be easily preserved.",t3_ka8g06,10-12-2020

At the end of the day, he strikes me as someone who has achieved peak levels of narcissism and hypocrisy. He prides himself as being 'thick-skinned' and being able to 'weather attacks'. He expects that political commentators should expect attacks and pushback from the public, yet religiously sanitizes his facebook page of anything resembling criticism. The result? A carefully curated echo-chamber---one which is far more monolithic than reddit.

I don't think he's trying to squirm his way back to the PAP---he's enjoying all this attention he gets from his fans as it is.

If you fight back, you are at fault.
If you win the fight, you might get punished.
If you get beat up, might not be able to get justice due to the way the law is.

3) most important reason. I live there. I do not want to everyday have to worry for my safety walking through there if they are regularly hanging out there.

Both should have been aware of each other's presence (unless either was distracted, but as a cyclist, you should always ride defensively! Never expect anyone to give way to you, especially pedestrians on the footpath, cuz they **shouldn't need to!**). This sort of collision should not be happening at all, and there's really not many scenarios to think about when you see this kind of accident happen.

Police investigations are still on-going, but there's a high probability that it was one of the following scenarios that occurred:

1. Teenager was using his phone/mobile device, and not paying attention to his surroundings
2. Teenager was distracted by something other than his phone/mobile device and not paying attention to his surroundings.
3. Teenager was speeding and did not have brakes on his bike
4. Teenager was speeding and brakes were faulty

I don't think it's necessary to ban cyclists from the footpath, but all cyclists need to be alert, responsible, and ensure that their bikes are safe. Before you ride, always check your bike, and always keep to the speed limit (10km/h on footpath, 25km/h on PCN & Cycling Path). 

And when you ride, always ride with discretion (control your speed according to the conditions, don't ride at the limit just because you're legally allowed to), and ride defensively.",t3_kyial0,16-01-2021

As for the bit about cyclists not using the opposite side where there are PCNs, sometimes it's due to the lack of proper signage indicating where the PCN transitions (eg. the stretch along Loyang towards Changi Beach), other times it's because they're headed to a block/neighbourhood on that side of the road that they're already riding on.",t3_kyial0,16-01-2021

>While announced after the dinner around 9.30 pm, on 7th March all activities and classes at CCs and RCs attended by confirmed cases would be suspended for 14 days. This includes Bukit Batok CC, where the dinner was held. It would not have been impossible for you, Mr Murali, to have received early notification of this decision.

""And the transformation takes place. Four days a ago, I took this picture at BB and the site was a hazardous mess. Went back this morning and there is now at least a proper safety cordon in place. 

The site is not in some obscure corner in the estate. It's the most crowded spot in BB (Blk 154) with a wet market and huge hawker centre. 

And MP Murali didn't even see it?

This is what I mean when I say that MPs must go full-time. It's impossible to give your 100% if you spend all your time in your day job. This is what happens when you have a part-time MP.  

The people elect you to run the estate, you collect the $16k/month salary, out-source the work to a managing agent and then make the people pay for it. Someone please explain to me the logic.

With all the responsibilities entrusted upon you - running the Town Council, looking after the estate especially the residents' safety and wellbeing, representing them in Parliament, fostering a strong community, protecting the vulnerable - that's a full-time job.

The odds of this happening are not zero, but are extremely small.

# Fire hose reel padlocked, no water supply: SCDF issues a Fire Hazard Abatement Notice to Jurong-Clementi Town Council

The SCDF was looking to extinguish a fire but found that the fire hose reel was padlocked and had no water supply. They then issued a warning to Jurong-Clementi Town Council to rectify the problem immediately.

**Zaobao understands that this is the first time such a Fire Hazard Abatement Notice has been issued in recent years.**

Last Friday morning, when the SCDF arrived at Block 210A in Bukit Batok where one of the units was on fire, they found that the fire hose reel was locked.

According to a statement by the SCDF on 8 Nov, they broke the lock to access the reel, but found that the hose had no water supply, and had to make use of water supply from their own vehicles to extinguish the fire.

The SCDF pointed out that Town Councils have a responsibility to ensure that these emergency facilities are repaired and maintained, and were in working condition.

On the day of the fire, the SCDF had already informed the Town Council and worked with a Town Council representative to carry out an investigation. The SCDF confirmed after the investigation that all the hose reels in that block were back in working condition.

The SCDF also noted in the statement that if any future incidents happen that the Town Council would be slapped with a fine or even sued.

**Murali: Town Council will take immediate and relevant corrective actions**

An SCDF spokesperson told Zaobao that fire hose reels should never be locked, otherwise they would not be usable in emergencies. Without water supply to the hoses, firefighters might be delayed in rescue operations and could jeopardise the lives and property of residents.

Murali Pillai, the Town Council in-charge and MP for Bukit Batok, replied to Zaobao saying, ""We have already understood the situation and the Town Council will take this matter seriously.

He pointed out that while the Town Council prioritised providing necessary support and assistance to the families of those who were injured and the surrounding residents, he also learnt that the SCDF was investigating the issue of the locked fire hose reel and immediately assisted with investigations.

Murali said, ""The Town Council has been studying the Notice thoroughly and will take the relevant steps to address this problem.""

Murali had already visited in hospital the family of three who were rescued. Currently, the woman who was rescued is still being treated in ICU, her son is in the high dependency ward, and her husband has just been discharged.

Zaobao previously reported that on 1 Nov 4.30am, a fire broke out in one of the units in Block 210A in Bukit Batok, and a woman in her 60s was trapped in the toilet, with two men standing on the ledge outside their apartment's kitchen. The three of them breathed in excessive smoke and were seriously injured, and were sent to SGH for treatment. When interviewed, the police noted that investigations were in progress.",t3_dw8zn8,15-11-2019

> SINGAPORE: Firefighters from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) were unable to access water supply in the hose reels at Block 210A Bukit Batok Street 21 last month because a switch had been left on manual instead of auto mode.

> The Jurong-Clementi Town Council (JCTC) on Monday (Dec 2) released its findings after an investigation into the incident, saying that J Keart Alliances (JKeart), the contractor responsible for maintaining the hose reels, had been ""negligent in failing to ensure that a selector switch at the pump room"" was in the correct mode.

> Advertisement

> Signed statements that JKeart previously gave to JCTC asserting that the hose reels were in working condition were also incorrect, said the town council in a Facebook post.

> SCDF on Nov 9 said that it had issued a warning to JCTC after firefighters called to a blaze at an HDB flat found the hose reel cabinets on the 13th floor had been padlocked and the water supply cut off. Three people were injured in the fire.

> On Nov 13, JCTC said that the hose reels last underwent maintenance and testing by the appointed contractor on Oct 14, 2019 and were certified to be in working condition.

> Three people were rescued from the fire, which broke out on the 13th floor of Block 210A Bukit Batok Street 21 at about 4.30am on Nov 1. (Facebook/Murali Pillai)

> In its findings on Monday, JCTC said that CCTV footage showed a JKeart employee had gone to the pump room several hours after the fire on Nov 1. Upon questioning, the employee confessed that he had re-activated the water supply after the fire.

> 

> The JKeart employee had switched the selector switch to manual mode during a maintenance cycle conducted two weeks before the fire and had forgotten to switch it back to auto mode, said JCTC.

> Water supply to the hose reel is cut off when the switch is on manual mode.

> ""This failure had led to the hose reel system in Blk 210A having no water at the time when SCDF officers were engaged in the firefighting operation,"" said JCTC.

> ""JKeart, after revisiting the matter with the employee, informed JCTC that its earlier report asserting that there was water in the hose reel on the day of the fire incident was incorrect,"" it added.

> JCTC will issue a notice of non-performance to JKeart to hold it contractually responsible for its failure to ensure that the hose reel system was operationally ready.

> JKeart has also informed JCTC that it has taken ""appropriate action"" against its employee, who will also be redeployed, the town council said.

> ""A MISTAKE"" TO PADLOCK HOSE REELS: JCTC

> In its findings, JCTC said that the decision to lock the hose reel cabinets was taken by a property officer following ""frequent vandalism"" of the cabinets.

> ""This was a mistake, as it meant that the cabinets could only be opened with force during an emergency, as SCDF had done during the recent fire incident,"" the town council added.

> 

> The property officer ""will be redeployed"", the Facebook post read. Two senior officers with supervisory roles over the officer will also be penalised.

> 

> Firefighters conducting an aerial rescue of two men found on a ledge outside the kitchen. They could not be pulled to safety inside the flat due to a ""vast accumulation of items"". (Photo: Facebook/SCDF)

> JCTC also said that it has inspected the hose reels, fire extinguishers and other fire safety equipment in its seven wards to ensure they are in working condition.

> While almost all the hose reel systems are in operating condition, many cabinets and other equipment have been damaged through vandalism, it said, adding that it is taking ""urgent steps"" to repair and replace the items.

> ""JCTC will not hesitate to refer persons damaging and misusing fire safety equipment to the authorities for investigation,"" it said.

> ""JCTC is also looking into other steps to minimise the incidence of vandalism in the future, including changing the design of hose reel and fire extinguisher cabinets and their locking mechanisms.""

> The town council has set up a committee comprising of elected town councillors Mr Ang Wei Neng as chairman, Dr Tan Wu Meng and Mr Murali Pillai to recommend measures to ensure the reliability of fire emergency equipment.

> The committee will engage independent experts and residents before making its proposals for further corrective and preventive measures.

First, the radio towers. Can't miss it. The trail that leads to the base of those towers come from Old Jurong Road. From the top you can see all the way to the CBD. There are also populated old style terraces there. It's become something of a symbol to me. Not sure why.

Keming Primary School. Just because. I got my bike stolen there once. Locked it to the railing of the huge gutter and the chain got cut.

The marketplace beside Keming Primary. Lots of adorable stray cats. Plenty of bustle. Good eats behind the market.

Those huge condos. You know the one. The two huge ass condos. There's a secret wood trail by the side of the condos that leads to a shrine 
for some local spirit. I discovered it by chance as a wee lad and never got back to it. If you're around the area do check it out.

The road from East Avenue 5 pass Little Guilin to Bukit Gombak is magical to me. At 4pm or so the light comes in just the right way to make the trail seem like autumn. Especially when the tree sheds its leaves. You can try crayfishing at Little Guilin along the stone walls, with a line tied to your finger and some bait on the other end. Not sure if it's banned now but that used to be a thing with my uncle.

West Mall never changes. Maybe as a new resident you won't get the same nostalgia as I did when I went back to visit. But man it's like visiting an old friend.

And there's so much forest left untouched here. Everything is kinda retro and peaceful. It's so much more spacious in Bukit Batok. From one block you can see the rest of the East side and the hills. Where I used to live there's an entire square jungle left untouched. Breathing room is one of a kind. There's a quality to the air that I can't find anywhere else.

And at dusk or in the morning, the woo woo birds do their woo wooing. I think there's a lot more of them in Bukit Batok than anywhere else.

Bukit Batok has a personality unlike anywhere I've been. Maybe it's because I spent most of my childhood there. Stay there a while and explore the area. You might have a feeling for the place as special as the place is for me.",t3_ey5maf,03-02-2020

The prawn noodles here are pretty famous as well though I find it so-so. Note that the prawn noodles put dark soya sauce into their noodles so if you don't like dark soya sauce do mention to the owner. Their chicken rice is also quite well-received since there's always a  queue.

[Bao Fa Traditional Food](https://www.burpple.com/bao-fa-claypot-rice) :  Very well known for their Claypot Chicken Rice. Note that it's best that you call them and order in advance for them to cook as it takes \~30 to 40 mins wait time on weekends. The auntie is happier also imo. P.S. if it looks run down, feels run down but smells of amazing charcoal you've got the right place. 

**Bukit Batok West**

Blk 132 near the CC: Basically a midnight supper spot. There's a [Teochew restaurant](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Teochew+Cuisine+Restaurant+(Lee+Kwang+Kee)/@1.3503551,103.7459189,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x7bfc1c7e174d8282!8m2!3d1.3503551!4d103.7459189) that sells Kway Chap & Fish soup, though it's on the pricier end. Note that the Fish soup gets better as the day progresses imo. In the afternoon, the soup is less gao. The kway chap is notorious for being polarisingly good and bad; sometimes really good and sometimes really salty. Can buy toto nearby while you take the risk. There's also a Srisun nearby for prata and mee goreng. There's also a [zichar next to the CC](https://www.burpple.com/qi-lin-xuan-kitchen) which my friend says is amazing but to me is average. 

[Famous JB 101](https://google.com/maps/place/Famous+JB+101+@+Bukit+Batok+(Main)/@1.3370597,103.7574128,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da106e24b47a69:0x1d26e12cf8dc0782!8m2!3d1.3370543!4d103.7596015): Very, very ulu and inconvenient location. But the food makes up for it. Get the Fried Pork. P.S. If you hold birthday celebrations here, the restaurant will turn off their lights and play some really corny Happy Birthday tunes. 

**West Mall**

Ok these are my personal opinion but [ICG chicken](https://www.google.com/maps/place/ICG+Chicken+and+Burger+Singapore/@1.3496141,103.747095,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da11e71cd76e7b:0xf3200b0282f55474!8m2!3d1.3496087!4d103.7492837) at the Ground Floor sells nice and inexpensive Korean Fried Chicken. Lam's Specialty at the Koufu above also sells good bak chor mee, and their roasted chicken is always juicy. 

The better Ma La in the vicinity is in the [Coffee Shop](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Happy+Hawkers/@1.3488071,103.7504326,19z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x31da11e71cd76e7b:0xf3200b0282f55474!2sICG+Chicken+and+Burger+Singapore!8m2!3d1.3496087!4d103.7492837!3m4!1s0x0:0x9f4c455a332aee64!8m2!3d1.3491299!4d103.7508431) close to the McDonalds. The one in the Koufu in West Mall itself is expensive and not that good. 

[S-11](https://www.google.com/maps/place/S-11+Bukit+Batok+Food+House/@1.348925,103.7514208,20.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da100579c0eead:0xa3f518d42e5bb744!8m2!3d1.3492993!4d103.7516293): The Duck/Char Siew rice here has really good bang-for-buck value. If you eat in, you get a free bowl of soup with the meal which has either preserved vegetables or sometimes lotus root. 

**Non-food related:** 

Bukit Batok Town Park a.k.a [Xiao Guilin](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bukit+Batok+Town+Park+(%E2%80%9CLittle+Guilin%E2%80%9D)/@1.3556437,103.752322,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da10481370263d:0x7bd52a1da9b519eb!8m2!3d1.3556383!4d103.7545107) is actually really really small though it has some nice views. I personally find Bukit Batok Nature Park, which is at Bukit Batok East a much nicer place to walk about in the evening/morning. Once you're there, you can take the route less taken and walk over to [Bukit Batok WWII Memorial Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bukit+Batok+WWII+Memorial/@1.3501043,103.7650085,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da105b82ef9375:0xea4a5ec1facc150f!8m2!3d1.350925!4d103.7667), where you have to climb a daunting set of stairs. It's not actually that bad; especially when you come down from the peak, walk down the road to the main road and realise there are people who use the crazy steep road as a form of exercise. 

**Bukit Batok(ish):**

Bukit Batok is actually pretty close by to Hillview and also Beauty World. If you feel like splurging, you could head down to HillV2 and go for [Italian Osteria](https://www.google.com/maps/place/iO+Italian+Osteria+Singapore/@1.3501043,103.7650085,18z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1052bd99afe3:0xc623f1dc4961e5f2!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1053aa50898d:0xc66016df53793535!8m2!3d1.3629834!4d103.7645009) for some good Italian or get zi char at [Jiak](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jiak+Modern+Tzechar+@+Hillview/@1.3633615,103.7623987,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x31da1052bd99afe3:0xc623f1dc4961e5f2!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1052bd47fb13:0x477301144ebcf073!8m2!3d1.3633561!4d103.7645874).

The other market would be at Bukit Gombak. Incidentally though, my mom likes to go to the markets at Jurong West Avenue cause its bigger and usually have better deals for fruits.

I go for walks at Bukit Batok Nature Park. Its frequented by a lot of people and family, although I would not recommend going after dark.

- saizeriya newly opened at sunplaza level 3 is one of my new fav places to go eat as well
- the famous sembawang white beehoon (unfortunately i eat until sian alr) 
- if u want a fancier indian muslim food stall, go to rubinah which is located alongside ssc. they have an aircon dining hall and the food is not bad there as well
- my fav bokchormee would be the one at fairprice kopitiam located along the canberra park stretch, but thats my personal opinion i just think it tastes unique altho my parents dont understand why
- the other coffeeshop also along the canberra park stretch, directly opposite sembawang sec is brand new and their western food is quite cheap but u get what u pay for la. the portion sizes are damn small but it tastes not bad imo

im not really an outdoor/sporty person, but if you want
- canberra park is pretty near and looks quite good for morning walks and exercise to me, not to mention there are many swings there for the inner child in u HAHAHAHA
- sports centre opening soon at the ulu ssc area, so there will be swimming pool soon hehe

Condos are the Regent Heights. 

I've only been to the trail beside Regent Heights once. As for the trail to the towers, I only discovered it when I went back to visit. For 11 years I imagined they were completely inaccessible.

> SINGAPORE - A fire raged for at least three hours in the early hours of Saturday (Aug 3) at two warehouse units in Bukit Batok.

> The units, which are on the fourth floor of the industrial building, were used to store personal mobility devices (PMDs) and electrical items.

> The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a Facebook post that it was alerted to the fire at 2024 Bukit Batok Street 23 at about 1.20am.

> SCDF officers had to force their way into the units to contain the fire, they said.

> Three handheld water jets and an aerial water monitor were used to bring the fire under control.

> Firefighters extinguished the fire in about three hours, they added.

> There were no reported injuries.

> Related Story LTA reviews PMD safety certification deadline after PMD fires: Types of fires in homes and ways to fight them

> Related Story Spotlight on fire protection at HDB homes after string of blazes

> As of 3pm on Saturday, damping down operations to prevent the fire from rekindling from the hot burnt surfaces were still ongoing.

> The Straits Times understands that one of the warehouse units belongs to a wholesale firm called CJ International, which has listings for PMDs on its Facebook page.

> It also provides PMD repair services.

> A 30-year-old staff member of CJ International told Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Wanbao they will be assisting the SCDF in their investigations, and declined further comment.

> According to the paper, solar panels on the roof were burned too.

> The other affected unit houses Sim's Lighting Gallery, according to the building's directory.

> SCDF said it is investigating the cause of the fire.

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî Bukit Batok SMC Member of Parliament Murali Pillai apologised on Friday (15 November) over the fire incident at a block in his ward where firefighters at the scene encountered padlocked hose reel cabinets and the absence of water supply.¬†

> On 1 November, Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) firefighters arrived at Block 210A Bukit Batok Street 21 to combat a fire at the 13th floor. They came across the padlocked cabinets and had to break one of them to access the hose reel but were unable to use it as there was no water supply. Instead, they extinguished the fire using water from the SCDF‚Äôs emergency vehicles.¬†

> In a post on his Facebook page on Friday, Murali said, ‚ÄúAs your elected representative, I am politically accountable to you for these issues...These incidents should not have happened and, for that, I must apologise. I will work with my elected & appointed Town Councillors to review this case and ensure that the fire safety system is strengthened to ensure its reliability.‚Äù

> In response to media queries, Ana Zakaria, public relations manager for the Jurong-Clementi Town Council,¬†said on Thursday that the hose reels had previously been frequently misused and vandalised. ‚ÄúAs a precaution, a small padlock was used to prevent casual vandalism. We have since removed all padlocks.‚Äù she added.

> On the padlocking issue, Murali said the Town Council identified two officers as being responsible. ‚ÄúThis was a mistake on their part. They have admitted to their mistakes. The Town Council management will pursue disciplinary action against them,‚Äù he added.

> As for the water supply issue, JKeart, the contractor responsible for maintaining the fire hoses, ‚Äúinsisted that there was water supply to the hose reel in question at the material time‚Äù.

> JKeart provided to the Town Council a video of the hose reel in question in working condition on the day of the fire incident, according to Murali. The Town Council then met with SCDF officers earlier this week to provide what JKeart showed. Thereafter, the Town Council issued a statement accepting SCDF‚Äôs position on the matter and is now investigating JKeart‚Äôs assertions, he added.

> Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chief Chee Soon Juan has commented several times about the shortcomings arising from the incident. In a post on Thursday, Dr Chee said, ‚ÄúThe matter is of intense public interest and the longer Mr Murali delays giving a full account of the violations, the bigger the mockery he makes of Mr Heng Swee Keat‚Äôs call for MPs to win trust by being open and transparent.‚Äù

> In his response to Murali‚Äôs post, Dr Chee said in a separate post on Friday to commend the MP for addressing the matter. ‚ÄúI am gratified to note that the Town Council is investigating the inconsistencies and dubious practices, and that it will take action where needed,‚Äù he added.

> In 2016, the SDP secretary-general lost to Murali in the Bukit Batok by-election.

> Murali highlighted in his post that he had turned up at the scene just before 8am and by then, the three fire victims were already conveyed to hospital.

> While walking with the SCDF officers, the MP said that he learnt about the issues regarding the access and deployment of firehose on the 13th floor.

> Murali said he then focused on assisting the families affected by the fire at the block and also visited the fire victims in hospital. He revealed that one of the victims, Mdm Goh, was still in an intensive care unit and that he met her family members there.¬†

> Driving a taxi provides numerous opportunities to interact with interesting individuals from all walks of life.

> One taxi driver certainly experienced a rather amusing encounter recently.

> All coins

> On July 30, a cabbie surnamed Zaffre had picked up a young passenger from Orchard who was heading to Bukit Batok.

> Zaffre shared with Mothership that during the course of the trip, the ""teenage girl"" did not indicate whether she would be making payment with cash or card.

> Upon reaching the destination, she opted for cash to pay the S$17.20 taxi fare‚Äîbut not in the form of the notes that you might expect.

> Instead, the girl first handed him one 20 cents coin, followed by four paper packets of coins.

> Each packet had been stapled to seal it, and was labeled with the amount of money it contained.

> When questioned by Zaffre why she was paying the fare like this, the girl simply said that this was what she had.

> Took 10 minutes to count the coins

> Zaffre said that he initially felt annoyed and reluctant to accept the coins, as he was unable to count them at the moment.

> However, the girl apparently asked him to trust her that the amount was accurate.

> Zaffre said that he thought that perhaps the girl had taken the money from her piggy bank, and thus decided to give her the benefit of the doubt.

> Zaffre only managed to count the coins after work at home.

> It took him 10 minutes to do so, with the help of his daughter and son-in-law.

> Thankfully, the coins added up to S$17 like the girl had assured, despite two of the five cent coins being of China and Hong Kong currency.

> According to a Facebook post by Zaffre's daughter Liyanah, documenting the rather bizarre encounter, there were many five and 10 cent coins inside the packets.

> Liyanah added that although her father had been ""pissed"", she applauded the girl for being honest and for ""adding some humour to [their] lives"".

>          SINGAPORE - Three men were arrested for suspected drug-related offences on Saturday (March 24), after one of them was found slumped on his chair and another lying on the floor of a Bukit Batok coffee shop.
The Straits Times understands that police officers on patrol were alerted to the situation at Block 279, Bukit Batok East Avenue 3, by a passer-by.
Officers conducted a search and found drugs on the suspects, including unidentified pills and an unknown substance. It is believed that the men were taking drugs before police arrived. A video shared on Facebook on Sunday shows a man dressed in a yellow shirt on the floor, seemingly passed out.
Next to him, another man in a grey shirt, who is seated at a table, is slumped backwards on his chair.
A third man wearing red appears to be talking to a police officer. The police told ST that they were alerted to the incident at about 10am and arrested three men, aged between 55 and 56 years old, for suspected drug offences. One of the suspects, a 56-year-old man, was conscious when taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, police said.
ST understands that he was the man found lying on the floor.
A woman, who works at a bakery near the coffee shop, told Chinese-language newspaper Shin Min Daily News on Sunday that the man had collapsed to the ground suddenly.
She added that the man in the red shirt was a regular at the coffee shop.

1180,23,fxmb1un,t3_hp594s,"Bukit Panjang: Dr. Teo Ho Pin has been a really popular MP for this district since 1997. There is a reason why he was dubbed as the ""Auntie Killer"".


In terms of what Mr. Liang did for Bukit Panjang, he improved the infrastructure in Bukit Panjang in general as he was the MP for Zhenghua, the neighboring district, which is considered a part of Bukit Panjang Town. He has lobbied for new bus services, mainly service no. 972, which is one of the most used bus services in Bukit Panjang to connect BP to the downtown area. If Dr. Paul did not contest here, you will see results around the 35% mark like other SDP contested wards.


Bukit Panjang can be considered as a mature estate, being more than 30 years old. The newer parts of Bukit Panjang have been drawn into Holland-Bukit Timah. Therefore, it will always be a tough fight, not like newer districts like Sengkang who has a higher amount of younger voters which might swing the election, or Aljunied and Hougang where WP has a good track record in running the TCs.



A close to 15% vote swing is a respectable result for SDP, coming from where it was in 2015. Even Dr. Paul recognised that it will be a miracle if they were to win. Look at the results since 2006: 22.82 -> 33.73 -> 31.62 (islandwide swing to PAP) -> 46.26.",t3_hp594s,11-07-2020

EDIT: btw, both candidates did not do any house visit for my area/block in this GE. I‚Äôve stayed here for almost four years. Whether that‚Äôs a dealbreaker, I won‚Äôt know.

As someone who voted for Murali,

My family has benefited from Murali's assistance before. Everyone likes to highlight the accidents and call him a MIA MP here but to me he's done his part in making our lives better. You can check my post history for the long story, but it was an incident with my grandmother.

I will never condone CSJ's actions of badmouthing Singapore to foreign liberal media for brownie points. In a game where its supposed to be SG vs the world, he's proven that his ego is far more important that anything else. I'm willing to give chances to new candidates if they fuck up their first pr incident like TPL in the past and Raeesah from this election, no matter how much I disagree with them, but CSJ has been here for so long and he still repeats the same destructive garbage every election. His previous incident with CST also sits sourly with me, as I really respected CST as an opposition old guard. For CSJ who has had a record of belligerent behaviour, I can only interpret his current actions as the leopard knowing how to hide his spots. One less day with CSJ as an MP, one more day with a proper parliament. Might not even matter if he gets NMP though. Hope TCB's team takes the offer.

Again, try not to downvote, call me ignorant, say that I don't use social media, only watch CNA or any of the usual drivel. You'd think CSJ was some saint if you used reddit as your only info source. He decidedly isn't and honestly, he's only dragging Dr. Tambyah down.",t3_hp594s,11-07-2020

I distrusted Chee Soon Juan, disliked SDP's policy on NS, also disagreed on the rare few statements CSJ made on foreign policy but liked everything else about SDP's manifesto.

Interesting. No defense of her allegations. This sounds like the 'neither confirm nor deny' tactic US companies often do when being questioned by SEC over dubious practices. And they just pay a fine.

Here's an example:

>(Reuters) - Mylan NV has reached a tentative __agreement to pay $30 million to resolve a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission__ related to its emergency allergy shot EpiPen, which became the center of a firestorm over price increases.

>The drugmaker in a regulatory filing on Monday disclosed that it had reached an agreement-in-principle with the SEC's enforcement staff to resolve the investigation that dated back to 2016. __Mylan said it will neither admit nor deny wrongdoing as part of the accord.__

SINGAPORE - A case of tuberculosis was discovered in Bukit View Secondary School late last month, and screening is currently being conducted on students and teachers there.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Tuberculosis Control Unit (TBCU) were notified of the case of active TB on April 26, a MOH spokesman told The Straits Times.

The patient is believed to be a student.

""The patient was started on treatment and placed on medical leave after the clinical-diagnosis of TB was made. Contact screening has been started, and results are currently pending,"" the spokesman said. The patient is no longer contagious.

The school, located at Bukit Batok Street 21, was told four days later on April 30, vice-principal Shirley Lee told The Straits Times. ""The health and safety of our students and staff are our utmost concern,"" she said. ""We will also extend the necessary support to ensure the well-being of the school community.""

The school is currently working with the TBCU to carry out the contact screening, and will continue monitoring the situation.

According to students whom The Straits Times spoke to, their exams, which were held from April 26 to May 10, were not affected.

TB is typically spread through close and prolonged contact, and not through items or surfaces touched by a patient, according to the MOH spokesman.

Only persons who had been in close and prolonged contact with the infectious individual require screening by TBCU, the MOH spokesman said. ""TB is endemic in Singapore and latent TB infection is not uncommon in our population as TB had been prevalent in Singapore until the 1970s. Among older Singaporeans, up to 30 per cent may have latent TB infection,"" she added.

In March last year, a staff member at a PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots pre-school in Clementi Avenue 1 was found with active TB, requiring 66 staff and students to be screened. In August 2016, 104 children and 20 staff members of Little Greenhouse childcare centre in Bukit Batok were screened after a teacher was diagnosed with TB.

Everyone was sent an email to encourage going for a blood test, though it wasn't compulsory as it was unlikely for a full blown TB unless someone has a compromised immune system due to some pre-existing disease. The ones in danger are the caretakers and children/elderly. 

If latent TB is detected in a person, it can be killed by providing isoniazid over a period of few months. As stated, 30% of SGreans have latent TB which is unlikely to be full blown due to the immune system that a healthy adult has, but of course, no one will know when one's immune system will go bad so better to take the test if you've been listed. Latent TB is not contagious.

1289,23,e5ybsh7,t3_9fptf4,"SINGAPORE - Fuel retailer Singapore Petroleum Co (SPC) has secured a petrol station site at an all-time high bid of $92.7 million, signalling the China-owned entity's ambition to grow its presence here.

SPC, which has just dropped its ""leaping lion"" logo for owner PetroChina's flower emblem, beat the second-highest bidder - American oil giant Chevron - by 20 per cent.

Chevron, which currently operates a Caltex station at the Bukit Batok site, bid $77.3 million and SPC will take it over on a 30-year lease by the end of the year.

Chevron was followed closely by Shell, which put in $76 million, and newcomer Sinopec, which bid $63.2 million, according to the Housing Board's (HDB) latest tender results.

SPC's bid surprised the industry as much as Esso's $42 million bid for a site in Woodlands in 1997, which was close to 30 per cent higher than the next closest bid.

Neither SPC or PetroChina was reachable for comment, but an industry player said: ""SPC's bid was really crazy.""


Some observers worry that cost will be passed on to consumers, but veteran fuel consultant Ong Eng Tong - who used to work for SPC - said that would be unlikely as the fuels market here is ""very competitive"".

Mr Ong said oil companies will usually bid aggressively for high-volume sites - such as the one secured by SPC - and distribute the cost across its network.

SPC has 38 stations across the island, the same number as when PetroChina took over the company a decade ago.

The Straits Times understands Caltex will vacate the Bukit Batok site by the end of the year.

The bidding war comes on the back of record fuel prices, with diesel priced at $1.85 a litre before discount, and petrol as high as $2.80 a litre.

Mr Ong, however, reckons profit margins for the oil companies remain unchanged. ""It's a volume business,"" he said. ""And they make money from the convenience stores.""

It is the Singapore Government which enjoys the biggest windfall, he added. ""I suggest that the Ministry of Finance ask the transport fare commission not to increase bus and MRT fares, and use this windfall to fill in the shortfall so that more people will take public transport,"" he said.

1315,23,fx9m1oe,t3_hn28l7,"with regards to CSJ, character is important and if you do search for more information about his past, there are questions about the reports by MSM.

from what i understand in general, while he was working in NUS, he realised how the government policies would lead to issues today (mainly social issues, some of which he warned long ago and happening today). he wrote to papers opinions expressing so which NUS were not happy and did warn him as he kinda represent NUS.

he tape recorded his PAP boss who said that if you join the opposition you may lose your job. when the PAP boss found out he was angry as it was a casual conversation and was disappointed in that behaviour. he started to watch out for CSJ.

CSJ used university funds to pay for the postage of his wife‚Äôs papers to his wife‚Äôs uni. CSJ over claimed taxi fees. his PAP boss reported him after gathering evidence. NUS decided to let him go with 1 month notice.

CSJ still wanted to tell SG that the PAP boss did say if you join opposition, you will be penalised. so he made a big hoo ha and even went on a hunger strike.

NUS angry that he politicised this and fired him immediately because of the hunger strike.

the focus from MSM has been about him being dishonest with the $200+ Uni funds he used to send to his wife‚Äôs Uni. and him drinking glucose water tho he claimed to be on hunger strike. and how his PAP boss then was a mentor to him, pushed for his promotion but in return got tape recorded.

as much as CST protected CSJ despite the hoo ha he created, CST did not agree with his hunger strike behaviour. he was shocked when the SDP CEC did not agree with him. in the moment he felt his power slipping through his hands and threatened with a resignation letter.

members of the SDP were shocked. his resignation was likened to how LKY threatened to resign to keep his power as his members knew how important his presence was. they did not accept the resignation immediately and tried to persuade him to stay. CST demanded one of the party member whom he thought was a troublemaker to have to leave if they wanted him to stay. after some time, there was no news if CST was serious about it. so SDP sent CSJ to talk to CST. CSJ asked if the conditions for CST remains (kicking the other member out) as CEC will only give CST until 18 june to confirm if he wants to retract the letter. CST responded yes to the condition and something about an extended date to 30 june. CSJ went back and told CEC about the condition but forgot to mention the 30 June extension.

After 18 June, SDP announced CST resigned. CST was furious because he didn‚Äôt get what he wanted, and accused CSJ of purposely withholding CEC of the extension date, to take over his position. CST demanded CSJ to give up his position if it was not true.

CSJ replied that he did not intend to usurp the position. however, now that this responsibility has fallen on him, he cannot just throw it away like that. 

SDP & CSJ on many occasions still try to ask CST to come back, help as mentor, and welcome him to the events. so far CST hasn‚Äôt agreed but they did discuss and CST did reply.

his PAP boss sued him then and he had to give up his house and car to pay the charges. he was again sued by GCT and LKY for questioning about the $$ with Suharto and that was when he became bankrupt. meanwhile, he was still active academically overseas, he writes books, papers, (mainly about democracy). i think that is how he and his family survives financially.

despite that, CSJ pushed the system by hosting rallies, have public talks etc but was stopped by police, fined and when he refused to pay the fine, jailed. mainly charged with doing so without a police permit or trespassing. he was painted as a crazy man but according to historian PJ Thum [in this video](https://youtu.be/r6tHY3BLPls), CSJ was completely working within the democratic system. 

imo i think CSJ is far sighted and wants to build the country from inside out. SDP‚Äôs policies focus on being strong internally, so we will gain credit over time externally. breaking away from how $$ is too important, we can rise above it and use $$ as a tool to propel us instead of running after $$ without an aim. like how Japanese have high sense of pride in their work (probably too much) that we all trust Japanese products and the demand of Japanese products become so high even if costs are high.

sorry for the lack of specifics as i read and watched many sources, remember the overall idea but not the specifics. information all available online. and this is my take of my understanding. hope it helps!",t3_hn28l7,08-07-2020

Honestly, Murali does a much better job - and is really on the ground much more often- than his predecessor. A lot of things in Bukit batok, basic ground level stuff like simple maintenance, simply went wrong under Murali's predecessor (whom was also PAP) . In that respect, in my opinion, the difference between Murali and his predecessor is like heaven and hell. So I would give A++ to Murali for community outreach, estate management of his constituency, grassroot relations. I say this with confidence because I know people whom are grassroot volunteers and the hard work and effort put in by Murali is very obvious. 

So those photos are really extreme exxagregration..... 

But.... my MP is virtually silent on national-level issues that concern me like excessive immigration, job discrimination resulting in PMETS becoming taxi drivers, etc. 

In that respect, I like my MP but really hate many of his party's policies. Whereas I deeply distrust CSJ, but like his party's manifesto.

[Example: Hougang always voted for WP Low Thia Khiang because he is Teochew and connects with the Teochew demographic that live there.](https://youtu.be/l4B-cjQK3w8) If PAP wanna win they have to field a Teochew who can speak dialect and connect with Hougang boomers.

The boomers are dying off. They won't be the voting base forever.

You are not wrong in that race can influence voting but you seem to be blowing it out of proportion. Nobody wanted a reserved election.
