SINGAPORE - The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) has set its sights on seven SMCs and eight GRCs at the next election, with party chief Tan Cheng Bock set to lead a team in West Coast GRC.

Speaking to The Straits Times after a party meeting on election plans on Wednesday night (March 18), PSP assistant secretary-general Leong Mun Wai said the party has identified 44 candidates, with another 13 in reserve, and is seeking to make its presence felt on its first electoral outing.

""We intend to field a sizeable contingent, but of course, the final outcome will depend on discussions with all the other parties. We are mindful that we are the newest party, so we seek the cooperation of all the other parties to come to an amicable arrangement,"" said Mr Leong, adding that Dr Tan will likely be fielded in West Coast GRC because of his past track record and the expectation of voters.

The GRC includes the Ayer Rajah ward, where the veteran politician was MP for 26 years.

However, this sets up a potential three-way contest in West Coast GRC as Reform Party chairman Andy Zhu has said his party will contest there to ""pick up where we left off"" from the last elections.

There are many other potential overlaps as PSP sets an ambitious target of contesting 15 constituencies: Jurong GRC, Chua Chu Kang GRC, Tanjong Pagar GRC, Jalan Besar GRC, Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, Nee Soon GRC, Sembawang GRC, Hong Kah North SMC, Yuhua SMC, Pioneer SMC, Radin Mas SMC, Kebun Baru SMC, Marymount SMC and Yio Chu Kang SMC.

The meeting was held via video conference in three venues - the party's headquarters in Bukit Timah, its office in Tannery Lane and secretary-general Dr Tan's house in Holland Grove.

Central Executive Committee members like Francis Yuen, assistant treasurer Hazel Poa and assistant secretary-general Leong Mun Wai were seen entering Dr Tan's house from about 7pm.

Earlier in the day, the party had posted a recruitment call on its Facebook page for polling agents and counting agents.

The recruitment is part of its preparations for the next general election, which it said ""could be any time soon"" following the release of the new electoral boundaries last Friday (March 13).

In its post, the party explained what those roles entailed, and added that training will be provided by the party.

A message from Mr Leong had gone out to members on Monday, saying that the party would aim to compete in at least one GRC in each of its four divisions and a few SMCs, ""subject to negotiation with other parties"".

""Let us stress that to be a candidate is not the only way to contribute to the party and the cause we are fighting for,"" he said in the message.

Political observer Felix Tan, an associate lecturer at SIM Global Education, said the party could be ""stretching itself too thinly"" in just its first electoral outing, especially since it still largely rests on the personality of Dr Tan Cheng Bock.

""We don't know how well voters will take to the other candidates running in the other constituencies,"" he said.

He said that West Coast GRC is the PSP's best chance of electoral success, because Dr Tan has a following with a loyal support group among the voters there.

""It would be a surprise if he didn't run there."""

I was at east coast park on saturday afternoon, and noticed that a number of shared bikes like ofo or obike etc being hoarded (e.g. parked near someone/a group of people), but whom have no intention of allowing others to unlock the bike.

My friend spotted a bike near a bench occupied by a man, and attempted asking him whether that bike was available.
However my friend was told that he was still using it, and said that the bike was still unlocked.

Others simply said that they are still using the bikes despite being at a group gathering and having no indication that they were going to use it anytime soon.

Anyone else noticed this irony of bike sharing, or is it just me?"

Since the LTA ban, a ton of them are going totally unused and popping up on carousell for like $1000 USD. Brand New ones in the US are $2800!

However shipping a scooter gets complicated since they're heavy, bulky, and their giant batteries aren't permitted on cargo planes as far as I know.

So, what are some shipping companies that can do stuff like this? And how much should I expect to pay? Like $600 USD?


Thanks r/Singapore

PS;I'm in talks with a fellow at a place called ScooterSG who does ship new scooters to the USA as a reseller, and claims they can ship one for $350 in 6 to 8 buisnesses days which seems unusually low...
