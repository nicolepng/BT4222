> The suspension will last until Dec 14.

> During this period, the Foot Locker outlet is not allowed to conduct physical retail activities but may continue to continue selling products online.

Im talking of upwards of hundreds of people queuing where social distancing is just no longer viable. To make matters worse? This same hundreds of people will all eventually touch the same finger print scanner with no form of decontaminating. I mean army personels are immune to covid right?",t3_k745k8,06-12-2020

It's possible that it's random. While incidents seem like they are happening all within a short period of time, it actually makes it more likely that it is in fact completely random.

Many people think that randomness is for incidents to be evenly spaced apart, but it's actually not random because the incidents form a nice pattern that you can predict. Once every year for example, is not random. It's like incidents are purposefully avoiding being too near to each other.

When the incidents are random, they are unpredictable. It is expected for some clumps of incidents to occur together within a short time, and also for long periods of no incidents to occur. It shows that there's no discernable pattern and they just occur whenever they do. [Some relevant wired article.](https://www.wired.com/2012/12/what-does-randomness-look-like/)

What nonsense is this?

Smokers needs to eat and shop too, and sometimes goes out on dates and movies too. You mean just because Orchard Road turning into smoke-free zone means they don't need to have a life?

These smokers have a choice. They can smoke before or after they go Orchard. Or best quit smoking. They shouldn't have even pick up the habit in the first place.


My opinions of smokers:

Why do we the majority who are non-smokers have to put up with these minority who chose to pick up such a bad habit that destroys their health and suffocates or influence the people around them?

I'm not suggesting that all smokers are inconsiderate. But sometimes for non-smokers to tolerate smokers, is like, imagine someone digs his nose, then stick his nose-shit on the chair because they think its cool and cannot kick the habit of not carrying tissue paper. And when you sit on the chair they think you shouldn't complain because the nose shit will dry up and fade away and that they never even stick the nose shit on you at the first place.

Peer pressure, stress, trying to look cool, addiction are just excuses for picking up and not letting go of the habit.",t3_a1c982,29-11-2018

It is usually recommended as a last resort due to the amount of resources that could be drained from your business. Depending on the severity of the remarks, it may be a criminal or civil proceeding.

I guess the 2 star review fits the criteria of the 2nd one? SSA's isn't very detailed. Though if they really suffered damage in sales it's most likely due to their handling of a bad review lol so they're just further digging their own grave. I guess if anyone else is bored they can try to make sense of this

Okay so singaporelaw's website is back up. It's pretty long, so pasting just this part:

> 21.7.5A statement is defamatory in nature if it tends to (i) lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally, or (ii) cause the plaintiff to be shunned or avoided; or (iii) expose the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or ridicule.

Suing your customers for bad reviews have a chilling effect and will alienate you from the rest of your entire customer base. Having 100% good reviews is a sign of inaccuracy as nothing is 100%. Your food will never suit the taste of everybody in the world. Therefore, having some bad reviews sometimes have an opposite effect. E.g. ""This shop's food is so sweet, I feel like I will get diabetes from eating it."" can be treated as a good review by sweet-tooth enthusiasts even though it sounds like a bad review.

On the other hand... if there are idiots out to get your shop and purposely leave bad reviews, how do you combat them? Let's construct a purely hypothetical scenario.

> Instead, fireworks will be set off from different heartland locations across Singapore, bringing the countdown experience closer to Singaporeans at home.

> ""We urge Singaporeans to enjoy the heartland fireworks, the Marina Bay Shine a Light display and Share the Moment light projections online and on Mediacorp Channel 5 in the comfort of their homes,"" MSE said.

> ""Singaporeans are also encouraged to join in the community year-end countdown programmes online.""

> Safe management and crowd control measures will be in place at the fireworks sites to ensure public safety, and safe distancing ambassadors will be deployed to remind members of the public not to gather at the respective sites, the ministry said.

> ""We urge Singaporeans to practise social responsibility and cooperate with our officers to ensure the continued safety and well-being of the community,"" MSE added.

> SINGAPORE - Authorities are investigating shoe retailer Foot Locker, following large crowds that gathered on Friday evening outside its Orchard Gateway @ Emerald outlet.

> The Singapore Tourism Board said early Saturday (Dec 5) morning that investigations are under way, as Foot Locker stores have continued to hold events that draw large crowds, despite repeated advisories about crowd management.

> On Friday night, crowds had gathered at its Orchard outlet, apparently for Saturday's release of limited edition Adidas sneakers, which can fetch a tidy profit on the secondary market due to high demand.

> Eyewitnesses saw at least four red Police Tactical Unit anti-riot trucks parked outside 313@somerset mall, and police tape used to cordon off shop fronts. Police officers were also seen dispersing the crowd, which consisted mainly of youths.

> Photos that circulated on social media at about 8pm showed a crowd of around 100 people packed shoulder to shoulder outside the footwear store.

> The crowds were dispersed shortly after 8.30pm after safe distancing ambassadors and police officers arrived, STB said in a statement.

> ""STB takes a serious view of any breach in safe management measures, and will not hesitate to take actions against individuals and businesses that do not comply with them,"" said STB's director for safe management operations Ms Ranita Sundramoorthy.

> Adidas' Yeezy sneaker line, the product of a collaboration between rapper Kanye West and the sports shoe brand, has drawn large crowds in Singapore and abroad during past launches.

> Last June, the launch of the limited edition Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V created a long queue many hours before the release time at Foot Locker's Jewel Changi Airport outlet.

> Sole Superior Singapore, a sneaker and streetwear community, called on Foot Locker to shift to a contactless system for ""hyped"" - or very popular - releases, and that a traditional queue system ""is not the way during such dangerous times"".

> ""All we need is just one case to create a cluster,"" it said on Facebook. ""Then, inevitably, the public will look at the streetwear community in general in disgust.""

> Adidas Singapore had held an online ballot for Saturday's limited release shoes, but many sneaker aficionados who missed out appeared to have been trying their luck at Foot Locker given the high resale value of the shoes.

> ""These trainers are hot - the hype is real...Foot Locker is at the head of the latest trends, so you know it'll stock Yeezy boost trainers online and in select stores,"" it said on its website prior to the launch.

> The Foot Locker Singapore website was down as of Friday evening.

> Netizens took to social media to voice their displeasure at the lack of social distancing among the crowd.

> Former NMP Siew Kum Hong shared pictures of those gathered outside Foot Locker on his Facebook on Friday with the caption: ""Few cases does not mean no cases.""

> Under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament in April, those found flouting safe management measures face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Repeat offenders can be fined up to S$20,000, jailed for up to one year, or both.

They're still a fair bit cheaper than higher-tier restaurant burgers, where you're paying both for fancier burgs and the dining environment.

The primary reason is rather simple. Its a base human urge and there must be an outlet. If the state does not control it, some unsavoury characters will and exploit the women in the trade. The policy covers which parts of Singapore and which establishments can. It also support our tourist and our location as a regional hub. In the 70s, when we wanted to attract Japanese factories and business to Jurong Industrial Estate, permission was given by cabinet for a string of Japanese nite spots mostly along cuppage vicinity for Japanese executives and believe me any thing goes. These Japanese factories helped provide jobs for our grandparents and parents and made us what we are. 

Grand Hyatt has long history of patronage from a number of Malaysian Royal families. They would come down for the usual medical and dental checks at the old Tanglin Shopping centre ( first private medical hub) during the day and then proceed for nightly entertainment. Now its Mt E and but its still the Grand Hyatt. Notice that it also has full hawker fare. 

Lido is the apex for high end Singapore and Indonesian Chinese towkays and you will never find out who the ultimate beneficial owner for this joint. Event the service staff have no clue.

1259,9,gkp56lq,t3_l4cjme,"This group has been identified as the Zouk family. 

This family was supposedly founded by a female that's believed to be from the Bishan family, and a lone male that's suspected to be from the Marina family. Previously, he had been seen in various areas around town, like the Botanic Gardens, Tanglin, Orchard, and Kim Seng. So they're already a lot more urbanised compared to other clans living in other parts of Singapore.

They're known as the Zouk family because the first litter of pups was born along the Singapore River, near Jiak Kim Bridge, at the end of 2018. This group, comprising the parents ('Zouk Mum' and 'Zouk Dad'), 3 pups, and an adult female that's believed to be the mother's sister ('Zouk Aunt'), were eventually driven away from the area in May 2019 by the Bishan family, popped up along [Bukit Timah Road](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/otters-spotted-at-bukit-timah-group-fled-from-singapore-river-home-due-to-bishan-otters) and Alexandra Canal, then returned to the Singapore River for a while.

In June 2019, they [stopped traffic in the CBD](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/family-otters-attempt-cross-road-central-business-district), then fled to Rochor Canal. After that incident, the Zouk family was found along Bukit Timah Road. Zouk Mum was wounded, but was still active enough that she eluded a rescue attempt, and Zouk Aunt was missing. It's not known whether the group had been attacked by a rival family, or if there was some internal conflict, but as the remaining 5 members of the Zouk family continued wandering about places like Rochor Canal, Singapore River, and the Botanic Gardens, a lone female otter with injuries was seen along the Bukit Timah and Alexandra Canals, and subsequently identified as the missing Zouk Aunt. She paired up with a lone male, and eventually recovered. A few months later, Zouk Aunt finally crossed paths with the rest of the Zouk family along the Singapore River, but it was not a happy reunion. There was a fight between her and her sister, and she was driven away. So the former Zouk Aunt and her partner have been keeping to themselves, mostly staying out of the way of the other families; one possible encounter was in May 2020, when u/hanamihoshi saw [a pair of otters in Kallang](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/grkeoh/happy_world_otter_day_heres_a_video_of_2_cheeky/). 

At the end of 2019, the rest of the Zouk family made a den in the Botanic Gardens, and had a second litter. 6 pups were born, but 3 pups died from malnourishment. Subsequently, as the remaining pups grew up, the Zouk family started wandering out of the Botanic Gardens, and another young pup went missing. This family of 7 was seen in more areas; for example, the otters seen by u/SleeplessAtHome [doing laps in the pool at Park Infinia](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ff8d6n/otters_invade_condo_steal_koi_fish_bring_to_pool/) were identified as the Zouk family, and they were spotted at nearby [Tan Tock Seng Hospital](https://mothership.sg/2020/03/otters-tan-tock-seng-hospital/). During the circuit breaker, the Zouk otters made notable appearances at the [Shell station along Bukit Timah Road](https://mothership.sg/2020/04/otters-bukit-timah-shell-station/), [KK Hospital](https://mothership.sg/2020/05/otter-kk-womens-childrens-hospital/), and [Little India](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/family-of-otters-frolicking-outside-mustafa-centre-is-looking-for-a-permanent-home). They travelled up to Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, [fought the Marina otters](https://mothership.sg/2020/05/otters-fight-bishan-ang-mo-kio-park/), and possibly [raided the ponds at Jazreel Low's spa](https://www.todayonline.com/8days/sceneandheard/celebrities/former-actress-jazreel-low-doesnt-want-otters-ate-over-100-her) there. After the circuit breaker, u/blackchilli saw them [outside Plaza Singapura](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hdl50l/otters_at_plaza_singapura/) in June, and PM Lee wrote [about otters at the Istana](https://mothership.sg/2020/06/pm-lee-otters-istana/) - turns out that it was the Zouk family.

By the end of 2020, they were back at the Botanic Gardens, and had a 3rd litter of 7 pups. And now they're venturing out of the gardens again, exploring the rest of their territory; they've popped up at Dempsey, Queensway, [Penang Road](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/otterly-delightful-surprise-for-office-workers-at-penang-road), and as this video shows, went to the Istana again. Right now they're back at the Singapore River.

While the Bishan family has been the most famous family for several years, right now it seems that the Zouk family has been getting the most public attention as they try to navigate the city.",t3_l4cjme,25-01-2021

> A nerve-racking video showing a family of otters trying to cross the busy Orchard Road outside of Plaza Singapura has been put up on Facebook on Jan. 24, 2020.

> The incident took place along the busy road outside Plaza Singapura, with the otters gathered at the pavement opposite the entrance of the Istana.

> The otters, which were squeaking, were repeatedly trying to make their way across the four-lane road, which was experiencing moderate traffic at that time.

> At least two otters tried leading the pack to make a run for it across the road, but they turned around at the last second as vehicles approached and cut off their path.

> The presence of the large otter family forced vehicles travelling along the road at that time to slow down or change lanes to avoid hitting the animals.

> Located at blind spot

> As the otters made their way across the road gingerly, they were not completely visible to motorists in approaching vehicles the on left-most lanes as the animals were located at a blind spot.

> The heart-stopping moment occurred when the pack leader was almost done crossing the four-lane road, when a speeding taxi braked in time to avoid running the creatures over.

> This occurred within seconds after the pack leader took the chance to make a run for it when there was a split-second lull in traffic.

> Onlookers at the side of the road could only look on helplessly.

> There were at least 14 otters in the group.

> The video ended with the otters safely at the grass patch outside of the Istana.

SINGAPORE - Just two days after a massive breakdown crippled the North-South, East-West and Circle lines, a fire broke out in a train tunnel between Orchard and Somerset stations early on Friday (Oct 16) soon after operating hours ended.

The incident took place when an engineering locomotive ‚Äì used for hauling heavy equipment for after-hours maintenance - caught fire.

Soon, thick smoke engulfed the tunnel, according to a source. ""Workers were running for their lives,"" he said.

Two workers at the site were taken to hospital for smoke inhalation.

The Singapore Civil Defence Force said it received a call at 12.45am on Friday about a fire at Somerset MRT station. ""The fire involved the engine compartment of a locomotive train,"" said an SCDF spokesman.

""SMRT staff extinguished the fire using four extinguishers prior to SCDF's arrival.

""SCDF conveyed two persons to Singapore General Hospital for smoke inhalation. The cause of fire is under investigation.""

SMRT has not responded to queries from The Straits Times at the time of writing.

This was not the first time tunnel fires have broken out in MRT stations. In October 2017, a fire was spotted in a tunnel between Marina Bay and Raffles Place stations, on the same day the Bishan tunnels were flooded.

In November 2015, an electrical fire happened just before 6am on the North-South Line.

In that same year, a circuit-breaker fire shut down the Bukit Panjang LRT system for a day.

In 2013, a short-circuit fire broke out near Newton, engulfing the station in smoke and disrupting service for two hours in the morning peak.

In 2004, a fire broke out in the tunnel near Newton, apparently also caused by a short circuit.",t3_jc7ezq,16-10-2020

Nondescript is right.

In fact nondescript made the previous building so much less obtrusive and unpretentious, just as Holland v shopping center is, harmonious to the HV street character. The windmill was a whimsical add on, which wasn‚Äôt key to the equation. It did however play into the experience and memory of some people.

This current one must have cost a lot effort and money to build, an attempt at futuristic expression,  tries hard to stand out, an egoistical  object. Whoever made those decisions did not consider what made Holland village special to people, it‚Äôs the interesting terrain, interesting mix  of shops, against a backdrop of Low-rise nondescript buildings that flowed with the gentle rise and fall of the terrain. 

If we keep at this developer addiction of building unnecessary frivolous ‚Äòiconic‚Äô looking buildings for every plot of land there, it will become a showroom of architectural fetish, and what made Holland v special to most people before  will likely fade.

> The apology is directed not only at Celena Ho ‚Äî the customer involved ‚Äî but also to the public:

It's annoying and crazy, yes. But what legal compensation? On what grounds? (Mental stress ah?)

But how is this gonna hold up in court? And also who's gonna pay to fight in court over internet words. 

I just think it's impractical and won't amount to anything for both sides to use law as a threat.

Unless somehow Sara is spam calling her 20 times a day, threatening her, legit causing fear and affecting celena's quality of life. And it has to be a police case first.

Also celena sent a lawyer letter? I thought she wrote a public lawyer-like fb response.

Harassment act states threatening and abusive words or behaviour, warranting a police case as it's a criminal offense. *I don't think this amounts to criminal*

Let me make this clear ah. I think Sara is hella stupid. Shooting her company in the face and being all cray cray.

How is this embarrassing? Just like you, I have a screen protecting me.

>I guess either you or your mother are one of the working ladies at Orchard Towers given how defensive you are of them.

Well - whether it is myself, my mother, or anyone else related to me who works in the sex industry (by choice or not) isn't your business, just like how - what car you drive, which brand of raw jeans you have, which CCA's you took at NUS is none of anybody's business. In my experience, people usually stereotype things after a bad experience. So maybe you just have been unlucky to be ""offered"" the loose women you hired.

>Oh. Didn't know you prefer being a bottom. ;)

Yeap I love being the bottom! I'm surprised you have never heard of cowgirl/boy seeing as how you ""know that your penis isn't small given the average size of Asian men."" You should try it if you ever get the chance to.

**Adding on:** for the men reading this who are concerned about the size of their package - sometimes a switch up in position, or a different skillset with a different part of your own body like your *tongue*, *finger(s)*, *or anything else your partner feels daring enough to try*, is more interesting in bed (or wherever floats your boat)

1683,9,etq9pvi,t3_ccy6ts,"Orchard Towers has been designated for the very purpose it is in long time ago by the authorities. It‚Äôs to help attract foreign talent and investment. Businessmen and investors are not monks. Very reason why Dubai has a vibrant nightlife despite the mosques blaring calls to prayers 5 times a day. 

Before Orchard Towers, that side of the strip of Orchard Rd from Thai Embassy to Orchard Hotel had a string of raunchy bars catering to western foreigners opening factories in Jurong and Banks on CBD and to the 7th fleet. Loyang oil supply base would be quite different if riggers can‚Äôt find R&R before their next assignment. Ever heard a major port that does not cater to sailors. The same owners and their families have moved to Orchard Towers. 

Many of the outlets were previously (maybe still) owned by a hardworking couple who previously worked in supplying renovation materials. The wife was serving drinks at the bar and then moved on to open other outlets. 

The Police in the past had the zone closed to SS gangs for decades. Every bar owners knows who his Police contact is in time of trouble. I wonder who dropped the ball. 

The tenants and owners of units are fully aware of what is going on from day 1. So not sure why they are spinning this as a normal neighbourhood. 

I can‚Äôt find the source but LKY did explain once why the 4 floors of whores are needed. Must check his memoirs.

> From family mall to sleaze and brawls

> From kueh and fashion to booze, sex and brawls

> A family-oriented mall in its early days, it is now notorious for vice activities

> By day, workers throng the small offices on the upper floors of dingy Orchard Towers, with patrons occasionally streaming in for cheap Thai food.

> But, after dark, the place is transformed, buzzing with sex workers and drunks.

> Loud music begins to blare from a string of nightclubs from as early as 7pm, and scantily clad foreign women ‚Äì some of whom are from Eastern Europe and claiming to be students ‚Äì emerge from the establishments and engage in light banter with passing men.

> Nearby, smokers are puffing away indoors, seemingly unaware of the many fires that have plagued the mall in the past.

> Behind darkened windows of seedy massage parlours ‚Äì masquerading as beauty salons ‚Äì are women who think nothing of tugging passers-by to lure them in for some ‚Äúfun‚Äù.

> And, just outside the complex, some 20 streetwalkers, many of whom are in Singapore on social visit passes, solicit tourists for sex, with their pimps keeping a close watch on proceedings nearby.

> As the night wears on, men, clearly drunk, lie slumped on the steps even as scuffles break out around them. Catfights among the women, which may progress to hitting one another with their highheeled shoes over customers, are also not uncommon.

> The complex is a notorious place and is in the spotlight again after a 31-year-old man was murdered in a brawl earlier this month.

> A check has found more than 40 incidents in Orchard Towers, including murders, fights, theft, molestation and fires reported in newspapers over the years.

> When The Sunday Times visited the mall a week after the latest incident, nothing much had changed for those who worked at the landmark once tagged as the ‚ÄúFour Floors of Whores‚Äù by travel guide Lonely Planet because of the number of shady massage parlours and nightclubs. There are more than 40 such establishments in the building.

> The bottom five floors of the 18-storey building house commercial units, with the rest taken up by office space. There is also a residential block at the rear.

> Some tenants gave a conservative estimate of at least one fight per week at Orchard Towers, which is notorious for vice activities.

> A tenant, who provides alteration services, said: ‚ÄúPeople continued their activities like nothing happened.‚Äù

> FAMILY-FRIENDLY MALL

> But it was not always like this.

> Orchard Towers was once a family-oriented destination with a variety of shops ranging from florists and tailors to electronics stores and restaurants.

> In the early years, there was even a cinema on the fourth floor. In the 1980s, nightclubs and massage parlours began popping up beside the electronics shops and tailors.

> By the 2000s, many more of such sleazy joints were established, mostly because of the low rental and lack of quality control. Even the residential block at the back is not spared, with the ‚Äúworking girls‚Äù moving into the apartments.

> One retailer is paying about $4,000 a month for his shop space, less than half what it would have cost him for equivalent space in other buildings in the vicinity.

> But massage parlours and nightclubs usually offer the owners even more than market rate for rents because they say the location tends to attract ‚Äúhigh-class‚Äù clientele.

> A property agent said: ‚ÄúWhen someone offers you so much money for a shop space that nobody wants, you would find it hard to say ‚Äòno‚Äô.‚Äù

> Another big reason for the lessthan-ideal mix of tenants is the unsavoury reputation of the building.

> ‚ÄúNo other businesses want to rent the shop spaces. They are left empty for years,‚Äù the agent said. ‚ÄúThere are no takers, even after reducing the rent to about $1,000 for some units.‚Äù

> A walk around the mall found more than 20 empty shops.

> SLEAZE PARADISE

> Over a few nights last week, The Sunday Times had a close-up look at what happens at the complex.

> ‚ÄúAction‚Äù starts as early as 7pm, with girls filing into the mall. They come mainly from Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam and Eastern Europe.

> By 1am, the place is packed, with heavily made-up hostesses congregating near escalators and ushering patrons to their clubs, some of which boast live cover bands. The customers are typically middleaged foreign men, who are either alone or in small groups.

> The girls badger them to buy drinks, hoping for the 30 per cent commission they get for every glass. Some also offer sex for a price.

> ‚ÄúNo one wants to do this forever. We just want to earn enough and leave,‚Äù said a Taiwanese masseuse, a mother of one, who has to dole out a share of her daily earnings to her ‚Äúboss‚Äù.

> ‚ÄúSometimes we choose our customers. If we see drunk men or those who look like they can‚Äôt pay, we won‚Äôt choose them.‚Äù

> Outside the mall, streetwalkers, including transsexuals, prowl the sidewalks for customers.

> ‚ÄúThese girls are daring. One held my arm, and told me to take her home for $300,‚Äù said Mr Taka, a Japanese expatriate.

> BAD REPUTATION AFFECTING RESIDENTS AND SHOPS

> The sleaze has affected those not in that business at Orchard Towers.

> One retailer said he shuts his shop by 8pm, earlier than he would like to, due to the nocturnal activities. Some female office workers said they also try to leave before 7pm to avoid being mistaken for a prostitute.

> Several businesses have appealed to the management on issues such as brawls and loud music.

> ‚ÄúBut nothing has changed,‚Äù said a money changer, who leaves the building at around 7pm. ‚ÄúThere are no rules here. I try to leave this building before the ‚Äòdevils‚Äô come,‚Äù he said.

> When asked about the closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in his shop ‚Äì he has more than five ‚Äì he said: ‚ÄúEvery shop will have a few cameras, just to be safe.‚Äù

> A salon owner, who has been in the building for 40 years before shutting her business two months ago, said customers were afraid to come because they would be approached.

> ‚ÄúEven men are scared to come, because they had been harassed by ladies from the sleazy joints,‚Äù said the woman, who is in her 70s.

> Some patrons, however, remain unfazed by the mall‚Äôs bad reputation. British tourist Danny, who was accosted by four women last Thursday, said: ‚ÄúEveryone has been telling me the ‚Äòfour floors‚Äô are a must-see attraction. It is shocking since Singapore has a clean image.‚Äù

> A regular patron, who wanted to be known only as Mr Chan, added that he has seen ‚Äúcountless‚Äù fights in the mall. ‚ÄúAs long as you don‚Äôt bother, you will be fine.‚Äù

> Many residents, too, it would appear, are wary about moving even though they are unhappy about some of their neighbours.

> ‚ÄúYou see different faces daily,‚Äù said a 73-year-old, who has lived in the building for more than 20 years.

> Residents said they would have no problems selling their units because the building, on the corner of Claymore and Orchard roads, is in Singapore‚Äôs prime shopping district.

> Yet, many refuse to do so due to the convenience.

> ADDRESSING THE ISSUES

> An MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC, Mr Melvin Yong, said his constituency has received occasional feedback from some Orchard Towers residents about issues such as illegal parking, noise pollution, littering and fights.

> It has been working closely with agencies to address the feedback.

> The police, for instance, has increased the deployment of uniformed officers at the mall every night, he added.

> ‚ÄúBesides conducting regular crime-control operations at the public entertainment outlets and massage establishments, police have also stopped granting new massage establishment licences for Orchard Towers.‚Äù

> Over the years, more CCTV cameras have also been deployed at Orchard Towers and its vicinity.

> Mr Yong said there is regular engagement with the stakeholders, including the building‚Äôs tenants, on the area‚Äôs safety and security measures, and to address public disamenities surfaced by the residents.

> ‚ÄúOne challenge we face is the transient visitors to the area,‚Äù he added. ‚Äú(Thus), the engagement efforts cannot be one-off and need to be sustainable.‚Äù

When redevelopment began at the old strip of bars at Orchard Road serving foreigners, one of the best know bars was located at No. 392, Orchard Road. The bar was called Club 392. The authorities worked with the developers at No. 400 Orchard Road to take on the bars and maintain it as the drawcard. Club 392 and a number of these bars moved to the new building at 400 Orchard Road now called Orchard Towers. Club 392 is now Queens Disco.

Even in those days, security was tight. As it was frequented by western foreigners and members of NZ army which had an entire battalion stationed here, it was patrolled by their MPs and we stepped aside as the agreement was that we would not arrest them. When the 7th fleet sailed in, the US Navy Shore Patrol took over security. All the bars had the contact numbers of NZ Army and US Navy to contact at the first sign of trouble. And they were dead scared when the calvary turned up and a bashing was expected before getting thrown into the Brig. . 

In the 80s and 90s, more locals began to frequent with the likes of Top Ten and Celebrities. Even then you could not spot a single tattooed Ah Beng or Ah Lian. Partly  due to withdrawal of NZ SEA forces and US Navy's lost of Subic bay and their relocation to Japan. 

Prior to the 80s, Singaporeans would patronise outlets on the opposite side of the road - Tania at Peebles Bar, Forum Hotel, Tanglin Shopping Centre, etc. Even then careful planning was done to separate the locals from foreigners. 

The god in all this was MHA and their proxy was the Police Licensing Department. Too many fights, bouncer trouble, patron assaulted, and owners would be called up.

> SINGAPORE: A young man who kicked a screen door at a train platform, shattering it, was sentenced to nine months' probation on Wednesday (Jul 17).

> Mohamad Adib Azfar Mohamad, 19, has to remain indoors from 10pm to 6am for nine months and perform 60 hours of community service.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He pleaded guilty to one charge of mischief resulting in damages worth more than S$500.

> He had been at Orchard MRT Station with his colleagues on Sep 24 last year when the train arrived.

> Adib had been playing around with his colleagues and wanted to prevent one of them from boarding the train, but failed to do so.

> After the train doors closed behind his colleague, Adib ran towards the platform screen doors, jumped, and kicked the door forcefully with his right leg.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The door shattered as a result and Adib immediately left the station, taking a cab home.

> District Judge Eddy Tham had previously adjourned sentencing after calling for a probation suitability report and asking Adib to consider what to do about the damages.

> The repairs had cost the Land Transport Authority S$3,061.

> The court heard on Wednesday that the report ordered by the judge had recommended probation.

> ""The accused's mother had made full restitution,"" said the prosecutor.

> The judge had previously asked Adib why he did ""such a stupid thing"" and said: ""Probation has been recommended for you. It means if you comply with the terms of probation, not only will you have a chance to benefit from the programmes and counselling provided to you, you will have a clean record.""

> He added that if Adib failed to abide by the probation terms and committed a similar offence, he would be taken back to court and sentenced afresh.

> Adib's mother furnished a bond of S$5,000 to ensure her son's good behaviour during probation.

> The punishment for committing an act of mischief that causes losses or damages of S$500 or more is a maximum jail term of two years, a fine or both.

Which is exactly my point. Just because their birth cert is a certain religion and that certain religion has certain prohibitions, that doesn't automatically mean that the person would adhere to it and abstain from it. Yes you're *supposed to* but it doesn't automatically mean that you *will.* Especially now where there is a rising number if people being atheist.

They refer to these as asymptomatic cases, but I further wonder if it's possible to be exposed in a way that doesn't even count as asymptomatic infection i.e. there's undetectable viral load on a nasal swab. It's definitely possible in theory, since vaccinations are designed to do that. Maybe the workers were exposed to dead virus, or they ingested the virus instead of inhaling it, so their stomach acid killed it. Or there's a Goldilocks dose that isn't infectious but can induce antibodies. 

One hypothetical scenario is that after an infected guest checks out, hotel staff push in a UV disinfection machine and turn it on. Then they go in to vacuum and change the bedding and what not, during which time they inhale UV-killed virus and develop antibodies.",t3_khes59,22-12-2020

> Tan Sen Yang, the sole suspect facing a murder charge in the Orchard Towers murder, will be tried in the High Court, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) said in a press release on Oct. 20.

> In addition, the AGC said it was keen to clarify the various queries it received regarding the charges against the individuals involved in the case.

> The AGC had previously already issued a media statement condemning accusations of racial bias in sentencing as ""categorically false and baseless"".

> However, chatter online has been rampant regarding the sentencing of those involved.

> Tan Sen Yang is represented by lawyers Eugene Thuraisingam and Suang Wijaya, from Eugene Thuraisingam LLP.

> Why is Tan Sen Yang the sole suspect facing murder?

> Tan Sen Yang's charge is based on causing the death of Satheesh Noel s/o Gobidass by using a kerambit knife with the intention of causing multiple injuries to the victim‚Äôs head and neck area.

> Describing how the incident unfolded on July 2, the AGC summarised the prosecution's case as such:

> Initially, Tan Sen Yang had been drinking with his acquaintances at the Naughty Girl Club on the second floor of Orchard Towers.

> He was allegedly in possession of the kerambit knife at that time, which he supposedly placed on the table, resulting in his acquaintances seeing the weapon.

> Afterwards, they were confronted by the deceased while leaving the Naughty Girl Club.

> Tan Sen Yang, along with Ang Da Yuan, Natalie Siow Yu Zhen, Joel Tan Yun Sheng and the deceased ended up in a fight.

> Three other individuals ‚Äî Chan Jia Xing, Tan Hong Sheng and Loo Boon Chong ‚Äî were also at the scene of the fight. However, they either did not participate or tried to stop the fight.

> Eventually, the victim passed away from his knife injuries.

> How were the others charged and why were they given their respective sentences?

> The AGC provided the reasoning behind the charges for the other six suspects:

> Ang Da Yuan, Natalie Siow and Joel Tan

> For these three individuals, the AGC noted that they had admitted to kicking and punching the deceased during the fight.

> All three were charged with voluntary causing hurt with common intention.

> However, there was no plan to assault him nor did they know that Tan Sen Yang would use the knife during the fight.

> Their acts were noted to have resulted in two abrasions on the deceased's upper body which were minor and non-fatal in nature.

> However, on account of group violence, and the presence of many members of public during the fight, a month's imprisonment was sought for Siow and Joel Tan, while two months was sought for Ang as he had violent antecedents.

> In addition, both Siow and Ang were also aware of Tan Sen Yang's possession of the weapon, and remained in his company in spite of it.

> The two, therefore, received an additional charge of consorting with a person carrying an offensive weapon in a public place.

> The prosecution had sought a sentence of six months and six strokes of the cane for Ang, and an imprisonment term of nine months for Siow, uplifted from six months as she cannot be caned.

> Ang was subsequently sentenced to eight months‚Äô imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, while Siow was sentenced to five months‚Äô imprisonment on top of the 107 days (around three-and-a-half months) which she had earlier spent in remand.

> Meanwhile, Joel Tan was sentenced to a month's imprisonment.

> Tan Hong Sheng, Loo Boon Chong and Chan Jia Xing

> In the meantime, the cases of both Tan Hong Sheng and Loo remain before the court.

> Tan Hong Sheng faces a charge of consorting with a person carrying an offensive weapon in a public place.

> Loo also faces one charge of consorting with a person carrying an offensive weapon in a public place, and another charge of perverting the course of justice.

> As for Chan, he has been given a 12-month conditional warning for his charge of consorting with a person carrying an offensive weapon in a public place.

> The AGC noted that he had tried to stop the attack on the deceased, and also cooperated with police investigations.

> The charge against Chan may be revived should he re-offend within the 12-month period.

> Totally unrelated but follow and listen to our podcast here

Total for Ang:

> two months (for voluntary causing hurt with common intention) + six months and six strokes of the cane (for consorting with a person carrying an offensive weapon in a public place) = eight months‚Äô imprisonment and six strokes of the cane (sentence given as sought by prosecution)

Total for Siow:
> one month (for voluntary causing hurt with common intention) + nine months (for consorting with a person carrying an offensive weapon in a public place) = 10 months' imprisonment (total sought by prosecution) vs 8.5 months (five months' imprisonment + 107 days in remand) that she was eventually sentenced to.

1913,9,eteuxyu,t1_eteik63,"Yeah a clean cut to the throat is normally done by one single person. Unless it was premeditated by the group and they were helping each other to commit the crime for e.g some are immobilising the victim while his throat was being slit while the others know what was going on, and was there to prevent the murder from failing. In that case all of them are guilty.

Also, while it is reasonable to want to think the better of humanity and believe that only one of the group members was responsible for the murder, it is entirely possible everyone of them had the intention for the murder. 

An individual's morality can be warped under the influence of group-think and the group of 8 members now function as one single thought entity instead of 8 independent minds. There were famous psychological experiments in the past such as the Milgram experiment and Stanford prison experiment that illustrates this. All it takes is an authority figure in the group whose morality is unquestionable by every other member of the group and they wouldn't even think what they are committing was a seriously immoral crime.

> If convicted, they could face the death penalty.

> All eight suspects were arrested within 12 hours of the attack, which took place early Tuesday morning.

> Chinese-language paper Lianhe Wanbao reported the victim's name as Mr Satheesh Noel.

> He is believed to have been wounded in the brawl that reportedly started inside Naughty Girl Club on the second storey of Orchard Towers and continued to the floor below, witnesses told reporters.

> Shin Min Daily News also spoke to Mr Satheesh's former colleague, Mr Alep, who wanted to be known only by his first name.

> According to him, the Singaporean was a mechanic.

> Mr Alep said: ""After he left the company, we didn't speak much but I know he got married and had a five-year-old daughter.""

> ""When I heard the news of the murder, I didn't know it was him until my friends told me. I am sad and am sorry for his family,"" he added.

> Shin Min understands that Mr Satheesh was a regular at the Naughty Girl Club.

> In close-circuit TV footage from one of the shops circulating online, a group of about 10 people is seen intercepting the victim at the escalator leading to the building's entrance at 6.12am.

> One of the assailants, who was brandishing a weapon, then threatens the victim and forces him back.

> Seconds later, the group flees the scene and the victim is seen staggering before collapsing at the entrance.

> Shin Min reported that one of the assailants slit the victim's throat with a knife.

> In another online video, a paramedic can be seen performing chest compressions on the victim.

> When a Wanbao reporter visited Naughty Girl Club on Tuesday night, it was open as usual.

> Kiranpal Singh, 32, and Harrymeet Singh, 31, both pleaded guilty on Tuesday (April 2) to attempting¬†to intimidate two enforcement officers who were carrying out their duties.

> Kiranpal Singh pleaded guilty to one charge of using criminal force on an officer and a second charge of obstructing a public servant from carrying out his duties.

> Harrymeet Singh admitted¬†to one charge of using abusive and threatening words on a public servant.

> The court heard that both men were at the Naughty Girl club in Orchard Towers in the early hours of April 1 last year.

> At about 7.30am, the duo decided to step out of the club to smoke at a staircase landing. Twenty minutes later, they were approached by¬†two enforcement officers from the National Environment Agency (NEA) and Certis Cisco Security.

> As Harrymeet Singh was still smoking, Mr Yap Kwai Chung, the NEA officer, approached him and identified himself.

> He told Harrymeet Singh that he was not supposed to smoke in the building and asked for his particulars.

> Harrymeet Singh ignored him and tried¬†to return to the club, but was denied entry by the bouncer after the officers told him about what had transpired.

> At this point, Harrymeet Singh‚Äôs friend, Mr Harish Kumar, and Kiranpal Singh‚Äôs fiancee arrived at the scene to find out what was happening.

> Kiranpal Singh then told Harrymeet Singh to ignore the officers and pulled him away, but the enforcement officers followed them.

> Mr Yap then instructed his partner, Mr Khor Jia Min, to inform the police of the men‚Äôs uncooperative behaviour.

> Harrymeet Singh was eventually stopped by the enforcement officers around Claymore Road. Harish¬†began questioning Mr Yap about which division he was from, while Kiranpal Singh pulled Harrymeet Singh away from the officers.

> Mr Khor warned Kiranpal Singh not to do that again, but the latter responded by using his chest to push the officer.

> ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do? You don‚Äôt threaten me,‚Äù Kiranpal Singh was heard to have said.

> He pushed Mr Khor backwards with his chest again while repeatedly shouting the same words.

> Despite being told to calm down by Mr Yap, Kiranpal Singh insisted that Mr Khor had threatened him.

> Kiranpal Singh then pulled Harrymeet Singh away again,¬†exclaiming that he was a ‚Äúbig four auditor‚Äù and told Mr Khor to ‚Äúget a job‚Äù.

> A crowd then started to gather around the pair as they tried¬†to escape the officers.

> At one point, Harrymeet Singh began hurling obscenities at Mr Yap and even threatened to kill him.

> Harish began recording a video of Mr Yap at this point and directed a derogatory remark at Mr Khor.

> Kiranpal Singh and Harrymeet Singh continued arguing with the enforcement officers even after the police arrived.

> Kiranpal Singh could be jailed¬†up to three months and/or fined up to S$1,500 for using criminal force on the NEA officer. For preventing an officer from doing his duty, he could be jailed¬†three months and/or fined up to S$2,500.

> For using insulting and threatening words on a public servant, Harrymeet Singh could be fined up to S$5,000 and/or jailed¬†up to a year.

> Harish was fined S$2,500 for harassing the officers.

> As of April 1, enforcement has kicked in for those caught smoking outside Designated Smoking Areas in the Orchard Road precinct.

> He clarified that he was aware of that Orchard Road precinct has become a No Smoking Zone, and smokers would have to smoke at designated areas.

> Apparently, he said that he was fined for smoking with one foot outside of the demarcated box.

> Claiming to have not known about this rule, he supposedly told the enforcement officer that he would move inside the box.

> It appears that he was subsequently issued a fine of S$200 on April 7, 2019, at around 6pm:

> NEA‚Äôs response

> Responding to Mothership‚Äòs queries, NEA stated that they have reviewed the case and explained that their officers had ‚Äúobserved the male subject smoking outside of the DSA‚Äù.

> According to NEA, this was corroborated with video footage.

> In their statement, NEA clarified that:

> ‚ÄúEnforcement action will be taken as long as a smoker is seen to be holding a lit cigarette, or smoking outside of a DSA.‚Äù

> They also confirmed that the man was ticketed for standing along the boundary of the DSA, and stated that the enforcement officers were ‚Äúin line with (their) standard operating procedures‚Äù.

> Advertisement

> This is NEA‚Äôs statement in full:

> The National Environment Agency (NEA) has investigated the incident where a male subject claimed that he had been ticketed for standing along the boundary of the Designated Smoking Area (DSA) in the Orchard Road No Smoking Zone. NEA has reviewed the case and is satisfied that the actions taken by the enforcement officers were appropriate and in line with our standard operating procedures. Our officers had observed the male subject smoking outside of the DSA and approached him, and he was cooperative throughout the engagement. This is corroborated with video footage showing that the male subject was smoking and standing outside the DSA. Since 1 April 2019, NEA has started taking enforcement action at the Orchard Road No Smoking Zone. Enforcement action will be taken as long as a smoker is seen to be holding a lit cigarette, or smoking outside of a DSA. In situations where smokers see that there is insufficient space in the DSAs, they are advised to head to the next nearest DSA, or wait until there is sufficient space to move into the DSA. These are efforts that can be taken to reduce the exposure of second-hand smoke, and everyone can play a part by reminding smokers not to light up in smoking prohibited places, and to be socially responsible and considerate when smoking in public places.

While true, if the agc is considered bias, the court hands are tied if agc decides to bring a lower charge cause of said bias. So there's only so much a court can make a judgement based on the charge brought forward.

I.e. if a person was killed during a robbery but the agc only charge robber, its highly sus. But the court also cannot force agc to bring forward another charge right?

This holds true regardless of my personal take on whether there is contempt in the statements.

Now, I don't really know what is the ""aforementioned sentence"" you are referring to.

Contempt takes into consideration the full context of the post. And in the original post the comparison is being made between two different types of offences, which got different sentences and different media coverage, followed by a comment about whether a brown person would get the same media questions.

Conditional warnings, and the withdrawal of charges, are actions taken by AGC and not the court. On this basis alone, there is no contempt of court. It's simply a complaint about AGC (at worst), and there are no contempt laws preventing this.",t3_jmo19s,03-11-2020

> One taxi driver certainly experienced a rather amusing encounter recently.

> All coins

> On July 30, a cabbie surnamed Zaffre had picked up a young passenger from Orchard who was heading to Bukit Batok.

> Zaffre shared with Mothership that during the course of the trip, the ""teenage girl"" did not indicate whether she would be making payment with cash or card.

> Upon reaching the destination, she opted for cash to pay the S$17.20 taxi fare‚Äîbut not in the form of the notes that you might expect.

> Instead, the girl first handed him one 20 cents coin, followed by four paper packets of coins.

> Each packet had been stapled to seal it, and was labeled with the amount of money it contained.

> When questioned by Zaffre why she was paying the fare like this, the girl simply said that this was what she had.

> Took 10 minutes to count the coins

> Zaffre said that he initially felt annoyed and reluctant to accept the coins, as he was unable to count them at the moment.

> However, the girl apparently asked him to trust her that the amount was accurate.

> Zaffre said that he thought that perhaps the girl had taken the money from her piggy bank, and thus decided to give her the benefit of the doubt.

> Zaffre only managed to count the coins after work at home.

> It took him 10 minutes to do so, with the help of his daughter and son-in-law.

> Thankfully, the coins added up to S$17 like the girl had assured, despite two of the five cent coins being of China and Hong Kong currency.

> According to a Facebook post by Zaffre's daughter Liyanah, documenting the rather bizarre encounter, there were many five and 10 cent coins inside the packets.

> Liyanah added that although her father had been ""pissed"", she applauded the girl for being honest and for ""adding some humour to [their] lives"".

>	According to a Cornell University study by Justin J. Gunnell and Stephen J. Ceci, more attractive defendants are less likely to be found guilty than less attractive ones.

This unequal treatment does appear to be mitigated by the seriousness of the alleged offense, though: In cases involving the most serious offenses, and with strong evidence, the attractiveness bias was less pronounced. 

Jurors are like lay people (not professional judges), so, they are similar to people online judging about cases such as this one. Except, jurors have more access to evidences, making things be *far more pronounced* if we are looking at the common folk‚Äôs response.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Maybe you don‚Äôt, but there are certainly people who do find her attractive.

You are a Spanish expat according to yourself, and looking at how different cultures have different standards of beauty, your opinion of her being ‚Äúaverage‚Äù might not match that of Singaporeans, or even East Asians in general.

The standards of beauty can be vastly different. TBH, there are Asians who ridicule the looks of some south-east Asian gfs of Western expats, because stereotypically, many gfs of Western expats aren‚Äôt even good looking at all...

Maybe she is ‚Äúaverage‚Äù by Western standards, but I am sure she is ‚Äúabove average‚Äù at least by Singaporean standards.

What I am saying is that your ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù is not universal and I‚Äôm quite certain she is not not attractive.

Note: if you have no idea what EDMW is, it is an infamous Singaporean internet forum. They often have posts of women that are highly sexualised, so, to even pass ‚ÄúEDMW-standards‚Äù, I would expect that this lady in question would be reasonably attractive, at the very least.",t3_j8jy6e,11-10-2020

Plenty voiced out their disapproval of CC in his capacity as **then member** of the *Media Literacy Council* (irony). A police report was even made yet AGC shrugged it off though? Or how about Lam Pin Min's seditious comments during Thaipusam '15?

>Even the police doesn't have the right to be judge jury and executioner and some online Mob who doesn't have the full context of the situation ruining someone's life.

Your original comment lumped ALL forms of vigilantism in one basket yet now conveniently shifted the goalpost specifically to include those ""who doesn't have the full context of the situation...""?

Am I missing something here? Was there more context needed during the [Sim Lim Square HP incident](https://www.tnp.sg/news/others/sim-lim-shop-owner-cant-explain-why-he-paid-customers-1010-refund-coins) for netizens to call out an asshole? Was CASE even able to enact punishment of any sort AFTER the video was circulated for some time?

There's a clear precedent that various individuals in given positions of power and influence that are seemingly immune from repercussions.

It's unfair isn't it, if locals are held to higher standards but rejected at the door. Those so-called skills can only be demonstrated after the person is being hired and working in the job.

And it's harder to give an inept employee the boot once they are hired. It's very common to see people who can't do their job scope being dependent on others. 

Let's be frank. Most people want to protect their jobs and rice bowl, and at the same time, not work as a slave. This applies to both fts and locals. In the civil/public service too!

I mean, you are right and it's logical that incompetent people will be taken out naturally. But I don't think it's that clean in real life. It's messier. Look at SPH's CEO as mentioned. Connections rule.

The system is being gamed and exploited so that companies can bring in their staff from overseas, enjoy the security/tax/infrastructure here, without paying social costs. GDP goes up, bonuses for civil servants. Who bears these costs? Well, to put it bluntly, Sgrean males serving NS being paid below market rate.

Sacrifices of their time and lives. 

I guess real life is unfair. 

But there's also side effects: one of which is the low TFR here. 288 out of 288 countries. Who wants to have a child here? 

If we think of leaving behind a legacy, realistically, only politicians and elites here can pass their landed freehold to their children. HDB dwellers, you have no legacy to pass after 99 years.

If we don't have some of this, I fear we might have a situation like Thailand where the monarchy/army is so powerful they can simply arrest everyone into obedience.

The truth is, the system will always fail. There's no perfect police, legal system, govt, etc. People should be allowed to criticise authority and raise their voices against wrongdoers (of course, don't resort to violence, just online vigilante verbally). Only then can society improve.

> SINGAPORE: As the sun sets and the office crowd files out, Orchard Towers sheds its skin and transforms into a different place.

> 

> Neon signs come alive, scantily dressed women front the myriad bars and pubs, and a different kind of crowd populates the building.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Most of the floors in the 18-storey landmark are taken up by office space, but the first five floors are commercial, dominated by bars and pubs that have given the once family-oriented shopping centre a seedy reputation.

> 

> The mall was the scene of a fight in the early hours of Tuesday (Jul 2), which resulted in the death of a 31-year-old man. On Thursday, seven people aged between 22 and 27 were charged with common intention to murder Mr Satheesh Noel Gobidass.

> This followed another fatal incident at the same location in 2016 when a Frenchman died after he was assaulted by two men, who were subsequently convicted and jailed.

> And last year, five men were arrested for rioting at the taxi stand outside Orchard Towers.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Yet, while still reeling from the incident on their doorstep, the mall remains safe, according to tenants CNA spoke to on Friday.

> In fact, they added that Orchard Towers was no different from any other place that had nightclubs, pubs, karaoke bars and late-night drinking.

> 

> FIGHTING HAPPENS ""EVERYWHERE"" WITH DRINKS

> ‚ÄúFighting is common here, but anywhere where you have heavy drinking, there‚Äôs a potential for something to happen,‚Äù said a conference organiser who wanted only to be known as Mr Lee.

> 

> When his clients from overseas are in town, he takes them to dinner - ""very good Thai food"" - and then to a bar in the mall, he said.

> The food and drinks are cheap, and his clients leave very happy, he said. He too, he added, nurses a beer or two from time to time on his own there.

> 

> ‚ÄúMany things can happen, but if you don‚Äôt participate, you are safe,‚Äù he said.

> 

> Rental for his 80 sq m office is also half that of other locations in the area, Mr Lee said; something that has kept him there all these years. This despite his daughter‚Äôs hope that he would one day move out of the building.

> 

> File photo of Orchard Towers. (Photo: Jalelah Abu Baker)

> Mr Mohd Faruk, who works at a tailor shop on the ground floor, compared the place to other districts overseas that have call girls and late-night drinking.

> 

> ‚ÄúSuch places exist all around the world. It's no different here; it‚Äôs not a big deal,‚Äù he said.

> 

> Ms Yao, who owns a shop that sells clothes for clubbing and high-heeled shoes, has no concerns about safety in the mall, so much so that she mans her shop on her own until 6am.

> 

> ‚ÄúThere is so much security here. There are security guards and everyone here is my friends, so if I need help, I can ask them,‚Äù she said.

> 

> There have been occasions when she has had to ask for help, when men enter her shop drunk. But she said, she has never had any bad experiences.

> 

> ‚ÄúAs long as there are clubs and drinking, there will be fights,‚Äù she said.

> 

> One convenience store owner whose shop is near the back entrance of the mall, said that while he hears of, or hears, the fights, he very rarely sees them because they happen outside or on the upper floors.

> 

> He did not want to be named, but he said that in the five years he has been working there, he has not had trouble at his shop, despite staying open all night and closing at 6am.

> 

> Other convenience stores had similar stories.

> Another owner, who also did not want to be named, said that the worst he has encountered were drunk customers getting angry when told of the price of items.

> 

> By day, the tenants said, the mall is like any other mixed-use space that has offices, as the lunchtime crowds throng the many food outlets in and around the vicinity.

> 

> A file photo of Orchard Towers. (Photo: Darius Boey)

> BUSINESSES HAVE TAKEN A HIT

> But the tenants acknowledged that the reputation of the place being a drinking hole has made walk-in customers all but disappear.

> 

> Mr Faruk used to own a tailoring business of his own, but shut down after 15 years.

> 

> As the pubs and bars sprouted, the mall gained its reputation as an entertainment spot, and the number of walk-in customers dwindled. His business took a 75 per cent hit, he said.

> 

> ‚ÄúNo one comes here for shopping,‚Äù Mr Faruk said, although he said the general economic slowdown was partly to blame.

> 

> Another employee from a jewellery store said that on Fridays and Saturdays, it is not uncommon to see people sitting on the steps outside into the wee hours, and to see vomit on the ground.

> 

> Money changer Zahir Hussain, whose family has owned the shop he works in for 40 years, said that he survives on the business of regulars. More business from walk-in customers would not hurt, he said.

> 

> But he may have a problem. At 6.45pm on Friday, 15 minutes before he was going to close, a customer entered his shop.

> 

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so early, how come the music is already so loud?‚Äù he asked, referring to the din from a nearby club.

> 

> Mr Hussain lamented the reputation of the mall, and said it was not always like this.

> Even as the bars and the clubs started popping up, they would close at 12am. The entertainment spots were also high-class and attracted a different type of crowd, he said.

> 

> He was especially upset with shops he said were masquerading as hair or beauty salons, but were in fact sleazy joints. A walk along the upper floors reveals these shops fronted by women in skimpy outfits, very unlike beauty outlets elsewhere in the country.

> 

> Along with other businesses, he has tried to appeal to the management to weed out such shops, he said.

> But Mr Hussain seemed to take the rough with the smooth.

> 

> ‚ÄúWe are used to it. And my shop is outside the ERP zone; so at least that‚Äôs good,‚Äù he said.

2324,9,fuz3g4d,t3_h9srsi,"How poorly written is this article? Nowhere does it address the real issues that Orchard Road is facing?

From my pov these are some quick and easy fixes that need to be done.

1. Monthly car free weekends from ION/Tang's to Somerset
2. Cycle paths, remove all cyclists from the pavements and give them their own space on the road (most of SG could actually do with this).
3. Less stores but larger and better, retailers are screaming for this. Singapore has the space but mall operators prefer to have smaller stores as recently that has meant higher yields. This results in the repetition of stores. There literally are no flagship stores in SG despite the fact that there is appetite from the retailers. More Apple type stores that pull in shoppers on street level. Sometimes less is more.
4. Activate the street level, it's not too hot to walk, there's plenty of shade and start offering young entrepreneurs the chance to operate kiosks or stalls at  subsidized fees.
5. Pedestrian Scrambles, all crossings should allow for diagonal crossings to make it easier, for a car hating place like SG they make certain areas next to impossible to navigate on foot, traffic lights simply take too long and are programmed for the car convenience and not for pedestrians.
6. Fix the Scott's Road crossing and get a pedestrian crossing there. For tourists and some locals it's next to impossible to find your way from Tang's/ION to Wheelock or Shaw Centre.

The days that SG was #1 in SEA for shopping are long gone. These days I'd hazard to say that it might even be behind places like Bangkok, KL and quite possibly Jakarta. Shopping here is dull, partially that's down to the retailers but it's also down to the real estate owners that don't allow for great concept stores to be developed without the HUGE financial outlay. The tide is going to turn pretty soon, have a vacant asset or have one that's full but make slightly less money than you normally would. Ultimately if an area has great footfall and is attracting lots of people the rents/commissions can go up.

Jewel is a joke for retail with only  a handful of stores worth visiting, the rest is chain restaurants that are overpriced and under deliver. MBS is a great space but it's aimed at the luxury consumer mainly and very little footfall in general.

I also think that the URA plans have missed the real issues here.

> As the coronavirus pandemic accelerates the transition to e-commerce, the grand dame of shopping in Singapore must pull itself together to regain its status as the little red dot‚Äôs most popular street, says Karen Tee.

> SINGAPORE: Last week, I finally set foot in Orchard Road for the first time since Singapore‚Äôs circuit breaker started in April to get a much-needed haircut.

> It felt good to return to my old stomping ground but it was also disconcerting to walk through the empty shopping district.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Many boutiques had cleared out their window displays and packed away stock. The corridors of Mandarin Gallery were empty, save for the occasional delivery person hustling to pick up food from an F&B outlet that had kept its kitchen open.

> At Takashimaya basement, where I had dropped by for a brief supermarket sweep at Cold Storage, I paused to gape at the bizarre sight of the mall‚Äôs vacant bazaar atrium which in normal times is usually thrumming with bargain hunters.

> I was saddened to witness this once vibrant, bustling shopping district now devoid of activity.

> Yet in a way, this ghost town scene also offers a dystopian peek into what might lay ahead for this shopping street years in the future, if it continues on this gradual path of decline.

> Advertisement

> HOW NOW ORCHARD ROAD?

> Orchard Road‚Äôs troubles started long before the coronavirus‚Äô advent. In recent years, there has been much talk about how it has been slowly losing its appeal, especially in comparison to newer and more architecturally impressive destinations like Marina Bay Sands and Jewel Changi Airport.

> 

> Last year‚Äôs sordid Orchard Towers murder case, which led to a renewed scrutiny of this sleazy, vice-filled corner of this supposedly glitzy district, did not help either.

> Increasing vacancy rates, high rents and decreasing footfall have tarnished Orchard‚Äôs shine.

> Mall landlords too have a role to play in this sad state of affairs, in choosing to sign on cookie-cutter tenants, leading to an uncanny sameness among multiple buildings along the shopping strip, which hardly encourages leisurely mall-hopping.

> Now, with non-essential retail stores shuttered during the circuit breaker and food establishments allowed only to operate delivery and take-out services, like most other malls around Singapore and the world, the district has become tragically irrelevant.

> Even Mandarin Gallery was empty, save for a few food deliverers. (Photo: Karen Tee)

> COVID-19 MADE THINGS WORSE

> Retail‚Äôs reliance on human traffic and physical interaction has been its Achilles‚Äô heel.

> The collapse was swift. According to the latest data released by the Department of Statistics, retail sales in Singapore plunged by 40 per cent year-on-year in April. Even more heart-stopping is the freefall drop in sales for Orchard Road-centric categories such as department stores (-75 per cent), apparel and footwear (-74.8 per cent) as well as watches and jewellery (-81.3 per cent).

> Marquee events have been cancelled. While Orchard Road‚Äôs signature event, the Great Singapore Sale, was finally regaining some steam last year, there will be no GSS this year because of COVID-19.

> These may be the first signs of an impending coronavirus-triggered global retail apocalypse. While there have been some initial reports of post-lockdown ‚Äúrevenge spending‚Äù in South Korea and China, experts agree shoppers will not likely return in hordes, especially with concerns about safe distancing, not to mention an impending recession.

> In the United States, the looting and destruction of many shopping districts during the Black Lives Matters riots have added a security dimension to the challenge that will likely delay the reopening of these destinations even as COVID-19 restrictions are eased.

> And in Europe, there is currently little news about shopping surges even though some countries have been gradually reopening.

> This crisis has even gripped longstanding retail titans. Inditex, the company which owns fast fashion brand Zara, announced this week it would be shuttering up to 1,200 stores worldwide. Other clothing giants such as H&M and Gap have also reported sharp declines in sales.

> In Singapore, household names like apparel brand Esprit is closing all 11 stores here, Robinsons is winding up its Jem department store by August and many local retailers are unsure how long they can continue staying in business in this gloomy climate.

> E-COMMERCE OUR NEW NORMAL

> In this harsh new reality, many brands and retailers have been scrambling to make an almost panicked pivot to digital shopping. The transformation has been messy but worth applauding when more are recognising the permanence of this sea change.

> A shopper is seen along Orchard Road, Apr 4, 2020. (Photo: Jeremy Long)

> This makes sensible strategy whether you‚Äôre a chain or a single shop. Even luxury brands, a category traditionally been slow to make the e-commerce leap and preferring to provide clients with a full, sensorial in-store experience, are now aggressively touting their online shopping and delivery services.

> Though I have always preferred to browse in a physical store, I too have been unable to resist buying things online just for the temporary thrill of retail therapy while confined at home. (I am now the sheepish owner of too much exercise equipment, a dozen identical crew-neck t-shirts in different colours and a few sets of pink fairy lights.)

> Many people have moved from hesitantly trying out online shopping for essentials like groceries or toilet paper to buying so much more - and they will likely never look back.

> When the economy reopens, people might do some shopping on their weekly supermarket runs, so shops in heartland malls may experience some lift from pent up demand.

> Yet where does that leave Orchard Road if heading to the main shopping district is no longer a weekend routine to pass time? Will the coronavirus usher in an ice age for retail promenades?

> A GLIMMER OF HOPE

> There is a chance this pandemic might induce a much more compelling Orchard Road to emerge from the ashes. We know that plans are already ongoing to transform the shopping belt, unveiled last year by Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing.

> However, many of its initial proposals, including pedestrianising sections of the road and holding more street activities seem counter to the need for social distancing for the foreseeable future.

> The committee may need to modify these plans to address this reality. Hopefully they will also consider this key question - how can Orchard Road continue attracting serious big spenders?

> As it is, the root of the issue - that the repetitiveness of the shops are just kind of uninspiring - is something that only landlords can figure out.

> Even international luxury brands can afford to differentiate their local boutiques a little better. For instance, is there even a difference between the Louis Vuitton boutiques at Ion Orchard and Takashimaya?

> Maybe it is not such a bad thing that Zara, Esprit and possibly other fast fashion brands might be closing at least some of their multiple cloned Orchard Road stores. This would then create the opportunity for more creative and varied uses of the vacated space.

> A woman passes closed shops in a section of a mall in Singapore. (File photo: Reuters/Edgar Su)

> As someone who has fond memories of trawling the tiny indie boutiques at youth hangouts like Far East Plaza and The Heeren and spending hours in Tower Records, I truly miss the quirky and unique spirit of this bygone era.

> Other once popular Singapore brands, like Song+Kelly, Alldressedup and Mphosis have sadly folded, at least in part due to the proliferation of fast fashion. These were the shopping destinations that gave consumers a sense of Singapore at its most inspiring, a factor that is key in getting people to hand over their credit cards.

> Think of the spaceship-like Comme des Garcons flagship in Omotesando, Tokyo; the riotously exuberant Style Nanda boutique in Seoul, South Korea; or the ornate Galeries Lafayette in Paris. When you visit those boutiques, chances are, you would probably buy at least a small item as a memento to remind you of the experience.

> More than ever, we need standout, one-of-a-kind and ideally homegrown retail concepts in Singapore that cannot be found elsewhere to anchor our flagship shopping district.

> We already know people will still spend money.

> 

> With retail shops opening this Friday (Jun 19) as we enter phase 2, perhaps there will be a boost in sales figures with the population in a celebratory mood.

> But in the longer run in phase 3 and beyond, as people become accustomed to living with social distancing as the default, they will need a compelling reason to strap on a mask, step out of their homes and continue making their way into a brick-and-mortar shop.

Malls are everywhere but only one street in Singapore is a big boulevard with wide, leafy sidewalks crowded with people 7 days a week. If the malls on Orchard want people back then make Orchard nicer for pedestrians. #1 and 4-6 on this list are musts.

Pedestrians also dislike sameness. There needs to be more variation than mall, mall, mall. Though rethinking the shopping in the malls is key, such as flagship/iconic stores, I think the area in general gets more business if you mix up the retail and include more F&B at street level. It's inconvenient to go into basements. And who goes to Orchard for basements? Ok -- a lot of people. I get that aircon is a must for a significant percentage of S'poreans. But the rest of us go for the road! Make the road fun. More food, more drink. A hawker center perhaps?

On #6, Scotts Road intersection is tricky. It is labyrinthine underground and totally unfriendly to the newcomer. But the intersection itself is massive, all asphalt and no shade.

IMO, the main blindside is that they‚Äôve made Orchard road into ‚Äújust a bunch of Malls‚Äù ... there‚Äôs very little ‚Äústreet level‚Äù stuff around, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúcool factor‚Äù or ‚Äúvibrancy‚Äù (like Harajuku), there‚Äôs not much spaces for young people to hang out (unlike say, the late 90‚Äôs / early 2000‚Äôs, when I was growing up), nothing interesting to see apart from luxury boutiques and large chains you can find in the heartland Malls (and that‚Äôs because of rent prices) - hence a lot less footfall than in previous years.

Think this is a great point, in general there is no atmosphere on Orchard. There's this massive underused square in front of Ngee Ann City which could be filled with hawkers everyday at 5PM or something, or at least one weekend a month...

The only two spots worth considering at the moment are Crossroads cafe at Tang's and Prive across the road at Wheelock. Both places are  always busy (IMO). The roof at Design Orchard would also have been perfect for a local coffee/kopi company or even a bar of some sort, it's another lovely spot but completely underused.",t3_h9srsi,16-06-2020

But yeah that place does have potential and I think it still sees a decent crowd (got that famous bubble tea store and some other eateries I think)

If you‚Äôre referring to The Cathay at Dhoby Ghaut, then that place really feels like it‚Äôs a few months away from being abandoned. It has a ghost town sort of vibe. (only good things in that mall for me are the art store in the basement, Matchaya, and the cinema)",t3_h9srsi,17-06-2020

Just like department stores, supermarkets etc. The operator wants you to navigate the entire building to get maximum spend. It's easy enough fixed if they decide to drop the retail space by that amazing window and let you go from one escalator to the next. It's also one of few malls with some decent daylight (another plus if you ask me).

I kinda like Funan. Decent F&B operators, some different retailers that are not all over the island and different location.

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî A woman who was waiting impatiently to top-up her EZ-Link card at the passenger service centre at Orchard MRT station last year hurled vulgarities at a staff member and assaulted him, a court heard.

> Nur Ellyna Abdul Karim, 27, hit the 59-year-old victim twice on the cheek.

> When the victim tried to stop Nur Ellyna from leaving, the woman assaulted him further, hitting his forehead and the back of his head. She also attacked two other public transport workers.

> At the State Courts last Thursday (21 June), Nur Ellyna was sentenced to five weeks‚Äô jail along with a $3,000 fine. She pleaded guilty to causing hurt, using insulting words and a separate charge of disorderly behaviour.

> The assault on the other two staff were considered in sentencing.

> She is out on bail pending an appeal against her sentence.

> At about 6pm on 16 January last year, SMRT service ambassador Sapiie Katib and an assistant station manager were attending to a passenger to process her train ticket refund at the passenger service centre.

> Next in line was Nur Ellyna, who was waiting to top up her EZ-Link card. She grew impatient and started shouting ‚Äúfaster faster‚Äù at the SMRT staff to hurry up.

> Sapiie told her to wait as the passenger ahead of her was still being served.

> But Nur Ellyna replied, ‚ÄúYah, I cannot wait, you got a problem is it?‚Äù She also used vulgarities in Malay, saying ‚Äúsial‚Äù and ‚Äúkonek‚Äù, which means ‚Äújinx‚Äù and ‚Äúpenis‚Äù.

> She then used her left hand and hit Sapiie‚Äôs right cheek twice before trying to leave.

> When Sapiie tried to stop her from leaving, she hit him thrice on the forehead and on the back of his head. Nur Ellyna was subsequently detained by passers-by.

> Separately, on 9 December last year, policemen arrested Nur Ellyna at about 4am at the void deck of an HDB block in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 for disorderly behaviour. She was shouting at the top of her voice after a dispute with her then boyfriend and did not calm down despite several warnings. She also put up a violent struggle during arrest.

> In written grounds released on Thursday (27 June), District Judge Tan Jen Tse said Nur Ellyna‚Äôs attack on a public transport worker warranted a deterrent sentence and a minimum sentence of four weeks‚Äô jail.

> Her assault was also aggravated as Sapiie, who was fairly elderly, was repeatedly attacked and Nur Ellyna tried to flee the scene. The offence was also committed during the evening rush hour and would have caused a public disturbance, the judge noted.

> In sentencing, the judge took into account that Nur Ellyna has a history of major depression and was in a state of remission at the time of the offence. He also noted that she is six months‚Äô pregnant.

> For causing hurt, Nur Ellyna could have been jailed for up to two years and fined $5,000.

> She could have been fined up to $5,000 and also jailed for a year for using insulting words on a public service worker.

> The maximum punishment for disorderly behaviour is a fine of up to $2,000 along with a jail term of up to six months for a first conviction.

> On April 1, the Singapore government decided to implement a no-smoking zone around the main shopping belt in the city-state located at Orchard Road.

> Since then, smokers both in and visiting the country heaved a collective groan as they now have to run to smoking zones located at random corners and alleys behind major buildings to light up.

> But nothing is sadder than watching a bunch of people squeeze into a tiny smoking zone so that they don‚Äôt get fined by authorities if they step out of the smoking zone.

> This tragic sight of humanity being reduced to mere digits on a new law was captured by Facebook user Adam Atelophobia, who uploaded this photo on Friday evening on his Facebook page:

> In the photo, a bunch of smokers are seen squeezing into a smoking box located in between the Tangs and Lucky Plaza malls along Orchard Road ‚Äî a sight that would make any claustrophobic person get major anxiety attacks.

> Adam captioned the photo as ‚ÄúSmoke also need to queue‚Äù but it seems to appear ‚Äî at least to us ‚Äî that it only looks like a queue, with most of the smokers fitting in nicely into the box and standing in a queue-like formation.

> The comments on this post are equally hilarious, with Facebook user Wong Hong Cheng Wong typing a really hearty ‚ÄúHAHJAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA EPIC LMAO‚Äù (sic) and user Ng Kang Wei typing out a very simple reaction: ‚ÄúPathetic‚Äù.

> We think part of why Singaporeans are becoming very paranoid about making sure they stay in the smoking box ‚Äî true to our nature of always following the rules ‚Äî might be due to a recent incident where a man was apparently fined S$200 (US$146) for having one foot outside of the smoking box.

> Well, apparently not everyone is pissed about these smoking boxes; some tourists seem to be lapping up the fresh air along the main Orchard Road belt now that the smokers are gone, as seen by this photo:

The priority goes something like this:

1) Common nouns: For places not named after a person, but a feature (e.g. Marina Bay, Bayfront), the meaning of the word will be translated

2) Proper Nouns (names, etc.): Historic precedence. If the place is named after a person, that person's name in that language (if available) will be used. If the name appeared in the history books previously, it will be named accordingly. (e.g. Temple Street is translated phonetically because locals used that pronunciation in dialect back in the early 1900s, therefore setting precedence)

3) Phonetic equivalence: For Chinese words, the pronunciation of the opening phoneme takes priority over the tone of the word. Translators usually have a shortlist of words for each syllable to propose.

4) Meaning: non-offensive words. You won't see words that may have potential for entendres or words that could offend anyone. Preferably something 'prosperous' if it's in Chinese.

From the shortlist of words filtered from the process, the committee will then discuss and select the most suitable name.

Interesting anecdote: Bras Basah Complex's Chinese name used to be ‰π¶Âüé (literally 'Book City'), on account of the bookstores there.

Bukit panjang, lmao, ""long hill"". I mean ye cos the hill ridges stretches all the way from bukit timah all the way west to bt panjang so it's a long hill for sure.

> However, the Facebook post has sparked much public outrage, garnering over 1,200 shares so far.

> The post said that enforcement officers wearing plain clothes have issued a few motorcyclists riding or parking on pedestrian pavements along Orchard Road.

> Here's the post:

> It also reiterated the penalties against offenders include up to S$2,000 fine and three months jail.

> Public outrage, fines not tackling root of problem

> While the enforcement action is important to ensure the pedestrians can use the pavement safely and in an unobstructed manner, many comments also urged LTA to show some empathy and leniency towards food delivery riders.

> A few comments highlighted that issuing fines to delivery riders who parked illegally on pedestrian pavements is the result of a lack of designated parking facilities at Orchard Road.

> Speaking to Mothership, a food delivery rider going by the Facebook handle Joey Fred Collins, said that even a grace period of 10 minutes can be insufficient given the time spent waiting for the food.

> ""... Most car parks are like this, excluding wait time for food, we wait for [the] lift and all, not enough time really. [...] One delivery is maybe S$5 to S$7, there's no way we can spend S$1 or more, HDB parking sometimes we spend 10 cents, 20 cents etc no choice, but mall parking isn't the same. On top of that mall's parking, to enter, sometimes will have traffic jam.""

> Here are some comments made in response to the post:

> Calls for better facilities for delivery riders

> A Workers' Party member, Azhar Abdul Latip, who previously contested in East Coast GRC, also spoke out in response to this particular LTA post.

> He mentioned VivoCity as an example of a mall that has already created designated lots for delivery persons to park temporarily.

> ""And if VivoCity is able to come up with such an arrangement, I am sure it can be done at other places as well. What needs to be done is a working together between the food delivery companies and the building management to designate a suitable place to allow for short term bike parking without posing any dangers to pedestrians. If building management can increase their bike lots capacity in their existing parking areas, all the better.""

> Here's his post:

> Previously, Member of Parliament Hany Soh also called for a 15-minute grace period and designated pick-up points for delivery riders.

Cost.

MapleTree probably thought it would be financially beneficial to create special parking zones for delivery personnel, but other developers may not come to the same conclusion. I'm sure there's also an element of apprehension because what if this entire food delivery gig economy goes away in the next 2 years? How do I justify the sunk cost? Repurpose the area?

It's really how they want to weigh the cost, benefit and risk.

2512,9,g84oi4v,t1_g84oaex,"If you take public land for free private parking, you are either subsidising the food delivery services, the mall owners, or both.

2513,9,g84p6v5,t1_g84oi4v,"But it is not public land, it‚Äôs under the mall jurisdiction.  It is land already owned by the malls.  Have you seen where the motorcycles park?",t3_j67cks,08-10-2020
2514,9,g84pg6i,t1_g84p6v5,"Why would a landlord do this if not forced to do it?  That‚Äôs the entire point of my comment.  The tenants are happy, the food companies are happy, the only ones not happy are the people outside the mall.

2515,9,g84ptr8,t1_g84pg6i,"There is already no objection from the Malls to do so.  Usually it‚Äôs only LTA or Cisco that catches these offences.  Also,  if you have a demarcated space for short term parking (e.g. 5mins) then it tends to obstruct less pathway because you set the demarcations.  I‚Äôve worked in food delivery pre-Uni so I know.

And as I‚Äôve said, it‚Äôs been done before at Square2.

As for why it hasent been done yet? I really don‚Äôt know but the best Guess is that some shops at the front may complain.  But again this can be solved if done properly.",t3_j67cks,08-10-2020

So, how would you make a mall owner do it? Ask them nicely?",t3_j67cks,08-10-2020
2517,9,g84z8m6,t1_g84qapv,"Hmm does the walking place outside lucky plaza belong to lucky plaza? Does the wide space outside Orchard central, for instance belong to the mall?  I honestly think so.

LTA will also fine riders who simply park on the private pavements as well, because they assume it to be non-parking spaces. So what the Square2 did was explicitly demarcate a certain space.  And before that, you could be fined at the exact same space before the ‚Äòparking area for food delivery‚Äô sign was up.",t3_j67cks,08-10-2020

Square2 might have ‚Äúdone the right thing‚Äù, but the issue then is why any other mall would care.  How do you propose to make mall owners do this?  Passing a law might indeed be simpler in Singapore than elsewhere but since the problem is caused by food delivery companies, it seems the target should be food delivery companies and not mall owners.",t3_j67cks,09-10-2020

2527,9,f4a64tl,t3_dk3cwa,"> # Orchard Towers brawl: Tears as woman gets murder charge reduced

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî More than three months after she was charged with murder in relation to the high-profile Orchard Towers brawl in July, Natalie Siow Yu Zhen found out on Friday (Oct 18) that she will no longer face the death penalty.

> The 23-year-old ‚Äî the only woman among seven who¬†on July 4¬†were charged with the murder of 31-year-old Satheesh Noel Gobidass ‚Äî had her charge reduced to one of voluntarily causing hurt.

> If convicted, Siow faces a maximum sentence of two years in jail and a S$5,000 fine.

> It was an unexpected turn of events for Siow, who did not know why she was called back to court on Friday. She burst into tears upon finding out that she no longer faces the gallows shortly before the court session began at 2.30pm.

> ‚ÄúBefore the judge came out, she was wondering what she was doing in court. She had no idea what was going on,‚Äù her lawyer, Mr Amarick Gill of Amarick Gill LLC, told TODAY.

> Mr Gill said that it had been two months since he told her that she should more appropriately be charged with voluntarily causing hurt and that he and his assistant, Ms Cheryl Ng of Intelleigen Legal, would make representations for that. They were back in court on Friday as the prosecution acceded to the request, he said.

> Her amended charge now states that she had kicked and punched the victim together with Tan Sen Yang, 28, Joel Tan Yun Sheng, 26, and Ang Da Yuan, 26 ‚Äî the trio still face the murder charge.

> Siow was offered bail of S$15,000.

> She walked out of the State Court at about 6pm with her father and a family friend.

> Her case will be mentioned again on Oct 25.

> THE INCIDENT

> The Orchard Towers incident that shook the nation unfolded in the early hours of July 2, when a man was found lying motionless in a pool of blood at the entrance of Orchard Towers.

> A video footage of the incident later went viral on social media, showing a man collapsing near an escalator in the building after a brawl, prompting onlookers to rush forward to check on him. The victim died in Tan Tock Seng Hospital about an hour later.

> The police established the identities of eight suspects ‚Äî two among them are women ‚Äî and arrested them within 12 hours.

> Of the eight, seven were charged on July 4. Apart from Siow, Tan Sen Yang, Joel Tan Yun Sheng and Ang, the others charged were Tan Hong Sheng, 22; Loo Boon Chong, 25; and Chan Jia Xing, 26.

> On July 11, Tan Hong Sheng, Loo and Chan had their murder charges reduced to that of consorting with Tan Sen Yang who is said to have had a foldable ‚ÄúKerambit‚Äù knife at about 5.45am on July 2 at Naughty Girl Club in Orchard Towers. The knife was allegedly used in the attack.

> Loo and Chan are currently out on bail, while Tan Hong Sheng, who was originally on bail, has been in custody since Sept 27 after jumping bail on Aug 29 when he failed to attend his hearing in a district court.

> Tan Hong Sheng‚Äôs mother reported the matter to the police and a warrant of arrest was issued against him. He was arrested, then handed another charge ‚Äî this time for rioting outside Club Secret at Central Mall in Clarke Quay at about 3.30am on Aug 9.

> Video footage of the incident posted online shows a group of at least 20 youths fighting in a car park.

The prosecution just decided to charge the accused with VCH instead of murder. As to why - no one except the AGC will know.

> SINGAPORE - Hokkaido's Bake Cheese Tart will close its final outlet and exit the Singapore market by the end of October.

> The brand told The Straits Times the move will not affect its other overseas branches, such as those in Bangkok and Seoul.

> Bake previously had outlets at Westgate and Nex malls, and its sole remaining outlet at Ion Orchard will be taken over by Croquant Chou Chou Zakuzaku in end November. Bake's sister brand will offer the famous Croquant Chou - a stick version of a cream puff filled with fresh cream.

> When Bake first opened here in Ion Orchard in 2016, fans queued for up to two hours to get their hands on the tarts, which have a mousse-like cream cheese filling and crisp pastry. Many bakeries here, including Paris Baguette, BreadTalk, and Prima Deli, also launched their own versions of the snack.

> In an interview with ST in 2016, Bake's president and chief executive Shintaro Naganuma had already expressed his intention to bring Croquant Chou Chou Zakuzaku to Singapore.

> Besides cream puffs, the brand also offers soft serve ice cream made with Hokkaido milk and coated with croquant chunks as well as crispy puffs filled with ice cream.

> Prior to Croquant Chou Chou Zakuzaku's debut here, one can get a taste of its snacks at Takashimaya Square's Japan Food Matsuri, which runs from Thursday (Oct 3) to Oct 20.

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî After jumping bail a month ago, one of the seven suspects involved in the alleged murder at Orchard Towers has been nabbed and hauled back to court on Friday (Sept 27).

> Tan Hong Sheng, 22, was among three of the accused who had their murder charges reduced to consorting with a person carrying an offensive weapon in a public place.

> The three men were released on bail of S$15,000, but on Aug 29, Tan failed to attend his hearing in a district court and remained uncontactable. His mother reported the matter to the police and a warrant of arrest was issued against him.¬†

> Tan was arrested on Thursday.

> They are accused of consorting with Tan Sen Yang, 28, who is said to have had a foldable Kerambit knife at about 5.45am that morning at Naughty Girl Club in Orchard Towers.

> On Friday, Tan was handed another charge ‚Äî this time for rioting, which carries a maximum punishment of seven years‚Äô jail and caning.

> Court documents showed that along with four others, he allegedly punched and kicked 30-year-old Neo Zhao Fu outside Club Secret, along Magazine Road in Clarke Quay, on Aug 9 at about 3.30am.

> District Judge Terence Tay ordered him to be remanded in Central Police Division for one week, and he can be taken out for scene visits. He will return to court on Oct 4.

> He is still represented by lawyers Josephus Tan and Cory Wong from Invictus Law Corporation.

> Video footage of the incident was posted online, showing a large group of at least 20 youths punching and fighting with each other in a car park.

> The other two men whose charges were reduced are Loo Boon Chong, 25, and Chan Jia Xing, 26. They remain out on bail and will return to court on Oct 10.

> Tan‚Äôs, Loo‚Äôs and Chan‚Äôs charge under the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act carries a maximum jail term of three years, and at least six strokes of the cane.

> The other four accused persons still face a charge that carries the death penalty ‚Äî committing murder with common intention.

> They are Natalie Siow Yu Zhen, 22, Joel Tan Yun Sheng, 26, Ang Da Yuan, 26, and Tan Sen Yang. They could not be offered bail due to the nature of the charge.

> All seven individuals were first charged on July 4 after the victim, 31-year-old Satheesh Noel Gobidass, died in Tan Tock Seng Hospital following a fight in the building.

> Court documents show that the alleged murder happened at about 6.30am on July 2. Satheesh was found lying motionless in a pool of blood at the entrance of Orchard Towers.

1) **Lower the rent**, so that specialty shops can be more viable and improve the diversity of shops around the area. Been ages since i went to orchard road and there is no need for me to when i can just get access to the same shops in heartland malls.

2) Invest resources/relax laws so that creative displays etc can be deployed to make the whole place colorful and attractive. Compared to ximending in taiwan or  the kowloon area of hongkong, our orchard road is really really dull.

Personal opinion, the malls have always parroted ""providing a better shopping experience"". However, simply bringing in more ""high-end"" brands does not equate to a better shopping experience.

This is within the means of the government, without needing the mall owners to agree on anything like lower rent, or having a good mix of tenants.

> SINGAPORE: Crowds were back at Singapore's Orchard Road shopping district on Friday (Jun 19), with many customers eager to make purchases on the first day that retail outlets were allowed to reopen.

> As part of Phase 2 of Singapore's reopening, physical shops were allowed to resume business after being shuttered for more than two months because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

> Long lines were seen at the entrances of malls and some shops when CNA visited Orchard Road on Friday afternoon.

> At ION Orchard, people trying to enter the mall from Orchard MRT station were seen gathering around signs with QR codes to check-in using the national SafeEntry system.

> There were similar scenes at the entrance from the MRT station to Wisma Atria, as well as 313@Somerset.

> Some popular brands, such as Zara at Ngee Ann City, Dior at ION Orchard and Victoria‚Äôs Secret at Mandarin Gallery, also saw long queues outside their stores. This was partly because shops were trying to limit the number of customers inside as part of safe distancing measures.

> At Victoria‚Äôs Secret, a salesperson was seen putting up a sign indicating a 50 per cent sale.

> NICE TO FINALLY BE OUT, SHOPPERS SAY

> Shopper Celine Tan came to Orchard Road at around 11am. She bought a pot from the Takashimaya department store, had lunch and walked through some of the malls after that.

> ‚ÄúIt feels good to be out,‚Äù she said.

> As a housewife, she said she spent most of her time at home during the ‚Äúcircuit breaker‚Äù period and Phase 1 of the reopening to take care of her children, as there were few places she visited apart from the supermarket during the two-and-a-half months.

> Shoppers inside Takashimaya department store at Ngee Ann City. (Photo: Rachel Phua)

> Another visitor at Orchard, Bhavini Gokani, said she has been ‚Äúso busy‚Äù at work with the circuit breaker forcing her to work round the clock that ‚Äúit just feels so good‚Äù to be able to be out, shop, get a hair cut and have brunch.

> ‚ÄúWe used to take these things for granted,‚Äù she told CNA. ‚ÄúI hope we learn to be grateful about doing the small things.‚Äù

> A road crossing along Orchard Road. Many people were spotted along the famous shopping district in the afternoon on Jun 19, 2020. (Photo: Rachel Phua)

> She came out on Friday as she thought most people would be working so the streets would not be that busy.

> University students Tay Zhi Qian and Shernice Lim met at Orchard Road because it was a ‚Äúconvenient location‚Äù. It was the first time the couple have seen each other physically after more than two months.

> ‚ÄúWe cherish the freedom,‚Äù Mr Tay said.

> THE DAY RETAILERS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR

> For Hugo Boss, business has been brisk so far.

> According to managing director of Hugo Boss Southeast Asia Steven Lam, although traffic has fallen, sales on Friday at their Orchard outlets have returned to January levels. About 60 per cent of customers who came into the stores on Friday purchased something.

> ‚ÄúThey come knowing what they want,‚Äù he said, adding that usually, about 80 per cent of those who enter the store leave without buying anything.

> Hugo Boss has three outlets in Orchard Road - at Ngee Ann City, Paragon and ION Orchard.

> Soon after the date of Phase 2 was announced, hair care service provider Papilla Haircare received ""a lot of calls‚Äù for appointments, said its chief executive Elizabeth Leong. She and her business partner Kim Lim also run Illumia Therapeutics at Wheelock Place.

> ‚ÄúToday is a huge relief for all of us,‚Äù she said. Her employees, who rely on commissions on top of their basic salary, are finally able to work again.

> Mr Andrew Tan, managing director of furniture store atomi, said that Friday morning was off to a slow start, but it was expected as Singapore is ‚Äúnot out of the woods‚Äù yet in the fight against COVID-19.

> ‚ÄúWe are just happy we can get things running,‚Äù he said.

> Mr Tan added that selling products online is not enough to sustain the business as it relies on a loyal customer base and people prefer to buy big-ticket items after touching and seeing the product physically.

> All the business owners said that they had been busy the past few days getting their premises clean and ready for the reopening, and putting in place the necessary safe distancing measures.

> Other sales employees CNA spoke to, who did not want to be named as they were not authorised to speak, said that business on Friday was slower than normal. Although there were people constantly walking past their stores, only a handful went in.

> One of the stores at 313@Somerset that remained closed is tea brand T2. (Photo: Rachel Phua)

> Next door to T2, shoes retailer Melissa was also closed on Friday afternoon. (Photo: Rachel Phua)

> Some stores also remained shuttered with no indication on when they will reopen. A notice on tea brand T2‚Äôs shopfront said that it will provide updates via its social media channels and email.

> In the heartlands, shoppers made a cautious return to the stores, with no rush of people or snaking queues.

> There were also fewer people than expected at hawker centres and coffee shops during lunchtime.

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî A woman initially accused of murdering a man after a fight at Orchard Towers but later had her charge reduced to causing hurt returned to the State Courts on Friday (18 October) to receive two additional charges.

> Natalie Siow Yu Zhen, 23, is accused of behaving in a disorderly manner in public, by repeatedly dashing towards a group of patrons who were at the main entrance of the Naughty Girl Club on the second floor of Orchard Towers in a bid to kick and push them between 6.21am and 6.24am on 2 July.

> She is also accused of consorting with Tan Sen Yang, 28, at the nightclub at about 5.45am the same day, knowing that he had in his possession a foldable curved knife.

> District Judge Christopher Goh increased Siow‚Äôs bail amount of $15,000 to $20,000. As part of her bail conditions, she will have to abide by a curfew between 10pm and 7am, be electronically tagged, and cannot contact the co-accused persons in the case.

> Siow‚Äôs case will be mentioned again on 29 November.

> Siow was arrested along with seven men in the aftermath of altercation at Orchard Towers in the early hours of 2 July. Siow and six of the men were later charged with the murder of Satheesh Noel Gobidass, who was 31.

> Subsequently, three of the men had their capital charges replaced with consorting with Tan Sen Yang, knowing that he had in his possession a foldable curved knife.

> Last Friday, Siow had her murder charge reduced to causing hurt. She allegedly punched and kicked Satheesh at the ground floor of Orchard Towers at about 6.25am on 2 July, together with Tan Sen Yang, Joel Tan Yun Sheng, 26, and Ang Da Yuan, 26.

> The punishment for consorting with a person who possesses an offensive weapon is the same as that for the person who carries the weapon: up to three years‚Äô jail with at least six strokes of the cane. Only male offenders below 50 can be caned.

> For causing hurt, the maximum penalty is up to two years‚Äô jail along with a fine of up to $5,000.

> The maximum punishment for behaving in a disorderly manner in public is a fine of up to $2,000 and up to six months‚Äô jail, for a first offence. Repeat offenders face a fine of up to $5,000 and up to one year in jail.

> The altercation was captured by cameras and widely viewed online.

> Video footage showed Satheesh fighting with some individuals before stumbling to the building's entrance and collapsing there. He was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital but died at about 7.25am.

> The trio facing the consorting charges are Tan Hong Sheng, 22, Chan Jia Xing, 26, and Loo Boon Chong, 25.

> The remaining three men who still face murder charges are Tan Sen Yang, Joel Tan Yun Sheng and Ang Da Yuan. They face the death penalty, if convicted.

> SINGAPORE - The sensitive restoration of a century-old shophouse, near MacDonald House in Orchard Road, picked up one of the island's most prestigious conservation awards at the annual Architectural Heritage Awards on Monday (Oct 21).

> Called Temasek Shophouse, the building which used to be a townhouse with apartments and shops, was the sole winner of the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) award for restoration.

> The URA, which has been administering the award since 1995, said the building's original ornamentation and missing features were carefully restored, returning it as close to its original form as possible.

> For instance, false ceilings at its five-footway were removed, drawing attention to its original double height columns.

> Inside, a two-storey atrium now stands in the place of bulky escalators from the 1980s, introducing a new sense of spaciousness to the building, it said.

> The 18-month restoration of the state property had been undertaken by lessee Temasek Trustees and architect Surbana Jurong Consultants.

> The site is home to Temasek‚Äôs philanthropy arm and has space for its co-working partners, as well as a public arena on the ground level.

> The award was announced by Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for National Development, at an event which also marked the URA's 30-year conservation journey.

> He spent much of his speech emphasising the importance of community partnerships and support in making the cityscape more diverse.

> Related Story URA to conserve former Singapore Chinese Girls' School buildings in Emerald Hill

> Related Story Public encouraged to inject new ideas into old buildings under URA, SLA reinvention scheme

> On the award, Ms Yvonne Tay, director of Temasek Shophouse, said: ""To take over an old conserved building and re-imagine it as something that can make an impact on Singapore's future, is something we are happy to be doing.""

> In his speech, Mr Lee noted that the authorities have taken a more inclusive and consultative approach to co-create and sustain Singapore's built heritage landscape.

> For example, he highlighted the efforts of a group of Singapore Chinese Girls' School alumnae who conducted community workshops to put together a proposal to conserve their former campus at 37 Emerald Hill Road.

> URA, which had already been studying the overall plans for the Orchard Road area, carefully considered the group's proposal as part of its review, he said.

> The site's three oldest buildings are now conserved.

> Mr Lee said Singapore's conservation journey can be traced back to as early as the 1960s when pioneer planners saw the importance of selectively and pragmatically protecting the island's built heritage.

> He paid tribute to individuals such as Mr Alan Choe, the first general manager of the Urban Renewal Unit in the 1960s; Mrs Koh-Lim Wen Gin, who as a young architect led an urban design team in the 1970s to conserve low-rise historic districts in the city centre and made conservation a priority; and Mr Khoo Teng Chye, who later took up the role of chief executive and chief planner of URA.

> Mr Lee added that then-Minister for National Development, Mr S. Dhanabalan, who was present at the event, had provided critical political support to make urban conservation a reality in 1989 when URA formalised its conservation programme and conserved more than 3,200 buildings in the districts of Chinatown, Little India, Kampong Glam, Boat Quay, Clarke Quay, Cairnhill and Emerald Hill.

> Mrs Koh-Lim, who also addressed event attendees at the URA's building in Maxwell Road, noted the challenges ahead of Singapore's conservation journey, such as the question of the future of Singapore's now rundown post-independent, modern architectural landmarks.

> She urged for their retention and for them to be ""reused and recycled"" in the name of sustainability as they serve as markers of Singapore's progress. This was met with applause.

> These buildings include Golden Mile Complex and People's Park Complex.

> Mr Lee also recognised the efforts of URA's conservation partners such as public agency, the Singapore Tourism Board, and organisations such as the Singapore Heritage Society.

> He said: ""We have taken a more inclusive and consultative approach to co-create and sustain our built heritage landscape.

> ""We will continue to engage and collaborate deeply with the industry, community, and all Singaporeans to protect, sustain and enliven our built heritage for the next 30 years, and many more generations to come.""

> SINGAPORE - Two MRT lines were hit by power faults on Sunday morning (May 26).

> According to Twitter alerts from operator SMRT, a fault hit the North-South Line around 6.30am, slowing service between Newton and Marina South Pier to a crawl.

> SMRT said travel time would be lengthened by 30 minutes.

> It activated free bus services, which continued after it managed to rectify the fault about an hour and a half later.

> But just as soon as it happened, the Circle Line was hit by a power fault.

> Because of that, SMRT said there would be no service between Marina Bay and Bayfront. Again, it activated buses.

> The fault on this stretch was resolved just past 8am.

> Later at 8.26am, SMRT tweeted again that there was another power fault on the North-South Line, halting service between Marina South Pier and Orchard.

> SMRT said that there would be free regular bus as well as free bridging bus services between Marina South Pier and Newton. It also advised commuters to seek alternative transport.

> About 30 minutes later, SMRT said that the fault had cleared and train services were progressively being restored.

> Apologising for the incident just over an hour after the fault occurred, SMRT said that train services between Marina South Pier and Orchard had resumed, and free bus services would cease.

> [NSL]: Train svcs between #MarinaSouthPier and #Orchard have resumed. Free regular bus and free bus bridging svcs between #MarinaSouthPier and #Newton have ceased. We are sorry for affecting your Sunday morning commute. ‚Äî SMRT Corporation (@SMRT_Singapore) May 26, 2019
