Two foreigners going to harbourfront from ION, uncle quoted them $40. The queue that I‚Äôm in, nobody accepted the offer. 

Moments later, a 7-seater legit taxi (with the green taxi hood thing) slowly cruised by asking everyone in the queue once more... departing at $40.

I really don‚Äôt want to go into JB style where passengers need to ask every taxi in queue for the best price. It kinda ruin the environment... I feel.."

TL;DR at the end\~

**Assessibility:** üëç

\- 10 minute walk from Orchard MRT

\- Wifi a bit slow compared to the GV lounge one, cannot watch twitch :( probably due to the large amount of people using it 

\- Charging sockets can be found right below the table for easy access

\- toilet just outside the bar!

&#x200B;

**Comfort:** üëçüëçüëç

\-  Hotel mah so super comfortable chair with backing lol

\- table quite big, enough space for 4 coms + mouse

\- aircon also just nice, never get chills

\- dim lighting just enough to see comfortably

\- very awesome to fall asleep on. i sat on the lower chairs and they were huuge, big enough to curl up and fall asleep on (my friend fell asleep on it so i guess it is fit for a nap :D)

\- staff also super nice. made my day with their smiles :D

&#x200B;

**Price:** üëç

\- i signed up for the member thing so i can get the 10% off lol

\- altogether with service charge and GST, i paid $26.50 for 8 hours (U.P $29.50)

\- got free flow of coffee/tea and apple juice for non-caffeine people like me :D

\- also got one snack thing from the restaurant across. served around 10am. i got a curry puff and my friend got this spinach potato pie. both tasted super good. we both wanted seconds but too paiseh to ask lol

\- 30% off food from restaurant across. didnt want to take the chance of getting small fancy dishes for lunch so we went next door :P

&#x200B;

other stuff:

\- used to have to contact the hotel via whatsapp/email for booking but they changed it to be on their website and you can make payment on the website

\- customer service excellent. all the staff r rlly nice :D

\- shld b able to print your stuff (b&w only) as stated on website but i too paiseh to ask so i nv print LOL

\- also got complimentary mailing service but idk where to find also lol (maybe ask concierge) 

\- most of the people in the bar actually went out to eat lunch outside, leaving their valuables ~~totally not me as well~~ on their tables so my friend and i decided to follow suit. we ate at the mall next door ~~that only has a starbucks and that restaurant~~

\- by 5pm, literally noone left LOL poor staff :( left around 5.05pm so idk how long till they chase u out

&#x200B;

**Overall:** 4/5, -1 bc of the price lol. will come back when im no longer a broke kpop fan :)

84,9,As a fellow Singaporean. What do you think will rejuvenate orchard road?,14,8rvcau,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8rvcau/as_a_fellow_singaporean_what_do_you_think_will/,71,18-06-2018,"Sorry I don't have 1.3 mil to pay you. But as a Singaporean what can you contribute to rejuvenation of orchard road.
For me the road from Tang all the way to intersection before plaza Singapore should be car free. Only public vehicle should be allowed on weekdays. On Saturday and Sunday total vehicle free.. everyone should be able to make full use of the road. Performance arts etc should be encouraged right in the smack of the road.

That's for a start.. for now orchard road looks too commercialised.. everything is too fast paced.. you just want to get there do that and get out.. we need to slow the pace down."
