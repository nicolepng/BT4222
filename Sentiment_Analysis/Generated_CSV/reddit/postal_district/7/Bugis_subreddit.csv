1,6,[Un-sanity] I can't walk through Bugis MRT without downing a can of refreshing Coca-Cola afterwards,751,f1ovg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f1ovg4/unsanity_i_cant_walk_through_bugis_mrt_without/,82,10-02-2020,"Every day for the last few weeks, I walk by this advertisement in the transit area of Bugis MRT, and it's driving me crazy. It's a floor-to-ceiling Chinese New Year-themed commercial showing off ""Classic"" and ""No Sugar"" Coca-Cola. Now, I'd like to think of myself as somewhat of an independent, critical thinker, a true *zoomerlennial* who wasn't influenced by these kinds of simple visual corporate marketing tactics.

But I was wrong. You see, this ad was different. It was playing *music*.

It was a cheap and soulless melody, a generic jingle in a simple A-B-A musical composition, blasting from an economy-class pair of speakers. The first time I encountered it, I brushed it off as merely a mild distraction. And yet, as a week passed, I found myself beginning to exhibit... *unusual* behaviours.

I would unconsciously hum that annoying tune to myself, as I worked. I became hypersensitive to any sound of a canned drink opening, and spent work hours researching on whether Coca-Cola No Sugar was truly the Healthier Choice as they claimed. I caught myself taking long, wistful stares at an entire shelf of beautifully manufactured, glossy coke bottles at NTUC. The pounding within my heart reminded me of my JC days; it was the same feeling I had whenever my crush turned around, glanced and smiled at my right ear with her eyes slightly out of focus.

Chinese New Year arrived, during which the devil tempted my SAF-endorsed resilience and discipline with an endless supply of Coke (courtesy of my relatives). I could not bear the suffering any more. My pre-enlightenment self would've been embarrassed and ashamed to be defeated, but as I twisted the tab open and flushed the acidic liquid down my throat I felt only victory. It was euphoric; it was as if I was ready to love again.

My daily routine has since evolved. Seeing that now-familiar ad on the way to the East-West Line platform would fill me with hope for the day ahead, and a desire to quench my thirst for some freshly carbonated Coca-Cola™. Instead of my outdated habit of 0% sugar diet bubble tea, I would hydrate myself over lunch with what I now believe to be a superior health beverage — 𝕮𝖔𝖈𝖆-𝕮𝖔𝖑𝖆 No Sugar™. And at the end of a day of toil, as I made my commute in the opposite direction, I am reminded again that I am returning to a warm, cosy home, where I can crack open an ice-cold, refreshing can of ℂ𝕠𝕔𝕒-ℂ𝕠𝕝𝕒 ℂ𝕝𝕒𝕤𝕤𝕚𝕔® to take my mind off the troubles of the day.

I would like to thank the fantastic team at The Coca-Cola Company's marketing department for bringing me together with what I believe is the love of my life. Without that obnoxious ad with its percussive harmonies wearing down at my hardened, cynical mental barrier, I might never have known the joy I now possess. I would never have imagined that Coca-Cola would bring me happiness and (spiritual) prosperity, just like what that ad promised. I truly feel as if I have been born again, as if I had previously only been a physical shell who have now achieved an inner mental renaissance. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

Edit: There's an ***RSAF*** recruitment ad along the travelators now that's getting me real excited, anybody wants to sign on with me?"

7,6,To the man who asked me for money at Bugis Cube,160,lygvvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/lygvvj/to_the_man_who_asked_me_for_money_at_bugis_cube/,40,06-03-2021,"You came off at the bus stop I was waiting at with a purple shirt. For some reason, you had your stomach exposed because you folded your shirt upward.

But there was more that was exposed, you had dried splotches of blood on your face and plasma peeling from the bridge of your nose. You had a square bandage plastered underneath your mask.

I was pretty sure it wasn’t makeup so I gave you the benefit of the doubt.

You approached me asking for help and you told me you needed money to see a doctor in Lavender.

If I’m being honest, I was pressured to help when you told me about your motorcycle accident a few days ago but, the cynic in me had to fight.

Your speech was a little slow and I had to clarify what you were saying many times because it was too ambiguous.

I asked about which clinic you were going to and I looked it up on my phone. You didn’t even make sure it was the correct one before agreeing along with me.

Still, I couldn’t bring myself to give you money. I offered to take you to the MRT to buy you a ticket to Lavender but you focused on still needing money to see the doctor.

So I offered to bring you to your CC to ask for some help instead. I wasn’t even sure if they provided these kinds of services.

You told me you lived in Jurong West and that the CC said you had to wait two days before any aid could be provided.

I really had no clue what to do. I wanted to be patient and I asked you what you needed from me.

You finally told me you just needed money to see a doctor nearby and I offered to bring you there myself.

After that, there was nothing but an awkward silence and probably a glare I was too preoccupied to notice from my friends trying to tell me that we missed the bus we were supposed to take.

You even said to me that you weren’t a conman.

In the end, you just thanked me but I didn’t really know why when I didn’t help you at all.

You left the bus stop, moving to a crowd of people who just crossed the traffic right. 

I had a conflicting feeling of sympathy and slight disappointment when the crowd parted and ignored you.

Maybe it was just because you didn’t wear your mask properly. 

There was a man who you stopped who took out his wallet but I don’t think he gave you any money either.

By the time my bus came again, you were on the other side of the bus stop, probably telling another person. That was the last of you I saw.

-

I’m not sure why I’m thinking about this on the way home at night.

I asked the traffic light if I did the right thing and they said “I don’t know”.

Perhaps it’s because I always gave in just to avoid confrontation of all sorts. I hate picking up flyers that I have no interest in when I use an escalator, only to just throw them away at a nearby bin. 

I still don’t know how to feel about the $10 keychains I’ve stashed away in my drawer.

Some part of me wandered through my memories of glueing my eyes down at my phone as if I’m messaging someone whenever I walked pass someone selling tissue paper.

At least tissue paper is useful. Right? 

Anyway, that’s enough about me.

-

I hope your wife and two kids you told me about are alright. I hope the scabs on your face heal and don’t scar. And I hope you find the help you need."
