8,6,g52cynb,t3_irtzck,"> # 21-year-old who runs Hokkien mee stall at Golden Mile: 'I do believe young people can take hardship'

> PERSPECTIVE: The hawker industry is a cutthroat one, with long, gruelling hours and slim profit margins. But for one 21-year-old in Singapore, he shares why the effort put into running his hawker stall is worth it.

> Andre Ong first started frying Hokkien mee as a teenager while helping out at a stall his father worked at. That was the when Ong fell in love with the art of cooking.

> In 2020, a 21-year-old Ong opened Youfu Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodle at Golden Mile Food Centre, which he runs with his father.

> We sat down with Ong to find out more about why he chose to become a hawker, whether he's in it for the long haul, and why he's happy to work over 12 hours a day, six days a week.

> Here's how our chat went.

> You run Youfu Hokkien Mee with your dad. How long has your stall been around at Golden Mile Food Centre and why did you decide to open a hawker stall?

> We have been here since March and this is the first time my family has a stall of our own.

> This stall name, Youfu, is derived from my brother’s and my name. My brother is the You, and I am the Fu. My brother came up with half of the money, but he doesn’t know how to cook. I’m the one who has the passion for cooking. He’s the one who believes in me.

> Who came up with the idea to sell Hokkien mee?

> Me. I was really very sure when I was 16.

> 16????

> Yah really, 16. I told a lot of my friends that after NS I will be opening a Hokkien mee stall but they didn’t believe me.

> Why didn't they believe you?

> I also don’t really know… that’s a good question. (Interviewer: Is it because you always troll them or lie to them?) No lah, no lah! When I was young I was different. When I say things, people don’t take me seriously. I was very naughty as a teenager. When you’re immature, it’s like that. But now I’m different ah!

> Now they’re like, whoa I can’t believe you really opened a stall. They will congratulate me.

> Why Hokkien mee?

> It was the first dish that made me fall in love with cooking.

> Oh, so when did you discover your passion for cooking?

> When I was 14! I can remember. I went to help my dad, who was helping out at a stall in Changi Village. I didn’t really like being a cashier. Then, he asked me if I want to learn (cooking), I said, sure, why not.

> That’s when I developed a passion for cooking. He taught me how to fry Hokkien mee and I realised, wow, cooking is really an art.

> What’s funny is that, I didn’t take a cooking course in ITE. I took retail services. Everybody asked, ""Why didn’t you take cooking?!"" I said, I don’t know… I don’t see anything in studying cooking. It’s more hands-on for me. You go into the kitchen and that’s where you learn. Not in a course.

> You mentioned you would help your father out at the Hokkien mee stall in Changi Village. What was that like for you, as a secondary school kid?

> I have to go to school, so after classes I would go to help. Some days when I’m not lazy lah, (haha). But now is different!

> (Interviewer: Did you ever resent needing to help out back then?)

> To be honest, yes. Because I wanna spend time with my friends mah. It’s your youth! But I think at 18 years old I changed (my) thinking.

> What was it like learning the ropes from your dad? How long did it take you to pick up the skill?

> I have been frying Hokkien mee full-time only for half a year. It started out as preparing ingredients, or cashiering, before really learning to cook and fry.

> (Picking up the skill) actually wasn’t so bad for me. If you ask those who aren’t willing to learn or don’t have passion, they’ll take very long to learn. Every day I will practise frying, my dad will keep repeating and repeating and I will just follow. But that’s what the previous stall’s way of cooking -- now we will improvise.

> Actually you got to fry as you go… Really really! When I was learning, whenever a customer comes, I will just fry. That’s the reality what.

> (Interviewer: What about if you make mistakes, would your dad scold you?)

> Of course, every parent would nag or scold if their children makes mistakes. It’s normal. They do this so you will improve mah.

> Have you ever fried an order that was a complete failure? How did you feel?

> Wow…. Ya lah… I felt damn sad, really damn sad. Like you have all the ingredients and you spoiled it by doing this. Imagine you’re a customer and you want to eat the food but it tastes horrible. You’ll be disappointed! No chef wants their customer to be unhappy, they want to leave a smile on their face.

> (When I opened the Beach Road stall), I still got some failures lah. Ups and downs lor. Initially, our Hokkien mee was very wet, and not many customers liked it. Then the noodle was also a bit tougher like al dente, then old people cannot chew. So we adjust and improvise.

> What about now? Is the Hokkien mee that you cook different from your dad’s?

> The Hokkien mee my dad and I cook are a little different...Taste-wise, I think people can tell the difference. There are some customers who will say lah. But we try not to let it come between us. People have different preferences.

> If you like to cook, why not become a chef working in a restaurant or hotel? Why did you decide to become a hawker?

> I used to work at Providore at Raffles Place in 2018, for six months, before NS. It was a full-time job and I cooked pasta, pizza, Western food. More of the Italian type.

> But I think cafe food is very expensive mah and not affordable for some people. If I’m a hawker, I think everyone can try my food because it’s reasonably priced.

> What is a typical day like for you? What time do you get up, or come to the stall?

> I wake up at 6, and reach here at 7am. And I’m here all the way until 7pm. But after that we need to prepare stock for the next day, like we will prep some things for tomorrow, like the pork or minced garlic, in advance. I live in Serangoon North, it’s a 1 hour plus bus ride, so I reach home at 10+pm.

> We (my dad and I) both work six days a week, only Monday is an off day. From 7am until 7pm we are here. Our opening hours are at 10am, and we used to open until 10pm, but these days we close earlier once we sell out. Around 7pm.

> We used to open every day but we started having Mondays off only recently. Sometimes, if you don’t rest your body starts to work differently. You’ll be exhausted and angry and it’s very frustrating. It’s very very important to have rest. Health is much more important.

> Many businesses struggled during the Circuit Breaker period. How has the Covid-19 period affected your business? Some businesses have tried to market themselves online as well. Is that something you're doing?

> We’re on WhyQ. It’s not so bad, it’s very affordable for deliveries. I think we get like four to 10 orders from this app a day because not many people know about WhyQ.

> We opened our stall here and one month later, it was the Circuit Breaker. I think it was like hell. It was a really very, very tough period. We came and open the stall, ready to sell, but it’s a ghost town. There was nobody.

> There were some other stalls that closed. But we just used our money to hang on until the CB was over. But we have our losses!

> My girlfriend started our Facebook page, she’s the one behind the computer. We are also on Instagram, that’s run by my brother’s girlfriend. Ya, they’re the women behind the scenes.

> What are the highest and lowest points for you being a hawker?

> Lowest point for me… I don’t think I have any because I feel really happy cooking! Okay lah, lowest point is when I cook, then the customer don’t like because everyone have different tastebuds. Some people say not nice, but that was at the starting lah.

> (Interviewer: So would you say the high points for you are when someone tells you that your food is good?)

> Ya!! Not a lot of people will come over and tell you that it’s nice. So when you receive that type of feedback, you feel a sense of satisfaction.

> Most people just eat only what. They think we just (fry) this only. But ah, behind the scenes, wah a lot of things that we need to do. We need to cook our own chilli, cut everything, fry the pork lard. Sometimes the time is really not enough even though we come damn early.

> But it’s worth it?

> It’s definitely worth it.

> I think I want to be able to achieve my dream. There are so many people with dreams but they don’t want to chase it. My ultimate dream is to become the best chef in Singapore. (Interviewer: And how will you know when you are the best?)

> When I’m on the Top 10 chefs of Singapore list. (Editor's note: This is the list that Ong saw, and was determined to get onto.)

> So what’s next for you? Do you intend to continue studying in the future or what are your business plans?

> No, I wanna cook! If it’s what you like to do, you’ll never stop doing it.

> I wanna open other chains in the future. I’ve not decided yet but there’s plans. Definitely, long-term for sure. Even if I branch out next time, I will still do hawker food. But maybe with a twist, it’s a surprise lah!

> Some people say the younger generation cannot take hardship. What would you say to these people?

> Not all young people cannot take hardship la. I think spoiled people cannot take hardship. *laughs* No lah, no lah, it’s about how you adapt to things and react to things. But I do believe that young people can take hardship.

> It’s a lot of hard work. A lot of people don’t know one lah… but just have to stay humble.

> If you work hard, you can get what you want. I believe in hard work and smart work!

> SINGAPORE: Golden Mile Complex will be proposed for conservation in view of its ""historical and architectural significance"", said the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Friday (Oct 9).

> URA will also offer planning incentives to support the adaptive reuse and commercial viability of the building given its owners' interest in a collective sale.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The authority proposed to conserve the main building, with its ""signature terraced profile atop of the podium block"" as key features to be retained.

> ""There are opportunities to adapt the building for new uses, restore and transform it and the Beach Road precinct into a more vibrant destination where more people can appreciate its rich heritage,"" said URA.

> Located along Beach Road, the 16-storey building sits on one of the earliest government land sale sites. Golden Mile Complex, completed in 1973, got its name from the newly reclaimed Beach Road coined as the ""Golden Mile"".

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The building was designed by Singapore's pioneer architects, Gan Eng Oon, William Lim and Tay Kheng Soon, from home-grown firm Design Partnership, now DP Architects.

> It was one of the first large mixed-use developments in Singapore that combined commercial, recreation and residential uses in a single building, said URA.

> The authority also praised the building's structural ambition and the skilled construction methods needed to build its ""'terraced' floor slabs, slanted beams, towering columns and 'floating' staggered staircases"".

> ""Golden Mile Complex attracted a live-in population and visitors for recreation, as well as catalysed new developments along the Beach Road area.

> Advertisement

> ""The building continues to be a distinctive landmark and symbol of Singaporeans’ collective memories and the 'can-do spirit' of our pioneer generation during the post-independence years,"" said URA.

> CONSERVATION DECISION CAME AFTER ""EXTENSIVE"" TWO-YEAR STUDY

> The decision to conserve Golden Mile Complex came after an extensive two-year study that included engaging diverse groups of stakeholders and working with various agencies, said the authority.

> In recognition of its conservation merits and the building owners' interest in a collective sale, URA said it studied ways to conserve the building while supporting adaptive reuse and commercial viability, while also considering the feedback received.

> Besides the Heritage and Identity Partnership, input was also sought from building owners, heritage groups and industry players.

> The Heritage and Identity Partnership serves as a platform for dialogue between URA and its members. It also provides feedback and suggests ways to sustain and manage built heritage and identity.

> While there is strong support for Golden Mile Complex's heritage and architectural merits, building owners raised concerns over how conservation requirements could impact plans for a collective sale, given the associated building maintenance costs and design constrains, said URA.

> Developers also cited uncertainties surrounding the local property market's reception to purchasing a large-scale strata-titled conserved development - the first sale of its kind in Singapore.

> INCENTIVES FOR OWNERS AND PROSPECTIVE DEVELOPERS

> In response to these challenges, URA and relevant agencies are prepared to offer incentives to the building owners or prospective buyer-developers should the building be sold, the authority said.

> Incentives include bonus floor area, which will allow the building of an additional 30-storey tower within the existing site.

> There will also be a partial development charge waiver on the additional floor area and a development charge waiver for the enhancement in value of the conserved gross floor area.

> Other incentives include the option to top up the lease on the land to 99 years and the flexibility to adapt the building to a mix of possible uses.

> ""In addition, URA is prepared to work closely with owners and industry experts to facilitate adaptive reuse possibilities within the requirements of conservation,"" it said.

> Overall, more than 7,200 heritage buildings have been conserved islandwide, mostly dating from the colonial period, said URA.

> It added that as Singapore continues to progress, it will continue to engage Singaporeans on how to celebrate significant buildings from the country's ""recent past"" and facilitate a balance between heritage and development.

> The proposal to conserve Golden Mile Complex will be published on Saturday, and will be open to public feedback and comments from Oct 10 to Nov 8, 2020 at the URA Centre.

> The proposal can also be viewed online at the URA website.

It was a slow response starting from 1910s of a rebellion against ornamentation. By 1930s it was about democratising architecture, of cleanliness and futurism. After the ruination of WWII, such a clean concrete look started initially from the expediency of rebuilding ruined cities, in 1950s it became a socialistic gesture of mass housing for the masses. In 1950s it become the beton brute (raw concrete) style, which the term evolved to Brutalism. 

Starting from the 1930s architects were using concrete in an almost fetishising manner; creating forms which you cannot build with any other material. Which may partly explains why many concrete buildings during the 1950s onwards are very chunky, especially in Communist countries.

You don't need to get hit before it can be considered self defense. Getting up in someone's face like that is definitely good enough. If old man was just minding  his own business and the guy came out of nowhere and did that he would be within his rights to throw the first punch.

I have never really been to, or know the about the building, but i am always fascinated and intrigued by the architecture/design. It was until the day i saw the news about it potentially being sold and demolished, i finally know what is it called. Immediately i want to create this in Cities: Skylines, a attempt to preserve it(?) in this medium, and to share it with the rest of the world.

I hope this is a good representation of the actual building, with the limited references that i can find online to work with.

As i was working on this, there's a turn in the fate of the building. To my knowledge, the building stays for now, but i'm not sure till when.

> Instead of tearing down an ageing building, giving developers incentives to develop an old icon is progress, says Associate Professor Yeo Kang Shua.

> SINGAPORE: The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a rethinking of our built environment. With so many of us still working from home, we are once again questioning how we should be designing our domestic, work, and urban spaces.

> In Singapore, the way we look at redesigning homes or urban spaces has evolved over time too. Central to how privately owned architecture changes here is the collective sale, or what is known as en bloc redevelopment.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> This is where an existing old building is sold to a developer or consortium who then proceeds to demolish and rebuild.

> Since 1995, there have been 579 transactions marked by two periods of en bloc “boom” in Singapore. The first was between 2006 and 2007 - 250 transactions worth about S$20 billion - and the second was between 2017 and 2018 with 79 transactions worth about S$18 billion.

> Since then, the numbers have tapered off.

> Today, when we look at how to deal with ageing infrastructure, the question of sustainability comes into play. How long can we prolong the lifespan of what we consider to be important?

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Seen in this way, the proposal to gazette Golden Mile Complex for conservation is a paradigm shift of how we design and renew buildings going forward.

> COMPLEX CHARACTER OF OLD BUILDINGS

> The mixed-use Golden Mile Complex has drawn both accolades and criticisms. Those who oppose its conservation often cite the building as being old and dirty, requiring quite massive renovations.

> The building was originally called Woh Hup Complex as it was built by Woh Hup (Pte) Ltd. The 16-storey building was one of the first strata-titled developments in Singapore to have shops, offices and residences.

> Advertisement

> Completed in 1973, it is known for its “terraced” design – which enhances natural light and ventilation and three architects, Gan Eng Oon, William Lim and Tay Kheng Soon worked on this building.

> The supermarket started out as an Econ Minimart. Thai construction workers were a-plenty.

> Over the years though, as foreign workers congregated and the complex became known as “Little Thailand”, it struggled to find buyers – with hundreds of different strata-titled owners and a 99-year lease that began in 1969. Two attempts at collective sale in recent years fell through.

> Developers stayed away seeing it as too risky as there was no gross plot ratio assigned to the land in the masterplan, and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had announced in late 2018 when the first collective sale was ongoing, that the building is under conservation study.

> The former meant that it was unknown if developers can add extra floor area to the land, while the latter meant that until the conservation study was complete, there may be additional conservation regulations that will need to be complied with.

> Conservation is often seen as a hindrance to development, and vice versa. Like it or not, the relationship between development and conservation is strained and tenuous.

> From the perspective of the developers, conservation meant that they are restricted by how much extra floor area they may be able to add, on top of having to conserve the existing structure.

> It is more expedient both in terms of financial and time consideration that both owners and developers tend to opt for demolition and redevelopment.

> An example is the Pearl Bank Apartments. After a long and difficult campaign, 91 per cent of the strata-titled owners agreed to a voluntary conservation proposal by the building’s architect Tan Cheng Siong, which included the addition of floor area within the development.

> File picture of Pearl Bank Apartments near Chinatown which were completed in 1976.

> However, this meant that there will be changes to the aggregate share value of the lots in a Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST).

> For this to proceed, the existing MCST must be terminated with 100 per cent owner’s approval to allow for the reconstitution of a new MCST. Eventually, collective sales prevailed, and the building was demolished for redevelopment.

> Regardless of the building’s architectural merits, most owners are worried that their deteriorating properties, made worse by minimal planned maintenance, will have a considerable decrease in financial value should it attain conservation status.

> There are exceptions, as is the case of Tiong Bahru estate.

> Its art moderne heritage remains attractive for aficionados who are willing to invest precisely because of the neighbourhood’s architecture and historic character. In this case, the financial value, though important, need not be the main consideration.

> Art Deco-inspired walk up flats in Tiong Bahru.

> Furthermore, when a privately-owned building is old, owners are generally unwilling to spend on maintenance as they expect a collective sale in the near future.

> This is unlike HDB estates, which are regularly refurbished by the state at a highly subsidised rate.

> WHY THE GOLDEN MILE CASE IS SPECIAL

> The Oct 9 announcement to propose the gazette of Golden Mile for conservation is significant in that for the first time, the state is prepared to balance out the biases toward redevelopment by tilting the equation towards revitalisation.

> They have done this through the provision of incentives to private development owners or prospective buyers and developers, should the Golden Mile Complex be conserved.

> Many of these incentives are unprecedented. The extent and clarity of the incentives demonstrate the state's willingness to balance out various stakeholders’ interests, including financial viability.

> The incentives include a one-third increase in floor area, as opposed to the uncertainty of any allowable floor area increase previously and the adjustment of site boundary to facilitate a more regular and rational building footprint to accommodate a new 30-storey tower from the increase in floor area.

> What this signals is that costs of revitalisation are reduced or subsidised by the state to safeguard the common good of the country’s architectural heritage.

> File picture of Golden Mile Complex

> Revitalisation, regeneration, and redevelopment of buildings and real estate development can be mutually compatible. The real estate market expands, rather than contracts, with such a perspective.

> Conservation is not about keeping every single element intact and thereby subverting creativity. It is the creativity of our minds that will allow us to tap on to existing history and character, in redesigning our domestic, work, and urban spaces.

> Just as Golden Mile Complex is a symbol of the ingenuity of Singapore’s pioneer generation of building professionals and our bold urban living vision, its conservation will allow many to carry forth such spirit of resourcefulness, with the determination to create interesting and sustainable spaces within the parameters of our building stocks.

> Yeo Kang Shua is an Associate Professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. He is also President of ICOMOS Singapore – Singapore’s committee of the International Council on Monuments and Sites.

> SINGAPORE — The owner of a retail shop in Golden Mile Tower engaged two men to perform renovation works on his unit and entrusted them with the key.

> However, Loo Jiale, 32, and Peter Ngin, 52, took the opportunity to hold a drinking party at the shop with eight others during phase 1 of Singapore’s reopening after a partial lockdown.

> The party of 10 were busted by the police after an anonymous tipoff about an “illegal disco pub with sexy ladies going business during CB secretly open daily 24/7”.

> Loo was fined $8,000 while Ngin was fined $6,000 after each pleaded guilty to one count of meeting nine others outside of their residence for a purpose that was not for work or exceptional circumstances, but to consume alcohol together.

> Each Singaporean had a charge of leaving their residence without reasonable excuse taken into consideration for sentencing.

> The eight others involved are four Singaporeans: Ho Hua Heng, 51; Rainven Tan Choon Chye, 49; Kwok Kian Ghin, 56; Lek Guan Heng, 56, and four Thai women: Bunkhan Supapron, 33; Ob-un Wanwisa, 30; Ketthim Supatsara, 25, and Khamsam Wararat, 30.

> Each was fined $4,000 after they pleaded guilty to the same charge as Ngin and Loo, with the latter charge also taken into consideration for sentencing.

> Loo and Ngin had been hired by the owner of a retail unit in Golden Mile Tower to perform renovation works in April this year. The owner left the keys in the duo’s possession so that they could check for water leakage in the unit periodically. They were not given permission to use the unit for drinking sessions.

> Singapore entered a partial lockdown from 7 April which prohibited individuals from leaving their residences without a reasonable purpose, and also banned individuals from meeting those who did not live in the same households. Phase 1 of the country’s reopening started on 2 June, but individuals were still required to leave home only for essential purposes, with social gatherings prohibited.

> On 11 June, Loo entered the unit at about 12pm and invited Kwok, Lek and Bunkhan to gather for drinks. He also informed others via a group chat that he was at the unit and they joined him there, including Ngin at about 5pm, and Lek at about 7pm. Lek said he felt bored at home.

> Ho joined the gathering at about 4pm of his own accord, as he claimed to have felt “very stressed” at home as he was not working. Similarly, Tan joined even though he was not invited, as Ho had mentioned he was there.

> The four women joined at the invitation of the men or each other.

> A police report was lodged at about 9.50pm, with the anonymous caller stating that he or she “will go to social media” as there was no response after a report was made.

> At about 10.07pm, the police arrived at the unit and noted that it was a retail shop, not a disco pub as was stated in the police report. Officers knocked on the door until Loo answered three to four minutes later. Officers then spotted a closed door behind Loo and entered it, only to find the nine other accused persons seated around cups of beer and soju.

> A few crates of beer bottles were placed on the floor. Ngin and Loo had ordered 10 cartons of beer, costing $800, for the purpose of drinking during gatherings at the unit.

> Loo admitted that he had participated in two to three gatherings towards the end of April. He spent about 10 hours at the unit on 11 June.

> Submitting for fine amounts that were eventually imposed by the court, the prosecution said that the “frivolous” gathering did not have an agreed end time and would likely have continued if the police had not put a stop to it. The offence was hard to detect, which emphasised the need for deterrence.

> The prosecution sought the highest fine for Loo as he was the primary organiser and host for the gathering, while Ngin was one of the two who had access to the unit and could have prevented the gathering.

> However, Ngin too participated in the illicit gathering. The two men had a higher culpability than the other guests, said the prosecution.

> For contravening the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures)(Control Order) Regulations 2020, a first-time offender may be jailed up to six months or fined up to $10,000, or both.
