11,28,A calculation on how high Pasir Gadong buildings can be due to Seletar Airport's operations.,95,a5ifvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/a5ifvr/a_calculation_on_how_high_pasir_gadong_buildings/,46,12-12-2018,"The current argument from Malaysia is that with the ILS, Pasir Gudang cannot have buildings above a certain height.

Ignoring the issue of how Singapore can enforce this on Malaysian land, we can actually calculate the maximum height of buildings in Pasir Gudang before planes have to actively avoid them.

Heights on landing/take off planes can be calculated using trigonometry. tan(x) = Height / Distance. 

Yes, O Level math is actually useful. Go thank your math teacher now.

Glidescope paths are generally [3 degrees above horizontal ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_landing_system_glide_path). Singapore's Changi Airport also mostly use a 3 degree for it's glidescope paths. [\(Source: CAAS AIP 2018\)](https://www.caas.gov.sg/legislation-regulations/guidelines-advisory/air-navigation-services/aeronautical-information-publication-amendments)

Wolfram Alpha has the distance of Seletar Airport to Pasir Gudang at [2.3 nautical miles/2.7 miles.](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Distance+from+Seletar+Airport+to+Pasir+Gudang)

So: Tan (3 degrees) * 2 miles (I'm being generous here) = 168 meters/553.4 feet . Subtract 50 feet for obstacle clearance, we arrive at [500 feet or 152 meters.](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=500+feet+in+meters)

Notice that 152 meters is really [close to the 154 number reported by Anthony Loke.](https://www.malaymail.com/s/1702402/the-johor-singapore-airspace-conflict-why-malaysia-is-standing-firm)

Except that 152 meters is actually the base limit here in our calculation. In the report, the 154 meters is their UPPER limit. 

Just to have a clearer picture, 152 meters is the same as a [49.8 - 62.3 story building](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=152+meters+in+stories)

These are the facts. You make your own conclusions."

Apparently, there used to be 'Beware of crocodiles' sign there.

I spoke to a PUB electrician who said when he was doing cabling maintenance in the reservoir, a zoo staff accompanied them in case a crocodile attacked. He wasn't sure if the zoo staff was joking.

I recall that as a kid, I was by the reservoir catching fish at night and heard a distinctive roar/growling like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNg2VGKCv6k). I ran away when I heard it.

Curious if any of you ever saw, or know of crocodiles/alligators at the Seletar reservoir."

1) I heard that we will undergo UIP for 3 weeks and stay in @ camp, then we will undergo 3 months of stay out training, is this true?

2) I'm PES A, but I got posted to this vocation somehow (probably because I declared past drug usage), am I still entitled for the combat/risk pay?

3) Am I stuck at Seletar camp for the rest of my NS days? Or will I be posted out to another unit after my course?

4) How's the camp environment and people over there like?"
