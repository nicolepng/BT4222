Those are NOT distress calls you are hearing. What you are hearing is most likely a contact call, all birds do it from time to time to check whether other members of their flock are around. Depending on the species some birds may do it for hours on end, like lovebirds, and some parrots only make a few calls in the morning, afternoon and evening.",t3_k2dk3p,28-11-2020
23,3,gdud4xx,t1_gdu5d4i,"https://www.animalwised.com/4-signs-of-stress-in-parrots-2714.html

> The second **sign of stress in parrots is continued screaming**. It is also one of the most common causes of pet owners abandoning birds. Oral communication in parrots is a natural and common behavior. **When their vocalization becomes more acute and repetitive, it is often an alarm signal which the bird uses to call out in distress.** They may even be calling out to distant relatives who are not in their vicinity.

> When these cries become constant and repetitive for no apparent reason, it is abnormal and may be a sign of boredom or stress. It has been shown that parrots paired with other birds are less likely to develop these signs of stress. This is from a study carried out on young Orange-winged Amazon parrots in 2003[2].

Yup, calling out to your own species for hours and days on end and not receiving a response, definitely *totally* not distressing at all.

Looks like my comment above found the irresponsible parrot and macaw keepers.

Edit: and to answer your first question, there's a ""Birds Issue"" sub-category under Submit Case -> Animals & Birds, which I presume is for notifying NParks of possible pet neglect.",t3_k2dk3p,28-11-2020
24,3,gduiiqh,t1_gdud4xx,"1) They are not necessarily seeking out their own species. The birds will call to their own owners as well. 

The contact calls you are hearing are for their owners. Do the birds in your apartment actually call for hours on end? Since you say that your neighbour owns macaws, screaming is a given. And they have a morning call, an afternoon call and an evening call. All of this is NORMAL in parrots. Depending on the species, each call session may last up to an hour or a little over that. 

2) I mentioned that they are not seeking out their own species. Why is that? 

That's because a good number of parrots found nowadays are no longer wild caught. Yes we still get exports for certain species of parrot, i.e many Cacatua, Amazona and Psittacula species in the trade are still wild-caught. However, many of the macaws and conures, two of the more common birds found in the trade, tend to be from captive bred origins. In fact, we have a local breeder in Singapore for macaws, where most of the macaw owners in Singapore get their birds from. These parrots are hand-raised, therefore they imprint on humans. In this regard, they will often seek out their owners when they perform their calling. This is a behaviour that cannot be altered, however we can minimise how long the bird calls for.

If, you are absolutely postively sure that the birds in your area are distressed and are not performing their natural calls, then I will apologise. However, from a non-bird owner's POV, it is very easy to assume that the animal's natural behaviour may come across as distressing or abuse. 

Also, the Bird Issue under NParks is not for pet parrots. It is for ""nuisance wild birds"" such as koels, mynahs or parakeets that make their loud evening calls as they settle in for the night or for an overpopulation of birds like pigeons or mynahs near residential areas.",t3_k2dk3p,28-11-2020
25,3,gdufrbg,t1_gdud4xx,"Tbf you responded to the dude saying he could still hear the 'noise'.

He didn't define exactly what type of noise and now we have all this here.",t3_k2dk3p,28-11-2020
26,3,gdui4ml,t1_gdufrbg,"Well, you're right, I can't speak for the dude/dudette (I only know what I'm hearing on a daily basis are the distress squawks of a macaw), that parrot/macaw from across their street could totally be revving its motorcycle at 2am in the middle of the night, perhaps booming manyao in the process.",t3_k2dk3p,28-11-2020
27,3,gdunxm6,t1_gdui4ml,"Once again I ask you, how do you KNOW for sure that the birds are distress calling? How long does the call last? How frequent are the calls in between one another? What is the pitch of the call? 

This video explains what a contact call is as plenty of people often mistake a contact call for a distress/alarm call:

Because to someone who has 13-odd years on avian behaviour and husbandry (I personally keep birds and have worked with them in captive and wild settings, as well as worked as an avian trainer for awhile), what may sound like a distress call to you may be something that we know is totally normal behaviour for these animals.",t3_k2dk3p,28-11-2020
