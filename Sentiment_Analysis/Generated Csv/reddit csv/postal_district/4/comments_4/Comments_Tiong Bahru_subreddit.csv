Enjoy~

Thank you for all the awards! My friends and I are very happy you all like the video.

I'm not even surprised anymore. It reminds me of the PMD days when some ppl would paint it as if only a small minority of PMD users were causing problems... is it really just a small minority of cyclists? I hope so, but anecdotally I see quite a lot of this sort of dangerous behaviour by cyclists. One scenario I see fairly often is cyclists going at speed across zebra crossing or pedestrian crossings, if these cyclists are coming from behind a vehicle or from other blind spots (e.g. blocked by trees before the crossing), it's going to be very difficult for the driver to spot them in time.

To be fair, there are also a lot of drivers who do stupid shit but the difference is drivers will already be held liable by the law if need be, and also it's easy to identify from licence plate registration, etc.

I think it's high time to introduce more regulations for road cyclists. We need to be able to hold errant road cyclists accountable, so some form of registration and identification should be a good start. Maybe make it mandatory for them to pass BTT too (or a scaled down version of BTT) - if they're going to be on the roads regularly, why not make them pass BTT like other road users?

I think it is recognised that our existing road infrastructure is not very cyclist-friendly, but at the same time cycling plays a part in creating a more eco-friendly and car-lite transport system. So there is that tension, but that doesn't mean we should just throw up our hands and let things be till road infrastructure catches up.",t3_kubrs9,10-01-2021

I've no idea where these people's sense of entitlement comes from. Some even ride in the middle of the bus/last lane. 

IDK is it naive of me to assume most of these road cyclists should have drivers license, considering many of them ride thousands of dollars-worth bicycles, they might own cars too?

I would like to think that it’s just a minority of errant PMD users who have zero regard for pedestrians’ safety but whenever I walked in my town in Tampines, all the PMD users would zoom by at top speed with ZERO warning, often carrying large bags and missing pedestrians by mere centimetres. I empathise with those who use it for deliveries but it is no excuse for frankly dangerous and unsafe driving behaviour on PEDESTRIAN walkways. Tampines is a cycling town and there are bikes on the walkways but there are differences: the cyclists can’t accelerate as fast as electric PMDs and cyclists would slow down and ring the bells.

The problem to me is that we still don’t have proper cycling etiquette. I stayed in the Netherlands for a while and everyone bikes here. Everyone knows to raise their hands to signal when they are turning. Cars are also more careful of bikes on the road. Granted, we don’t have a biking culture in SG, but schools need to teach kids how to bike safely and responsibly. It’s not hard.

Edit: I don’t think we should have a BTT for cycling lol. It’s very cumbersome and imposes administrative and financial hurdles for a green mode of transportation that should be accessible to all.

I can’t quite recall. What I’m saying is just that there should be a short segment on proper cycling etiquette. It wouldn’t take more than a few minutes haha. But at least the kids would know what they should do if they cycle, for their safety and others’.

This shouldn’t be a school thing, but a governmental initiative. Maybe collaborate with existing bicycle shops to educate. Or maybe responsible parents should educate their kids instead of pushing it to the Teachers.

EDIT: Pretty hilarious how posts that suggest parents should take responsibility for their kids are downvoted. Stop outsourcing your responsibilities to Teachers.",t3_kubrs9,11-01-2021
239,3,givx0db,t1_gittdy5,"Lmao people aren’t trying to make life hard for teachers or suggesting that we outsource parental responsibilities. What you said is right in an ideal situation. The problem is that parents themselves don’t even know the proper cycling etiquette because our society doesn’t have a biking culture. People are merely suggesting the most practical way to address the solution in the longterm which is education — both for the public and in schools. Idk what kind of “cycling culture lessons” you assumed I was suggesting lol. No one said anything about an extensive class or exam on this 🤦🏻‍♀️ A simple 10-15min segment in a CME class on safe cycling etiquette would suffice imo. At least kids would be aware of what to do (raising their hands to signal, using night lights, etc), which is better than the current situation of ignorance. And they would tell their parents what they learnt. This bottom-up CME is how we as a society are addressing issues like casual racism that the older gen are less aware of.

Btw, it’s kinda disconcerting that you seem to imply that such CME topics aren’t important, just because there isn’t enough time to “teach finish all the subject content”. Of course the acad subjects are important but tbh our schools could do with less rote teaching and more CME discussions among students (not necessarily this cycling issue lol).

About people downvoting... it might help if you weren’t so sensitive and quick to jump to the wrong conclusions 🙃",t3_kubrs9,11-01-2021
240,3,giy0ii8,t1_givx0db,"Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to imply that learning cycling etiquette isn’t important. Nor was I trying to imply that CME topics are not important. If I did, I wouldn’t have mentioned “subject content **and CE lessons**”. 

In my limited opinion, the number of people utilizing bicycles on our roads as transport is just not big enough to justify a nationwide incorporation of cycling etiquette lessons in our schools. Doesn’t matter if it’s a mere 10-15 minutes like you suggested. 

A more practical solution would be to provide education through shops that merchandise bicycles, directly to the people who are purchasing them. 

You talk about long term education, but I don’t think the government plans to develop on-road cycling infrastructure (e.g. additional lanes for bicycles on roads) in the near future. The aim has always been to connect our towns with PCNs to facilitate intra-town connectivity, or for people to use bicycles as a last-mile transport from MRTs to their workplace via cycling paths beside pedestrian pavements. This is unlike cycling friendly countries like the Netherlands like you’ve lived in before, our roads here don’t have cycling lanes, and will not have them in the foreseeable future. 

https://www.mot.gov.sg/about-mot/land-transport/cycling

EDIT: u/tbmasterplace also had the same sentiments - Education is good, but asking for this to be incorporated into school curriculum does not make sense, given that only a minute portion of students will ever need this. Also, I don’t think he/she was referring to “physical cycling lessons”.",t3_kubrs9,12-01-2021

> About 300 members of Singapore's newest political party and volunteers also concurrently fanned out across the island, visiting all 29 constituencies.

> Dressed in red polo T-shirts with a palm tree logo, they reached out to the Sunday breakfast crowd with balloons and pamphlets, shaking hands and taking photos with residents.

> ""It's nice to see people come by occasionally, so I took the chance to say hi to Cheng Bock,"" she told the media.

> When asked if she was concerned about the PSP's presence in her ward, Ms Indranee said that serving the residents is her priority, and that when the time comes, they will decide for themselves who they want to represent them in Parliament.

> Dr Tan, a former long-serving MP of the ruling People's Action Party, told the media he was happy that his encounter with Ms Indranee ""was not confrontational"", and hoped that there could be less of the ""if you're not with me, you're against me"" mentality in local politics.

> From Sunday's walkabout, the PSP secretary-general observed that people were still not fully aware of the PSP yet because it is new.

> For example, when they received the pamphlets, if they did not turn to the side with his face on it, they would not have known what it was about at all.

> Mr Kelly Ng, 48, who runs 63 Laksa stall at Ghim Moh Market and Food Centre, said he would wait for the campaigning to begin and hear what policies the party presents before making a decision about them.

> It was also revealed on Sunday that the PSP's policy team consists of more than 30 members and is headed by assistant treasurer Hazel Poa.

> She said that the party's policies and manifesto will not address all of the issues that were raised at the party launch in August, which included job creation, the voting age and ministerial salaries, among others.

> ""Obviously, we are going to look at different areas comprehensively, because the election is going to be rather soon,"" said Ms Poa. ""We will need to decide subsequently, which are the areas we want to make our main call, but that is something that we can only decide closer to election time.""

> When asked if any progress had been made since the agreement by seven parties in July last year for him to lead a coalition, Dr Tan said that he had accepted it back then, as he thought ""getting together is a good thing"".

> ""I didn't say I will accept the form (of collaboration). I was not saying that whatever they proposed is the right one,"" said Dr Tan.

> However, he said that he still will not rule out a coalition, but the opposition parties need to first maintain a relationship of understanding, and party leaders needed to convince their own members to get on board with any decision made.

These meals are worth much more than what it is priced as it requires a lot of labour and being strict on what goes in. The govt should create a heritage mechanism where they can raise the price and give out food stamps to those who cannot afford the higher prices.",t3_be6brk,17-04-2019
