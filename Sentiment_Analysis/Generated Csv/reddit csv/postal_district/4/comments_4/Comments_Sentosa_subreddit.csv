In any case, it would reason that there would have been some fortification there, even if they were basic at best. 

A lot of countries underestimated the Japanese forces. They were a formidable enemy at that point. The jungles of Malaysia should have held them up a bit. It wasn't until PNG, where the Asian sphere was considered remotely relevant, compared to the European sphere. 

The plans Imperial Japan had for the region were ambitious. They intended to establish a bullet train route from Tokyo to Singapore, through China, Indochina, and Thailand. This was before jet engines were properly developed.

Did any of your grandparents who served ever talk about their experiences of the War? My Grandfather served in the Battle of Morotai (in Indonesia), but apart from that, I know nothing else of his experience. He left Australia never having touched a beer, or a cigarette, and returned home as a chainsmoker, and a heavy drinker. The housing estate where he lived in after the war, was part of ""Housing for Heroes"" scheme. The street comprised of former Sergeants, and other fairly high ranking soldiers.

Even among Allied countries, the impression is that other countries' troops do the majority of the fighting, and the Americans follow afterwards, and claim credit for it. The ""arrogant American"" stereotype was apparent during WWII when Australia hosted American troops. The host countries were supposed to be ""thankful"" for US assistance. Eventually, people had enough, and you had riots like ""Battle of Brisbane"" etc.

These stories are very easy to read and understand,.  are beautifully illustrated in full color pictures and text,.  and can be read in over 280  different languages.   This is the perfect time to reach your children with the Gospel  message.   It will change their lives forever;.  and it will give you overwhelming joy in your heart when they finally pray with you to welcome Jesus Christ into their heart as their Lord and Savior.   Start reading these stories to them TONIGHT;.  and then watch as they quickly grow in their knowledge of the Bible,.  and become new creations in Jesus Christ our Lord!

Beloved in Christ Jesus.   All you need in order to do this ministry is your iPhone.   Simply gather the children into a circle,.  and start reading the New Testament stories to them on the Bible for children.org website.   Be sure to show them the pictures as you scroll down frame by frame and read the text;.  and take the time to explain to them what the stories are all about.   The children will love the stories,.  and will learn the Gospel very quickly.   You will receive God's richest blessings when the children finally pray with you to receive their Messiah Jesus as their Lord and Savior.   May Almighty God bless you,.  your friends and family,.  your ministry,.  and all of the children that you reach out to with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.   Amen.  

My friend in Christ Jesus.   Thank you so much for your love for the children of the world.   We need to reach out especially with the Gospel message to all the children who speak many different languages,.  who live in many diverse and far away  places in many different countries around the world;.  and who still do not have Bibles,  crayons,. or coloring books,.  or even know anything about Jesus.   We need to let our friends in other countries know that they can now use the Bible for children.org website as a great teaching tool in order to reach these children.   Jesus has told us to spread the Gospel message to every country in the world.   And God has given us the technology  with which to do it.   My beloved friend,.  I pray that you will help take the message of the cross to these forgotten about children,. so that when Jesus returns,.  they will be waiting for Him with open arms and shouting His name from the housetops.   The Bible for children.org website keeps adding more languages in which these stories can be read.   Please pray with me that these delightful Gospel stories will someday reach the heart,  mind,. and soul of every child on the face of the Earth,.  and that these children will absorb His love and accept His offer of eternal salvation.   May Almighty God lead you and guide you in service to Him.   In the loving and mighty name of Jesus,  I pray.

I used to go to Sentosa every weekend to play volleyball in the late 2000s-mid 2010s. the sandy white beaches were just as advertised, there was a good amount of beachgoers but not too crowded, and it was a nice place to hang out in general.

i stopped going for many years and when i went back last year i was so disappointed. Sentosa had become so crowded and everything was so commercialised. The queues to get onto the monorail were longer than the peak hour mrt wait for god's sake. Instead of people enjoying the sand and the sun, you get tourists in big floppy hats taking selfies and loud, obnoxious ""festivals"" with horribly overpriced food.

Sentosa used to be my refuge from the crazy city life, but now it's as bad as orchard road on the weekends. Thankfully i've found other places in Singapore that allow me the same peace and quiet.

The reality is that MSF Singapore‚Äôs clarification will NEVER viral the way the original criticism did. A number of folks sent the post to me because the individual who had posted it had taken the opportunity to attack me. Some sent to me to flag it up for my attention and asked me to help the lady. Some taunted and mocked me.

I have no regrets about the work I do on this front. I used to share more because it helps us understand the complexities better but more critically it was to encourage folks to be proactive and approach people who appear to need help.

But obviously I post less on the people I meet and assist because I know what the mob would do with it. My advice still remains. If in doubt, provide assistance. It‚Äôs ok if we are ‚Äòtaken for a ride‚Äô because you never know, it may well have been critical. Speak to them, listen, find out more, take down details and let us know so that we can follow up and verify. Things aren‚Äôt often as it seems but we will help where needed. Don‚Äôt just take an image, write and slam but yet nothing structurally is done to help the person. Often, if things sound quite so bad, there is definitely help available.

I believe that if it was just a normal post to make known her plight, but later clarified with the actual facts, there wouldn‚Äôt be such a hoo-ha. Apologise, clarify that he was merely repeating what was relayed to him, and move on. 

THE PROBLEM HERE was that it was not JUST an awareness post. He emotionally charged it to be a political one, linking to the issue of minimum wage, shitting on public servants wages, shitting on celebrating the Singapore spirit, shirting on policies. He used the information as a premise for his argument. Problem now is that his premise is completely debunked, which inadvertently destroys the credibility of his argument.

When I read through his Twitter posts, I was on the fence because it all sounds very CSB when she says Mindef did not pay her compensation for her son who passed away. This first point is already a red flag.

Then the part about where she earns 5$ after deducting cpf is also another true story which I have no doubts on it. There are indeed many low income earners, especially after CPF.

But this also raises the point of a SPR vs SC. If the Auntie was a SPR, the pay would have been higher with reimbursement from Workfare. The 5 will be bumped up more. 

So should we go and help out Auntie who is a SPR? Why did she not take up SC? What are the assets she own in Malaysia? Any car or bungalow there? These are the things we don't know and the original OP doesn't know. 

Imo, most PG generation always exaggerate their living conditions, I don't know why but it's their pattern if you spoke to any of them. 

Moving back to the OP, it makes you wonder how sheltered the original OP was. Was the auntie the first low income earner he met to warrant him to do the social media post?

340,3,fzmqk5s,t3_hzyzqe,"social media is a horribly dangerous tool to propagate such stories. it often doesn't take into account the needs and preferences of the people it claims to help, and it can be VERY distressing. i've witnessed first-hand the impact where reporters hassled somebody until they almost had a full mental breakdown because some 'well-meaning' member of public put full details up online.

if you see an individual or family that needs help, counselling support, financial support -- ask for their permission, help them to call Comcare or direct them to their nearest Family Service Centre to seek support. you can google to locate the nearest one to the person's address. if they're in imminent danger such as at risk of suicide, get them to reach out to SOS or IMH mental health crisis line.  or call the police if there is very real danger or risk.

DO NOT TAKE TO SOCIAL MEDIA. most people are unable to take thousands of people name-calling them or coming forward to show up as 'help'. or  media turning up to harrass them, etc. a normal person with no issues can frankly go insane from it overnight. think about it before you put things up online.",t3_hzyzqe,29-07-2020

A more personal update to my friends, and members of the public who care enough to chance upon this: (Disclaimer: lengthy post and might be emotionally charged and contain some uncensored expletives.)


1) The entire post started off as recounting of a heartbreaking personal experience on my STRICTLY PRIVATE Instagram account. There was never any intention for it to be shared, much less for it to have exploded on Facebook and Twitter in the way it did. The public has commented on how political it was towards the end. But I think I can rightfully ask for some fairness in understanding that it was a private post containing personal opinions. Which is my entitlement. Which also explains the expletives in it.

2) When I shared the screenshots of my Instagram story on Facebook, it was at the request of a few friends so that people will know more about Ah Umm and her story (which ended up turning out different, but more on that later) as well as highlighting the issue of the poor in our country. Upon much deliberation upon the possible good that could come out of sharing, I decided to share it in its entirety, including the political parts, simply for the sake of convenience and continuity. 


3) The past two days have been unexpectedly stressful and the pressure from significant public attention and scrutiny has piled on me me significantly. Close friends probably know me as somebody who isn't often deterred by naysayers and somebody who powers through hate. But constant exposure to negativity and doubt gets anybody down, I'm no exception. Pro-tip to anybody who may experience something similar like this in the future: disable all your Facebook/ socmed notifications. It really helps. Trust me. My only regret was not doing that sooner. 

4) There has been SO MUCH hate and doubt in the comments section it's unbelievable. There are people saying that I made the story up, either entirely or parts of it. There are people saying I'm doing it for clout and attention. There are people asking me why I only give her $2 and not $50. There are people doubting my intentions, saying that I never had the intention to help her. The most deluded even go as far as to say she never existed, and I made her up as part of a political smear campaign. I really don't know what to say to that la, you.. ownself go and reflect.

Nevertheless, this is me here saying for the record that there was not a single lie in whatever I said. Whatever I said and reported was whatever was told to me 1:1. Burn me on the stake or hook me up to a lie detector, whatever ah guys. I stand by what I said. As for my intentions, I have two: the first, is to help Ah Umm to the best of my abilities, in whatever way I personally know how. The second, is to highlight to people that she is just a symptom of a sick and flawed system that is still in much need of improvement. It's as simple as that, let's not make it more than it is. But if people choose to twist the truth and cast doubt on my intentions, well... people can think and say what they want. Luckily for me I know well there is nothing I need to prove to anybody. People who know me know me. And also, the allegations that said I did it for clout.. nah sorry I don't fuck with that. Like I tweeted, if I had a dollar for each person in the comments section of my Facebook post saying I did what I did for the sake of clout, I would actually have clout. To use somebody's plight for the sake of clout -- no thanks, hard pass.

5) As you guys should already know from the public update I gave linked here (please share if you haven't, it's REALLY important);

after talking more in-depth with Ah Umm with another volunteer, it turned out that the story she told me.. wasn't entirely accurate. I didn't ask her for an explanation or probe further, because she's already been through a lot of public attention and stress from this episode, and undeservedly so. I feel bad for that. I apologised to her for that, and she graciously said, ""‰∏çË¶ÅÁ¥ßÂï¶"". We have to remember this is an old lady on medication for a chronic heart condition. Have a bit of empathy ah please. At this juncture it doesn't really matter why. As long as she is okay and doing fine, then it's fine by me. 

I correctly predicted that upon the update, massive backlash would be upon me calling me a liar and saying that it was all bogus: in the past hour since the update I posted I've already received multiple comments from people on soc med saying I lied, without using any critical thinking skills to realise that if it were true that I lied, not posting the update would actually be in my favour. Nonetheless, once again, people can think and say what they want, and there is no way for me to prove my honesty to the public that will not involve them attacking Ah Umm's honesty as well. Instead I will say shame on those doing the latter. 
 
6) But hey, not everything that came out of this is negative! I am so lucky to have many good friends show me support in this period of time, got to make a new acquaintance from a charitable organisation, and many members of the public have said many kind words of affirmation to me, which really makes a difference. If you are one of these people, thank you! I apologise if I haven't been able to get back to everybody's DMs on all my social media platforms; they have all been flooded so far. All these like-minded and kind individuals give me hope that the best times for this country I love so much is still yet to be. 

I am also especially flattered to everybody who has sent me friend/ follower requests on Facebook and Instagram. Unfortunately, I will have to turn down all your requests, because of two reasons: firstly, I have a strict policy of only restricting my intimate social media accounts with people who I know in real life/ am actually friends with. I have tried to personally respond to every single one of you who have sent me follower/friend requests to turn you guys down as politely as I can, but if I haven't gotten to you, please attribute it to incompetence rather than malice. Really too much to go through one by one. For those who don't mind expletive-laden, super left wing and highly biased political commentary, you can always follow me on my public Twitter account instead! 

Secondly and more importantly, you guys have to understand something super important: this is not about me. It was never about me, and please do not make it about me. I'm just a messenger, but the message is acknowledging a broken system, and fixing our country systematically instead of symptomatically, all the while still not forgetting to consider the dignity and modesty of those we want to help. Force-feeding healing medicine is still cruelty. They are human beings too, and we ought not to forget that. 

If you have made it up to here, thanks so much for reading, and hopefully this brings me some closure to the entire incident. I promise that I will continue to fight for what is right, for those in our society who need it most. Hopefully, with some tact and some luck, I'll get better and better at it, and I get to help more people like Ah Umm.",t3_hzyzqe,29-07-2020

354,3,fzmhutq,t3_hzyzqe,"I hope people can let this case rest now. There's no point trying to find someone to place the blame on. We should just move on, but with the lessons learnt here. 

The main issue isn't whether help is available. 
There are definitely schemes in place for those who are less fortunate, or are in difficult situations. 

The main issue is outreach and exposure. 
Many of those who do not receive the help they need do not know about the help they can get. That, or they do not know how to go about doing so. 

Being unaware, they do not seek help and hence fall through the cracks. That is inevitable. If people do not speak up, it is difficult for their circumstances to be known. It's always easier said than done.

I mean, social services do actually have outreach programmes, and they do actually help. But sadly, they are also very limited in their abilities. 

Hence, if we really want to help, what we can do to help is to encourage people to reach out. Give them the resources to do so. Or contact the relevant authorities to reach out to them to help. Let it be known that it is okay to reach out. There's nothing wrong with that.

It is very important that this is shared so members of the public will refrain from continuing to approach her at her workplace ASAP. She has already been engaged by multiple members of the public and various organisations, and has been made known of our intentions to provide her with any aid she might require. She thanks everybody for their concern and kind offers, but also kindly turned us down and has requested to be left alone. Let us not cause her any more undue stress. I hope we can kindly respect her wishes. Thanks everybody. 

This post will be an update on the entire situation with Ah Umm in the past 2 days since her story went viral. The intentions of this update are: 

1. Updating members of the public on her current situation, as well as 

2. An advisory for all of us moving forward from here on out. 

This update will be entirely focused on her, and I will try my best to keep the reporting as neutral as possible. Everything said in this post is reported as it was told to me first-hand, as it was in the previous post.


On Tuesday (28th July), I headed down to her workplace first thing in the morning with the intention to contact Ah Umm. Unfortunately, her colleagues told me when I inquired, it was her off-day and she did not come to work. It was also told to me that despite being there at 9am the following morning, I was not the first person to have asked about her; the earliest respondents actually came down the night before to seek her out, but she had already knocked off work. I decided to try again the next morning after enquiring about her working hours.

On Wednesday (29th July) I headed down to her workplace again, and linked up with another volunteer who was already there waiting for Ah Umm before her shift started. When Ah Umm arrived at work, we told her of our intentions to offer her help. As far as we know, she personally does not own a mobile phone, followed up with providing her with our contact details.

When we engaged her, she recounted to us that she has been approached by many members of the public, even at her place of residence. As it turns out, she does have a son and daughter-in-law living with her, and does not live alone with other friends, contrary to what she told me before. She thanks everybody for their concern, but is personally feeling very stressed out by the unwanted and unexpected attention. She kindly turned down our offers of help, and repeatedly insisted that she is coping fine. 

For the sake of acting in her best interests, I implore everybody to respect her wishes to be left alone, so as not to cause an elderly person any more stress, or possibly even risk her losing her job from the constant attention she receives at her workplace. Thanks everybody. Please share.",t3_hzyzqe,29-07-2020

Elderly Singaporeans do find pride in working and maintaining their own source of income, even if they have children (or the government) to support them. I don't think this concept should be particularly foreign to younger Singaporeans either: just think about the first paycheck you received from your part-time job ‚Äî there's a big sense of achievement and independence. Many elderly Singaporeans also eschew retirement because they think that staying at home with nothing to do accelerates dementia and death. 

All these can be reasons why an auntie who is supposedly living well still feels the need to find a job. It's not for fun per se, but for a sense of independence and autonomy. 

And for the latter half of your statement about complaining to a stranger on the train, we don't know what exactly she told the OP, and how much the OP misrepresented her story for virality and clicks. I also won't negate the possibility of slight dementia on her part too.

Firstly, I think the detail about 5 room flat, maid, supplement income are all very suggestive. It suggests that the old lady wasn‚Äôt one who had fallen between the cracks, but i think there is definitely many different factors that would make us think differenly - is there an ill family member or Anyone with disabilities in the family; how is the household family income like; you can‚Äôt say these are sensitive and the details presented aren‚Äôt, and all of these would help paint an even better picture of the situation. Not to mention how the older gen is also one who thinks face is very important; i wouldn‚Äôt rule out her downplaying her current economic situation to save face, because let‚Äôs face it, we wouldn‚Äôt head down to an area we are unfamiliar with when illiterate, if not in true need. 

The Ministry could have stopped at, PR, family income/elligibility based on citizenship made them not qualified to apply for xxx but they are eloigible for xxx and we have aided them for xxx.

People fall through the cracks because MSF's evaluations are sometimes not comprehensive enough. If they used only family income + citizenship to evaluate someone's need for help, we will see a lot more Singaporeans in financial distress. 

Factors like size of housing, ability to hire domestic help, and supplementary income from family members are important for a holistic evaluation of someone's financial need. MSF will look at a case where an elderly parent is estranged from their adult child very differently from one where the parent is still on good enough terms with their adult child and receiving money from them. I am glad that MSF is moving towards such a model, to ensure that that fewer people fall through the cracks. 

Other factors that are also considered by MSF include disabilities and ill family members. The assumption I'm making here is that these factors did not apply to her, and hence were deemed not relevant to mention in a Facebook reply.

In this case, he could have simply caveated his post, or alerted MSF on her behalf first before posting. But he did not. Instead, he took her story as the gospel truth and doubled down on using it to bolster his own claims.

Also, if you are concerned about anyone losing their job, you should be more worried for the old lady. In TCJ's post, he shared that the old lady's boss has stopped contacting her.

That would best be the case. I might be doubting a little too much; but given that firstly, public assistance schemes are pretty rigid at times (not to mention that you really have be earning rather little toqualify) Auntie‚Äôs son might be earning enough for the household to not qualify for assistance, but spending to the extent where she needs the money for her own expenditure, and secondly, mostly because I think that she would not travel out of her comfort zone, i have nodoubt that it would be very scary to do so when she isn‚Äôt literate, unless she really needed to. And thirdly also with the factthat the older generation such as her might lie in terms of whether they need help, as they frown upon social assistance and wish to save face.

There was never any intention for it to be shared, much less for it to have exploded on Facebook and Twitter in the way it did. The public has commented on how political it was towards the end. But I think I can rightfully ask for some fairness in understanding that it was a private post containing personal opinions. Which is my entitlement. Which also explains the expletives in it.

Blaming the ruling party for every single problem you see is extremely harsh, and shows a complete failure to understand the complex nature of politics and policy. What society doesn't have people who fall through the cracks? This is a completely one-sided argument that doesn't address *why* actual policy isn't working, or discuss improvements in a balanced way *at all*. The entire basis for the anti-PAP rant is ""look at these poor people, this is all the ruling party's fault!!!"". When you expect perfection, disappointment is all you'll ever have. But when the ruling party's biggest justification for why you should vote for them is based on past results, which they rarely ever admit to failing to achieve (see: Josephine Teo), they open the door for such criticisms. Add lots of tone-deaf statements, and seemingly out of touch candidates, and you end up with a PR disaster waiting to happen. Because let's face it. There are people who justify their political views on a purely/mostly emotional basis. You can't appeal to just reason and not emotion. 

The thing about National Day shows an extreme lack of understanding about what it means to love your country, but when so much of Singapore's national narrative is based on ideas of success and prosperity, how do you expect people to fully separate national pride from economic success? When you try to justify national pride with security and prosperity rather than a shared culture, values or identity, you end up with national pride that's shallow, and easy to lose. When so much of national day is about celebrating ""the Singapore story"", how is it surprising that those who disagree can't celebrate?",t3_i0ea87,30-07-2020

This whole episode has been unsatisfactory. The person who made the instagram post did not get the full story or attempt to verify the details or even ask the lady's permission before posting online. The explanation post by MSF is almost as uninformative as it says the elderly lady is tired of public attention then goes on to list a ton of personal information about her.

Just to add another perspective here. My maternal granddad grew up dirt poor and my mum's family remained pretty poor until all the kids grew up and started working. Grandparents now live in a comfortable 4-room HDB with their own maid, and can easily afford to retire and travel and whatnot from the monthly allowances all the kids give them. Granddad however, *hated* retirement, and chose to start working again as a gas station pump attendant. It has pretty long shifts, is outdoors, and doesn't pay all that much, but despite all his kids' attempts to get him to rest and relax, he insists he prefers to keep working to earn money. 

Point here is, it's not a matter of all elderly working because they want to, or all elderly working because they need to. Truth is, it falls within that spectrum.",t3_i0ea87,30-07-2020

The biggest downside to minimum wage is unemployment. Basically, it's simple math.

Let's say you're a restaurant owner and you can only afford to spend $70 an hour on your staff. Without minimum wage, you can hire 10 workers and pay them $7 an hour each. Pretty standard for F&B.

Now there's a minimum wage of $10 per hour - means you can now only hire 7 workers. That's 3 workers who are out of a job now. As a rational business owner, who would you hire to do the job? Are you going to spend that $10 an hour on an able bodied teen, or an 82-year-old like the auntie here?

You can say that the restaurant can just increase price to make up for the diff so that they can still hire 10 workers. But increase price means decrease the demand, so less ppl would buy your food and you might not make the same amount as you started with. Or you could say restaurant can just hire 10 ppl anyway, but F&B already has shit profit margins and this won't help.

All in all, got a lot of reasons for and against minimum wage. It's not a magic fix to the income problem for low income workers.",t3_i0ea87,30-07-2020

Chicken rice wont increase from $3/$3.50 to $7-10 just because of minimum wage. The most is just add 10 cent to the price of chicken rice. The current Workfare scheme is funded by tax-payers money which is part of the government justification to increase gst to 9%. From what I had learnt in economics, minimum wage seems like a more complete scheme than our current Workfare scheme in terms of coverage. I do not suggest the rate of min wage to be as high as Aus. Aus has the highest min wage in the world. The $1300/month proposed by WP is pretty reasonable. I know there might be some financial burdens on the unemployed/retired old aunties and uncles due to higher cost but this also encourages them to work in minimum wage jobs to provide extra support for themselves. Most small businesses in Singapore are actually capable of paying min wage while still breaking even in their businesses. Those small businesses that are unable to hire SCs at minimum wage could apply for exemption to for example, $1000/month and it will be processed on a case by case basis, just like how covid-19 support grant are processed but on business level. The reason why min wage is for SCs only is because those service jobs are already taken up by lower than minimum wage foreign workers, so it does not really make any diff in the employment of SCs or foreigners if min wage is implemented. If employment of SCs is being disadvantaged by foreigners than it is the bigger issue of immigration and work permits rather than minimum wage. Having a minimum wage for SCs ensures that SCs who are willing to work does not get underpaid by businesses and companies.

666,3,fzq0tzl,t1_fzpxskk,"I know I am going to get downvoted again but I need to say this.

This is true if the minimum wage is too high like Aus and NZ. A reasonable minimum wage like $1300/month which is pro-rated at about $7.40/hour will not really make much difference to the employment rate. Citing your example of $70 an hour for workers, the employer also needs to think does the F&B business really needs 10 workers to operate?
Does employing too much people lead to decreased productivity? Does reducing the workforce to 9 workers affects the business? Those things will be considered by the restuarant owner when hiring more ppl. With or without the min wage, it does not really affects the labor productivity. Hence, even if the restaurant owner had $70/hour to spent on workers, it will not spent all unless the demend meets the required number of workers. The increase in price to cover the $0.40/hour for each worker is really little and will only slightly decrease the demend of the restuarant. It also does not affect the decisions of restuarant owner hiring abled bodied teen or old auntie because they will always prefer the abled bodied teen to do the job. You might say that the slight increase in pay makes more abled bodied teen much more interested in working in the restuarant due to higher pay, hence replacing some of the elderly workers. This is unfortunately true and it is the downsides of minimum wage, but I think it is a good trade off for a fairer pay. As minimum wages applies to all sector of the economy, elderies working in unwanted job sectors could have a better pay. More importantly, factors like location, popularity and food quality ultimately affects the demend of the restaurant. I know people will be saying that this is a hypothetical thing to say as the restaurant owner in real life might not even consider those things at all when employing someone. 
I recognised that some says that wages that are slightly above the minimum wage ($1400/month) could be suppressed down to the minimum wage. The solution could be solved if the minimum wage could be adjusted frequently to reflect the state of our economy so that people earn enough to survive and thrive. With the politics in Singapore, it is definately possible to adjust the minimum wage frequently. Not in a short notice but years ahead for the announcement like the increase of gst. I should also point out at the current state of our economy, it is not feasible to roll out minimum wage. Maybe in 3-4 years time, I hope that our economy is well-suited and ready to transit into a truly developed country.",t3_i0ea87,30-07-2020

671,3,fzq5t6u,t1_fzq0tzl,"This is why people keep saying that it's not as simple as just implementing minimum wage, and yet people keep on insisting that it is. 

Most of the people complaining about lack of a minimum wage are middle class or lower-middle class people, for whom a minimum wage does nothing for. A minimum wage affects the lowers level of the income bracket. It creates a trend of depressing wages for that which was originally slightly above that minimum wage to becoming minimum wage. A business owner might have given his workers on 6.50/hr 8 hours previously, but with a minimum wage of 7.50, he might give them only 7 hours, which means they earn LESS than before. 

Then there is the part about them being more likely to hire able bodied younger workers than the elderly, which is counter-intuitive to the sentiment of helping the more vulnerable, of which the elderly makes up a bigger proportion. And then, as you said, it will create more efficiency in businesses, which sounds like a good thing, but that creates more unemployment, since a more efficient business needs less manpower. Go back to the F&B example. Right now, a restaurant owner might hire a cleaner/dishwasher for 8 hours, knowing full well that there are hours in the beginning, middle, and near closing of the day where there may be lesser workload. Ok, he is only paying his dishwasher 6.5 per hour, or 52 per day. He still can' afford it. But with a minimum wage of 7.5 per hour, he will have to pay the dishwasher 60 per day. So now he thinks, actually my restaurant from 3pm to 6pm not much dishes to wash. So now he cuts 3 hours from the dishwasher, and the dishwasher earns less. Not only that, the dishwasher now has to incur more cost to go home and back to work during those 3 hours. 

It's not that minimum wage is a bad thing. It's that it isn't a simple solution to a much bigger and wider problem.",t3_i0ea87,30-07-2020

If the minimum wage is not significantly higher than the current wage, then tell me, what is the freaking point? It would just be there in name only, but actually does nothing to change anything. You might as well not have the minimum wage.

Then the rest of your response about the business tells me that you may not really understand what I'm saying.

I'm not talking about there being more people who want to work. While that is true, I'm talking about the current people who already have jobs. If wages are forcibly increased, and the business cannot afford the keep the same number of people, someone is going to be fired. And if you're making a strictly productivity based decision, you are going to fire the old person, because there is no way the 80 year old auntie is as productive as the teen.

Then you also talked about different factors that influence the demand of a restaurant. In economics, they don't mean shit. With all those remaining equal, the demand for any restaurant will definitely fall if you increase the price of the food. Minimum wage isn't going to suddenly make a restaurant more attractive to people to eat there.

I know this is your opinion, but it's a little too idealistic and optimistic, and you're really not considering all the aspects.

As for your example about cutting the dishwasher work hours to accommodate the min wage, the solution is that the part-time dishwasher could choose to become full-time at other restaurant as the min wage applies everywhere so all dishwasher employer must adhere to the rate for both full-time and part-time. The employer could not possibly cut min numbers of hours on min wage for full-time. There will always be demand for full-time dishwasher. How many young able-bodied people are willing to work as a dishwasher full time for $1300/month? Those young people are only taking out some jobs from the part-timers.

679,3,fzr6rgl,t1_fzqlbn5,"There are ALWAYS ways to work around minimum wage. Always. It's just like the deal about productivity. How many people who are working are genuinely working all 8 hours where they are at the office? How efficient are your 70 year old uncles going to be at work? Right now, an employer may be willing to hire 2 uncles at 900 a month to do menial work, because of any combination of pliability and lesser chance of job hopping etc. But if minimum wage goes up to 1300, the employer might choose to hire a younger person at 2500 and fire those 2 uncles. The employer saves 100, these 2 uncles are now unemployed, it's less work for payroll, and it's not as hard hiring a younger person for 2.5k than 1.3k. Or a few employees consolidate their cleaning requirements and share employees, for example. 

Right now, I have employees who only work, in real time,  about 3 hours a day. Let's say there are 2 of them, doing receptionist work, pouring tea for meeting guests etc. I can pay them 1.5k, for example. If for some reason I now have to pay them 2k each, then I might fire 1, keep the other on for 2k, and have her work more. Employers will only be compassionate until their bottom line is affected. 

I am actually in support of a big raise if there is a minimum wage, like 15 dollars an hour. Because that is a significant sum that guarantees lesser use of state welfare and actually forces the employers to earn less. But a minor jump like what is proposed is a small, nominal approach that still leaves plenty of loopholes for employers to exploit, myself included. Yes, the employers may not cut the minimum hours on minimum wage for full time, but they can easily just hire part-time. All it takes is some work-around in the name of efficiency and all will be good again. I know someone who keeps a receptionist around on full time even though he is rarely in the office in the morning and so she has minimal work because there are no guests or meetings in the office. She is paid above minimum wage, but I can guarantee that the moment a minimum wage is implemented he will either sack her or change her to part time. A small increase in minimum wage, which doesn't benefit her, will actually see her income decrease.

840,3,flmq5ai,t3_fprk6u,"nitpick: he was not rearrested in the 1970s; he was not released after his second arrest in 1966 until 1989. 

to be precise - Chia made multiple public speeches in 1966 that could be argued as calling for immediate armed revolution in Malaya. In October he resigned from the newly independent Singapore parliament, denounced it as illegitimate, and called for extraparliamentary struggle. He was then detained on the interior ministry's assertion that he was planning to use the upcoming anti-Vietnam War demonstrations as cover to provoke riots. 

(this was Singapore in the mid-1960s, it was still possible to hold mass protests and stage illegal protests on campuses with only minor penalties. The campuses would not be brought to heel until the mid-1970s)

although the MCP was certainly thoroughly riddled with spies by this point, my guess is that the then interior ministry (today Home Affairs) was not really sure and simply bagged everyone who looked likely to be involved in the Coldstore wave. And then it got caught up in a faintly ridiculous campaign to deport Chia to Malaysia, but Malaysia had no real reason to want him and so the standoff just lasted until 1982 when the govt finally tired of the show.",t3_fprk6u,27-03-2020

2. CTP refused steadfastly to confess and it continued till the very end. While all others did 
3. By mid 1980s, any form of CPM able to carry out anything had long diminished. This, his age and duration of his detention in a prison became untenable optics wise. So Sentosa became an option. Everyone thought it was last a few months to a year. How wrong we were.  
4. The decision to release was not based on a panel or even the ISD. It rested on one man - LKY and he wanted a written confession. Hence the impasse.

847,3,fln11x9,t1_flmq5ai,"To add on, this is an excerpt from LKY's memoirs about Chia:

>One communist cadre held out after more than 20 years in detention, a believer who refused to give up even after communism collapsed worldwide - Chia Thye Poh. He was a determined man with stubborn if misguided convictions. Although a **member of the MCP**, he strenuously denied having any links with or sympathy for communism in spite of **his membership** being confirmed to our Internal Security Department by several MCP members, two of whom he directly reported to.

I think it's significant that LKY is this explicit about Chia being a ""member"" of the MCP. If you're a ""member"" that makes you a bonafide security threat because you're well in a position of control and influence in the MCP hierarchy

Throughout his memoirs LKY is very candid about detaining or alienating people whom he knew were not ""members"" of the MCP. Two paragraphs down for e.g he uses the terms like ""pro-Marxist"",  ""pro-communist"", ""links with the CPM"" etc, but never ""member"" to describe others.

To give a modern day analogy, there are ISIS 'sympathizers' who get detained here from time to time. They are dangerous, yes, but only small fish who've never actually been to Syria or contacted the ISIS leadership. Then you have actual ISIS ""members"" who are obviously a lot more dangerous 

The next paragraph sheds light on why Chia was detained so long:

>He continued to deny his communist links, playing on human rights sentiments of the Western media. **His detention, in spite of Western media pressure, served to discourage other communist cadres from reactivating their cause under cover of exercising their democratic rights.** They were formidable opponents. **We had to be as resolute and unyielding in this contest of wills.**",t3_fprk6u,27-03-2020
848,3,flnfai6,t1_flmq5ai,"According to Chia's own story, he never advocated violence, and he was detained for so long -- with no charges! -- precisely because he steadfastly refused to sign any statement saying he did, even though they promised that he would be released (or at least tried) if he did.

*""The other detainees were released eventually after they each signed a document promising to renounce violence and sever ties with the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM).[9] However, he refused as he felt that signing such a document would imply that he was affiliated with the CPM and, in his own words: ""to renounce violence is to imply you advocated violence before. If I had signed that statement I would not have lived in peace.""[4]""*",t3_fprk6u,27-03-2020

851,3,fln5nkf,t1_fln11x9,"Well, it's tricky. Wind back to the 1960s and the Communist parties sit in actual seats in the parliaments of France and Italy, sometimes even exercising a plurality of seats.

Although the MCP was a proscribed organization, having Marxist sympathies was not itself illegal. The MCP was proscribed because it engaged in illegal methods, not because it had illegal goals. Working with Communists or having once worked with Communists in pro-communist causes was not itself illegal (cough LKY riding the tiger cough). Being a member of a proscribed organization *was* illegal but the penalty was a judicial one, not indefinite detention without trial. 

The argument for detaining someone for decades on end without trial rests on the abstraction of national security. O.K., in 1966 everyone knows the British infamously underestimated the armed threat just a decade prior and that the communists are pretty good at having ten thousand armed men erupt out of the jungle suddenly. So the MCP intel says they are planning to provoke riots, and then they have this guy who is personally hapless and can't even organize a protest (Chia's big resignation stunt that permanently exiled BS from electoral relevance prompted all of thirty people to show up at City Hall), who nonetheless is the MCP's electoral wing, and they detain this guy and all the other guys just in case the riots are intended to propel their electoral shill into power. Fine. Standard communist playbook, fair enough. Chia did not need to be personally up to something to be authentically dangerous, and if he *was* up to something then so much the better.

Ten years later though - ok, fine, the MCP is still mortaring Kuala Lumpur. And the Americans have lost Vietnam and signed Helsinki; the Communist bloc is at its Cold War height and seems to be going from strength to strength, even if locally they're still apparently marginal. O.K.

Twenty years later though? What army was Chia fronting for at that point? Did these cadres really still exist to be reactivated? My sense is that it had become more of bureaucratic inertia, hence Singapore's willingness to be talked into releasing him yet another ten years later (I don't see any reason to doubt Chia's claim that Helmut Kohl lobbied on his behalf; that seems like something Kohl would do. In the National Endowment for Democracy period the West found its assorted allied authoritarians to be suddenly rather embarrassing)",t3_fprk6u,27-03-2020
852,3,flnulwz,t1_flnfai6,"His speeches were public, though... [from the favourite picks of the MHA](http://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/98/1225/letters.html):

>In a speech to 200 delegates of the Labour Party of Malaya in Ipoh on Apr. 24, 1966, Chia said: ""The armed struggle of the Vietnamese will soon break out in Malaya. Therefore, we must make the necessary preparations to revive this sort of struggle."" Malaysia permanently banned Chia from entering there before Singapore acted against him.

>On July 29, 1966, Chia declared at a meeting of the Singapore Commercial House and Factory Employees Union that ""in order to topple the reactionary regimes, we must first combine with the people in Malaya to form a worker-peasant alliance. Today, the whole world is in a turmoil and the situation in Southeast Asia is particularly an encouraging one. Under such favourable circumstances, if we can unfold a struggle by coordinating the struggle experience of the Vietnamese people with our local condition, we firmly believe that all obstacles will be overcome!"" The speech was published in the bulletin of the union.

>On Oct. 8 that year, Chia declared his (Barisan Sosialis) party's rejection of constitutional politics in favor of an extra-parliamentary struggle on the streets. He told local reporters outside Parliament House that he and his comrades were ""now taking our struggle to the streets. It takes various forms - street demonstrations, protest meetings, strikes.""

That Vietnam remark would go on to be a particular favourite - until the 1990s the MHA was still responding to FEER, JBJ in parliament, etc. by quoting that excerpt.

The MHA does not seem to be misrepresenting the context or the content of these quotes; if anything it is too kind by omitting Mr Chia's extensive speeches, in the record of the Singapore Legislative Assembly as Assemblyman for Jurong, arguing that Sabah and Sarawak were currently engaged in armed struggle against colonialism and that Singapore should support their struggle, or if it could not, it should remain neutral like the Afro-Asian nations and certainly not merge with a government that supported the Emergency, that the merger was a phoney merger intended to conscript good Chinese sons to go to war to protect British investments in Sabah and Sarawak, that Malaysia was a neo-colonialist plot.

Chia had *plenty* of time to expand upon his view of what constituted armed struggle (actual men with actual guns engaging in assassinations, bombings, and sieges, not the Woody Guthrie sense of machines that metaphorically kill fascists), the conditions that would justify it (colonialism), and what would be a suitable target (the new governments of Malaysia and Singapore, which he had spent three years denouncing as colonialist for merging in a phoney referendum, and then another year denouncing the newly independent Singapore government for having separated without the consent of Parliament or the people). 

Short of a determined gullibility it seems hard to accept Chia's claim to have not advocated violence, save in the questionable sense that it's not really violence if it is *justified* violence (several former detainees have made this argument before).

Rather, I think the problem for the government case is the opposite. It's really really easy to advocate violence! e.g., consider this quote:

>I agree with the Hon. Gentleman that if any act is done to overthrow a government by force, that act must be suppressed. If we say that we believe in democracy, if we say that the fabric of a democracy is one which allows the free play of ideas, which avoids revolution by violence because revolution by peaceful methods of persuasion is allowed, then, in the name of all the gods that we have in this country, give that free play a chance to work within the constitutional framework. *If you do not, then you will face outright opposition, an armed revolt, and eventually an armed victory.* Then the whole social fabric of this society will collapse.

That would be the Assemblyman for Tanjong Pagar and Leader of the Opposition Mr Lee Kuan Yew, in 1956, who of course does not go on to *say* that the government of Lim Yew Hock is actually disallowing this free play. He is merely *predicting* armed violence, should there be a government so unwise as to pursue such a course. But his party co-founder, the Assemblyman for Bukit Timah Mr Lim Chin Siong, has no such compunctions, has been quite happy to elaborate since his election in 1955, and within a month of that speech would be arrested again for specifically inciting the crowd to literally beat up the police (the Chinese middle school riot incident). By any reasonable standard this entire lot deserves to be clapped in irons, eh?

I'm open tothis interpretation between 1989-1992, ie between the time of the Hat Yai peace treaty and the time of his release. But going from LKY's quote I think it's more likely they saw in Chia's continued detention a symbolic necessity in the 1980s:

>His detention, in spite of Western media pressure, **served to discourage** other communist cadres from reactivating their cause under cover of exercising their democratic rights. They were formidable opponents. **We had to be as resolute and unyielding in this contest of wills**. 

Worth noting is that much intel during the emergency years and after came from human sources, ie informants, detainee statements and surrendering personnel. Keeping Chia locked up would have sent the message that the only way out for MCP cadres was to renounce communism, work with the authorities and provide them with information required to preserve public safety; rather than feigning ignorance and working with foreign 'human rights' groups - some of whom the gov saw as communist-linked and channels for foreign interference",t3_fprk6u,27-03-2020

861,3,flmtn7d,t1_flmrp1v,"Actually (directing this to u/SamBellFromSarang as well) I don't think freedom of speech is the main issue here.

It is that this guy was held without trial for 23 years and then another 9(?) on house arrest. It's an issue about access to justice, the division of powers in Government, and the limits on executive power.

In the same way that all rights have legal limits (such as when the freedom of speech is no longer legally protected if you are preaching a violent uprising), all powers should have legal limits as well (otherwise we would just be north korea where people can be made to disappear).

Chia could well have been fermenting a violent uprising, but is that sufficient justification for holding him without trial for such a long time?

Edit: Even comparing to the detentions for ISIS (and related) sympathizers, the 32 years experienced by Chia is so long that it almost seems like a typo. Nelson Mandela I think was only detained for 26. 

For example -  [https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/full-mhas-statement-three-singaporeans-arrested-under-isa](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/full-mhas-statement-three-singaporeans-arrested-under-isa)

Detention orders are for periods like 2 years

Edit 2: The issue for access to justice is particularly important in this case because one of the reasons Chia ended up detained for so long is that he never confessed to fermenting violence, since in his view he was never doing that. The Government obviously felt differently and so kept detaining him. Chia held out until the Government basically had to just let him go unconditionally.

If Chia had been charged in court, the court would have been able to make a definitive and final finding on whether Chia is indeed guilty of what he is being accused of, making this need for a confession unnecessary. If guilty, he would have been jailed for the necessary term, and then released.",t3_fprk6u,27-03-2020

MHA claims that the State dept was unsubtly angling for local candidates to whip American allied countries into line are believable because we have plenty of explicit evidence that this was a conscious US strategy in Korea and Taiwan and the Philippines. 

Now Chia in the 60s represented the old Chinese socialists: Chinese chauvinists and populist and socialist rolled into one, pinning the PAP between electability and UMNO. 

In 'Marxist Conspiracy' period Singapore we see the PAP feeling pinned by instead by the Chinese populist tendency in the vehicle of the Chiam-period SDP, and the revenge of DS Marshall's anglophile Worker's Party, now commanded by JB Jeyeratnam. Where are the Marxists in this period?  Not in the Chinese villages but instead amongst the liberation theology volunteers... the argument advanced by the MHA at the time was that this was a novel tactical innovation that still represented the old pact via the linchpin of Tan Wah Piow. 

First this argument doesn't seem to be more believable since 1986. Second it still lacks for any actual cadres. The liberation theology tactic was the long march through the institutions, not actual long marches. 

What Chia *was* by the 1980s was an unrepentant Chinese chauvinist still, and indeed we see the Home ministry moving toward articulating ethnic peace as the new basis for the antisedition policies and politics (MRHA, etc.). This would eventually be the hammer dropped on Tang Liang Hong in the mid 1990s. Maybe it would have stuck to Chia, but we'll never know. Regardless - cadres? A little doubtful.",t3_fprk6u,27-03-2020

Actually ISIS in comparison to Communism was nowhere close to Communism. One was using the Koran and twisting the content and using crude and barbaric way such as beheading etc.

Look at Communism. See all the countries that became communists and the outcome. Look at North Korea. It shackled 2  generations in Eastern Europe and they were left behind the World by 50 years.Even the Chinese Communist Party have become high capitalist. Nearly all of them were symbolised by purges, prison camps, imprisonment of intellectuals etc in the thousands and millions. A failed ideology that imprisoned the masses.

868,3,flms6l0,t1_flmrxyc,"> Maybe that guy was a bit OTT but really, you think throwing people aside for decades and trying to silence the people is a good solution?

If they're completely unrepentant and insist they did nothing wrong (claiming to be a ""prisoner of conscience"")? Yes, hold them until they're no longer a threat. 

It's not ""silencing the people"", it's protecting the people from deadly threats. Is censoring pro-ISIS preachers also ""silencing the people""?

>In any case, I think ISIS has proven to be a rather dangerous current organisation, and as long as the subjects are found to be under heavy influence (materials found in their home or whatever), then I think a case can be made.

Perhaps I shouldn't have used the word ""cadre"" and opted instead for something less limiting like ""communist sympathizing subversive"", which is how I would characterize Tan Wah Piow (an *extremely* shady figure) and some other Chinese educated socialist types

You are right that there are differences between the hardcore Chinese socialist types and the mid-1970s middle class parlour communist types

But it's worth pointing out that the CPM tried recruiting both types well into the 1980s

Secondly you have the English educated Juliet Chin types, whom Chin Peng never considered MCP members or even ideologically communist, but nevertheless found their way to the MCP's VCR broadcasting station in China 

From a security and intel standpoint both types had useful information about the MCP and other persons of interest, and could potentially stir up trouble. Had Chia been released easily due to outside influence, the pressure to cease resisting and provide the authorities assistance (had they been caught) would have decreased substantially, which was my original point",t3_fprk6u,27-03-2020

For me, I think his refusal to confess alone suggests that he always subjectively felt that he was innocent. No one who understands that they are guilty would hold out for so long just as a matter of principle. 

The current practice of detention orders has been greatly shaped by legal challenges and bad publicity from things like Coldstore. You are right that it is because of people like Chia that we are thankfully a long way away from simply making someone dissapear for 32 years.",t3_fprk6u,27-03-2020

872,3,flo02ww,t1_flnfs1j,"The answer to the middle class subversives was not detention, though - the Singapore answer to the corruption of the institutions was to vigorously reassert the supremacy of Parliament. e.g., the Singapore Law Society learned that it was *not* entitled to critically comment on pending legislation in its capacity as the Law Society, but instead that its sanctioned role was the *assist* the ruling Government of the day in drafting legislation. The very effective tool of Parliament was to pass *more* legislation, because statutes are the things which make the wheels of bureaucracies turn. 

Detention works on people who want to surprise states with fait accomplis achieved by secretly coordinated force. Detain them first, and they struggle to coordinate - detention under the ISA is *preventative* detention. But merely stirring up dissidence was not held to be a national security threat, even under the maximally authoritarian late period of the LKY premiership - throughout the 1980s LKY was quite happy to let FEER, Amnesty, JBJ, etc. state Chia's case in publications and official records in Singapore. The weapon deployed was to limit sales and revoke copyrights, allowing unlimited circulation otherwise (Newspaper and Printing Presses (Amendment) Act 1986) - the government explicitly maintained the theory that the hostile media was a font for profit-seeking class interest and hence that if the profit was taken away, the lies would cease (note that the govt had the direct power under the Sedition Act to regulate these throughout, it just maintained it *didn't need to*). Throughout it always maintained that it did *not*  fear outside messaging stirring up trouble by messaging alone (the apocalypticism of prospective ethnic dissension a la Maria Hertogh would start only with mid-1990s National Education messaging)

I don't think the case that Spectrum was justified on *internal* security grounds stands in retrospect... it *was* the case that the US was indeed sponsoring colour revolutions amongst its erstwhile Asian allies in the 1980s, and Op Lallang in Malaysia also shows the same anxiety making itself felt in a very different constitutional and social context. [The govt has not been not eager to hold up Spectrum in the way that Coldstore is valourized in the official narratives](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.northwestern.edu/dist/c/1549/files/2019/01/Marxists-in-Singapore-CAS-13ou06z.pdf):

>The official amnesia is perhaps a convenient cover for the fact that there never *was* a conspiracy, Marxist or otherwise. Then prime minister Lee almost admitted as much in confidence at the time when he told the Catholic arch-bishop of Singapore, the late Gregory Yong, that the detainees themselves were of minimal concern to him. He dismissed them as ‚Äúdo-gooders who wanted to help the poor and the dispossessed.‚Äù This possibility was certainly also on the mind of then deputy prime minister Goh Chok Tong, who reported to Parliament in July 1987 that he had seriously doubted the existence of a Marxist conspiracy, but in the end decided to approve Operation Spectrum because he had satisfied himself that the initial group of sixteen detainees were ‚Äúindeed involved in some nefarious activity.‚Äù Significantly, Tharman Shanmugaratnam‚Äôs association with some of the detainees and his subsequent denial of the existence of a conspiracy did not stop his rise through the highest ranks of the Civil Service, his entry into Parliament, nor his ascension to Cabinet. These anomalies suggest strongly that the government was operating from agendas other than national security; yet even allowing for this possibility, many aspects of the pattern of detentions appear arbitrary and whimsical. For example, Tang Lay Lee, a full-time worker for the Young Christian Workers‚Äô Movement (YCW) was detained, but her two colleagues in the YCW office were not. (She facetiously notes  in  a  recently  published  account,  ‚ÄúThey  took [the] cook!‚Äù). Chew Kheng Chuan, a Harvard graduate and a known associate of Tan Wah Piow  in  London,  was  detained,  but  other  associates  of  Tan,  such  as Tharman Shanmugaratnam, were not. For other detainees, ISD‚Äôs motivation was more obvious. Teo Soh Lung reported in interview that after the first month the questions asked of her in interrogation no longer concerned her connections with the supposed Marxist conspirators at all. They focused instead on her connections and activities in the Law Society, to which she had just been elected a councilor by a large majority. The events of 1987 only really make sense if we accept that the particular activities of individuals were almost irrelevant and the government was playing a larger game.

(Michael Barr here is arguing that Lee was seeking to consolidate power in preparation for the handover, but he omits a key event in the Marxist conspiracy brouhaha - the transparent US support in toppling Marcos just a year previous, despite Marcos's insistence that he was the only bulwark against communism. The main audience for the entire drama was, in my view, *the Americans*, who were first pitched with the idea of Marxists still active in Singapore, and when that failed to be plausible to just about anyone including the entire second gen PAP leadership itself, just outright expelling US State Department officials for seeking to ""destabilise Singapore"". Regardless, Barr is right, I think, in arguing that neither the ISD nor Lee nor the 2nd gen leadership really thought that there were any Marxists worth worrying about)",t3_fprk6u,27-03-2020
873,3,fln2edd,t1_flmujd5,"Chia never really disappeared. Him being held in detention was always a cause celebre among leftist inspired opposition figures such as Teo Soh Lung and Tan Wah Piow, and him being in the few prisons in Singapore was never denied.

875,3,flq9w7t,t1_flo02ww,"A couple of points:

1. The American involvement only came to light in 1988 in relation to Francis Seow and his band of lawyers - quite some time after the original 1987 arrests. It's possible that the Americans were involved in the Law Society fracas in 1985/86, but it's more likely that the original 'Marxist conspiracy"" arrests had more to do with communist subversion into religious and civil society groups (through Tan Wah Piow and Vincent Cheng as conduits). I don't think it's a coincidence that the only person arrested in 1987 who was involved with the Law Society was Teo Soh Lung (who had a history with Tan Wah Piow) 
2. Tan Wah Piow's loyalties and motivations are quite shady. There is corroborating evidence that he was well within the MCP's network, and Rajaratnam intimated in parliament that he may also be on the pay roll of a foreign intelligence agency. Could have been CIA given the wider context as you've pointed out but I haven't seen evidence to suggest that (Wah Piow himself interpreted Rajaratnam's comments as an accusation that he was on MI6's pay roll)
3. The 'Marxist conspiracy' arrests probably came about because several OB markers were crossed at once: communist involvement, possible foreign interference and politicization of religious and civil society groups. The ISD annex in the MHRA white paper is perhaps the best indication of what the authorities were really afraid of: the mix of communist subversion, religion and the politicization of the latter at a time when interreligious tensions were at a high
4. Notwithstanding their alarmism, LKY and GCT have come out quite publicly to say that the security threat was 'incipient', ie not with regard to *what was about to happen*, but what *failure to nip the problem in the bud would imply in the longer term.* This would require 'national security' to be viewed in the 'abstract', to use your term, and result in detainees having varying levels of commitment. Some were clean and were released quickly, others somehow had knowledge that Chin Peng was in China and had received visits from Wah Piow.",t3_fprk6u,28-03-2020

> On Tuesday, Nov. 12, Stanley Paruntu, who says he is Sharonia‚Äôs father, took to Facebook to air his grievances about what he believed to be his daughter‚Äôs wrongful arrest after she and her friends spent a night at Hotel W Sentosa.

> Summary of incident

> According to a review by a user named sharoniapatricia on TripAdvisor, Sharonia and her friends had booked a room at Hotel W Sentosa from Nov. 9 ‚Äì 10, 2019 to celebrate her birthday.

> In the morning of Nov. 10, however, Sharonia claimed she and her friends were accused by staffers at the luxury hotel of having a drug party.

> The cause of this entire hullabaloo? Some white powder in an octagonal-shaped bottle that one of the hotel staff found in the room they had checked into when the group had called for assistance regarding a broken glass door in the toilet.

> Advertisement

> Here‚Äôs a picture of the broken door:

> According to Sharonia, Hotel W Sentosa then called the police, and she said she spent some 14 hours locked up at the Police Cantonment Complex, where she claims she and her friends were treated like criminals.

> After police investigations were made, however, the alleged ‚Äúdrugs‚Äù were discovered to not be drugs at all, and instead was something called tawas powder ‚Äî a type of deodorant made from mineral salts.

> Called hotel staff for help when friends stuck in bathroom

> According to Sharonia‚Äôs Instagram stories, two of her friends were stuck inside the hotel room‚Äôs bathroom at around 2am because they could not open the bathroom door.

> Her other friends tried to help to open it, but their efforts ended up breaking the glass.

> After about 30 minutes of fruitless attempts to rescue their friends from the shower, the girls decided to call the hotel staff for help.

> When the hotel staff arrived, one of them saw the bottle of tawas powder and accused Sharonia of bringing drugs into the hotel.

> Sharonia also claimed the hotel staffers never asked her what the powder was before accusing her of bringing drugs into the hotel.

> This is what the tawas powder, which was stored in a bottle, looked like:

> Police treated them like ‚Äúcriminal‚Äùs

> Sharonia also said the police brought her and her friends out of the hotel in handcuffs in what she said was a ‚Äúreally humiliating‚Äù experience.

> The police, according to her, treated them like criminals over the 14 hours they spent in the lockup, allegedly making them sleep on the floor in the cell and giving them food only once:

> To add insult to their injury, Sharonia also claimed in her TripAdvisor review that the hotel charged her S$1,700 for the broken glass bathroom door that she said got stuck and trapped her friends in the shower.

> Police arrested 4 teens, released them at 1:43am

> In a statement shared with Mothership, police confirmed the incident, saying they had arrested four individuals aged between 18 and 19, on the morning of Nov. 10, but released them unconditionally in the wee hours of the next day after they confirmed the white powder was not drugs, nor had any of them tested positive for any drugs.

> Here‚Äôs their statement:

> ‚ÄúOn 10 November 2019 at 9:29am, the Police were alerted to a packet of white powdery substance, suspected to be drugs, found in a room in W Hotel. A man and three women, aged between 18 and 19, who had occupied the room were subsequently arrested for suspected possession and consumption of controlled drugs. They were released unconditionally at 1:43am on 11 November 2019 after preliminary testing on the white powder and their urine samples turned up negative for controlled drugs.‚Äù

> SINGAPORE - Though they are isolated in different rooms, a cross-balcony collaboration was born on Tuesday evening (March 31) between two musicians who are on stay-home notice at Shangri-La‚Äôs Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa.

> Ms Jaz Loh, 22, struck a chord with many, after a video of her playing a stirring rendition of Home on her violin from her hotel room balcony made the rounds on social media on Monday.

> The third-year student who is studying dentistry in England‚Äôs Newcastle University, returned to Singapore on March 26 with the assistance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Singapore Airlines.

> In an interview with The Straits Times, she revealed that she was inspired to perform Home by a fellow stay-home notice resident who has been playing the Chinese flute, or dizi, from his balcony every evening at around 6pm.

> ‚ÄúHe does it every evening around 6pm, and everyone comes out to watch him play and claps for him. We may not be at home, but it brings out the kampung spirit,‚Äù she said.

> Egged on by her Instagram followers who asked her to duet with him, she asked him for his room number on Tuesday evening, called his room and set up a live collaboration on the song The Moon Represents My Heart, by Taiwanese singer Teresa Teng.

> They both played from their balconies at around 6.30pm, drawing applause from fellow stay-home notice residents, who also emerged on their balconies to watch them perform. Ms Loh said they chose the song because ‚Äúit‚Äôs the only song the both of us knew‚Äù.

> She said that the man identified himself as ‚ÄúUncle David‚Äù, a 69-year-old tailor who is working as a tailor in England, but returned to Singapore because of the lockdown triggered by the coronavirus outbreak. He plays the dizi as a hobby, and is self taught.

> ‚ÄúHe told me that he will listen to a song over and over again until he is very familiar with it, then he will play it, she said. Ms Loh has played the violin since she was five years old.

> Earlier on Monday, Shangri-La‚Äôs Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa posted on its Facebook page a two-minute long video of the violinist playing a rendition of Home, which has garnered over 43,000 views, and has been shared by the likes of former foreign minister George Yeo.

> ‚ÄúI feel it‚Äôs a song with a lot of meaning, and one that everyone would recognise and relate to,‚Äù said Ms Loh.

> ‚ÄúEven as Singaporeans abroad, the song brings us a sense of comfort and familiarity while being in a foreign country.‚Äù

> The reaction from the public has been unexpected and overwhelming.

> User Tien Goh was among those who commented, saying: ‚ÄúPersonally, I really like this song very much. Pulls my heartstrings and feel so emotional every time I hear it. Almost teary kind of touched. Together, we will get through this. #SGUnited‚Äù

> Ms Loh said: ‚ÄúI took out my violin to play as a tribute to the workers and to entertain my fellow stay-home notice friends, and also because I‚Äôve been cooped up here for a few days, but I really did not expect it to blow up like that.‚Äù

> 

> Ms Jaz Loh set up a live collaboration on the song The Moon Represents My Heart, by Taiwanese singer Teresa Teng, with a fellow stay-home notice resident who has been playing the Chinese flute. PHOTOS: SCREENGRABS FROM JAZLOHH / INSTAGRAM

> 

> It was also to send the message to Singaporeans ‚Äúthat the least they can do is to stay home‚Äù.

> She added: ‚ÄúAs a young person, I had the perception that we‚Äôre not susceptible to this virus - but this virus doesn‚Äôt care about your race, your age or your gender.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> ‚ÄúWe are asked to do our part and stay home to stop this virus from spreading. It‚Äôs nothing compared to what the front-line workers are doing for us, selflessly putting themselves at risk everyday.‚Äù

> Ms Loh is no stranger to music: An older sibling plays the violin professionally, while two others play the piano and cello recreationally; and she had performed at ChildAid in 2012.

> The concert raises funds for The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund and The Business Times Budding Artists Fund, both of which aid students from low-income families.

He asserts that for Singapore to really accept gays, they just need to show Singaporeans that they are just normal people. Like regular people that you wouldn't even know is gay. Doesn't shout about it. Isn't in your face type etc.

Ask any parent or household heads. How long is this tolerable? The kid is the most visible of us, and is welcome to walk away and establish a movement of its own interest. But it doesn't.

This seems like a rehash of the left-wing 'Overton window theory', which suggests that people need to push the boundaries of discourse far beyond the norm, so they can drag the window of acceptability in their direction.

It's wrong. Excessive pushing in any direction causes *reaction*, and it's often counterproductive for social acceptance. Did JI make the average Singaporean more receptive to setting up an Islamic state? Did Amos Yee make the average Singaporean more receptive to paedophilia? I think not.

So while you may not agree with their style of advocacy, you cannot deny that their effort is what made lgbt acceptance more prevalent today.

You question the validity of applying my worldview yet give definitions to the meanings of rights/inequalities and conservatism based on your worldview. Should we be considering your definitions valid?

Yup, they recognize the third gender, this is documented. Which is a way to marginalize the ""other"". So drag queens walking up and down, does this widen this gap/reinforce the ""other"" or close it?

Dimensionality is irrelevant here. Also, it's so typical to throw around trigger words like homophobia when someone has a conflicting opinion, please rise above it. I'm a gay person, I guarantee you I'm not afraid of the gay lol.

### [Some workers laid off by RWS find new jobs, help available ...](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/some-workers-laid-off-by-rws-find-new-jobs-help-available-for-others)

 When Mr Desmond Toh, 42, was laid off from his restaurant job at Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) in last week's mass retrenchment exercise, he had reason to be worried.  


As the sole breadwinner in a family of seven, with ageing parents and three school-going children, Mr Toh was calculating how long his savings would last.  


But he need not have worried, as he landed a job in the food and beverage (F&B) sector on Monday. He had been offered several job options by e2i, the National Trades Union Congress' (NTUC) Employment and Employability Institute.  


Though he will take a pay cut of around a third of his previous salary, he is thankful to have a job that will help him pay his father's medical bills, among other expenses.  


""I was so happy to receive news of getting a new job so soon after I was retrenched that I broke down over the phone,"" said Mr Toh, who will be a server and pack food for deliveries at a Chinese restaurant.",t3_hrhfbv,24-07-2020

> A highly venomous box jellyfish was spotted in the waters around Sentosa Cove yesterday (July 3), at One Degree 15 Marina.

> A video of the jellyfish was uploaded to Facebook by Marine Stewards, a nonprofit group that promotes marine conservation in Singapore.

> The group also advised members of the public to be careful and to avoid swimming in Sentosa during these two weeks.

> Box jellyfish stings can be fatal to humans

> According to a statement from National Parks Board (NParks) in response to a media query from Mothership, Karenne Tun, the Director of Coastal and Marine at National Biodiversity Centre, highlighted that the agency is aware of the sighting.

> Tun also added that box jellyfish are highly venomous.

> This is due to their deadly toxin, which helps them to instantly kill or stun their prey, like fish or shrimp, thus reducing the damage to their tentacles, according to National Geographic.

> Tun also added that a sting from the box jellyfish is extremely painful and can cause severe hypertension, extreme lower back pain, nausea, cardiac and respiratory arrest.

> It can also be fatal.

> The agency advised that if one is stung by a jellyfish, one should rinse the affected area with seawater or vinegar and not try to remove the tentacles, and seek medical attention immediately.

> Do not handle box jellyfish directly: NParks

> NParks is currently working with relevant stakeholders, such as the academic, boating and recreational communities, as well as agencies whose staff work in and around the coastal waters where the jellyfish was sighted.

> Tun added that the agency is working with academic partners from the National University of Singapore to collect water samples from various coastal areas to conduct DNA analysis, and to help detect the presence of the species in these areas.

> If a member of the public spots a box jellyfish in local waters, they should the NParks helpline at 1800-471-7300, and not handle the jellyfish directly.

> SINGAPORE - One of Sentosa's most iconic structures will be making way for a themed thoroughfare that will link its north and south shores. This is part of long-term plans to reshape the resort island and the adjacent Pulau Brani into a premier leisure and tourism destination.

> Works to demolish the towering 37m-Merlion statue, which sits at the heart of Sentosa, will begin by year-end, when construction on the $90 million Sentosa Sensoryscape project will commence.

> About the size of 5¬Ω football fields, or 30,000 sq m, the new two-tiered thoroughfare will connect the mainland-facing Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) with the beaches in the south, and replace the existing walkway.

> Look-out points, water features and other architectural elements will create a multi-sensory experience for visitors strolling across the island, management Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) said on Friday (Sept 20).

> Its completion by 2022 will mark the first milestone of the blueprint for the two islands, to be rolled out in phases over the next two to three decades.

> Details of the Sentosa-Brani Master Plan, announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day Rally speech last month, were revealed at a media briefing on Sentosa on Friday.

> The two islands will be divided into five zones that will take on a more leisurely character the farther they are from the city, SDC said.

> 

> The Vibrant Cluster zone, which spans the two islands, will have large-scale attractions. Island Heart will feature hotels, conference spaces, dining and retail outlets, while the Waterfront zone on Pulau Brani will house a Discovery Park.

> The Ridgeline zone will connect green spaces from Mount Faber to Mount Imbiah and feature nature and heritage attractions, while Sentosa's beaches will be rejuvenated with a water show, fairgrounds and other attractions in the Beachfront zone.

> 

> Transport connectivity will also be enhanced, and a ""Downtown South"" resort modelled after the labour movement-run Downtown East in Pasir Ris, announced by PM Lee, will likely be built on Pulau Brani.

> The 1.22-sq km Pulau Brani, about a quarter the size of Sentosa, now houses a port terminal, which will move to Tuas by 2027 along with the terminals in Keppel and Tanjong Pagar.

> 

> The two islands are part of the upcoming Greater Southern Waterfront district, a 30km-long coastal stretch to be developed for living, working and playing.

> SDC chief executive Quek Swee Kuan said that rather than having distinct identities, the islands will be linked and integrated in their development, leveraging their island charm and proximity to the city.

> The last day of operations for the Sentosa Merlion will be on Oct 20, and the four eateries and shops will close progressively from Oct 21. When the Merlion was constructed in 1995, visitorship to the island was between four and six million, compared to more than 19 million last year, said Mr Quek.

> There is, thus, a need for a wider thoroughfare, and the Sensoryscape will double the current pedestrian capacity, he said.

> ""We won't relocate the Merlion because of its size, but we are considering how to commemorate it,"" said Mr Quek, who added that a new icon for Sentosa is also being considered.

> While visitorship to the island may be affected by construction works, this will be mitigated by the upcoming Siloso Green lifestyle quarter to open by year-end, as well a new family-themed attraction at Palawan beach, he said.

> Bars, food trucks, live music and waterfront accommodation will feature in the shipping container-themed complex, announced earlier this year. It will span 24,500 sq m of grounds formerly occupied by Underwater World, and aim to boost the island's night offerings.

> 

> SDC is in touch with NTUC Club to identify a suitable location for the Downtown South resort, said Mr Quek.

> He confirmed that the Police Coast Guard headquarters on Pulau Brani will remain, but said other plans for the island are still being developed.

> Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat, who first revealed plans to reshape the two islands in line with plans for the mainland last year, said that the blueprint aims to position Singapore as a leading tourist destination over the coming decades.

> Related Story Second Raffles Hotel set to open in Singapore on Sentosa in 2022

> Related Story Greater Southern Waterfront plans offer opportunities for developers

> The Sentosa Sensoryscape will complement RWS' expansion and subsequent infrastructure enhancements on the two islands, he added.

> Mr Chee told the media that the decision was made to link and develop the two islands together to maximise land use and create scope for more projects and better connectivity.

> ""There are also plans to see how we can, in the short and medium term, enhance the value of...the Southern Islands for eco-tourism, for families to visit and learn about a part of Singapore,"" he said.

> Asked whether there is potential to redevelop other neighbouring islands, he said that organising events and other activities are on the cards for now, while the option is being kept open for the longer term.

> The Singapore Tourism Board said in a statement that the redevelopment of the two islands forms an integral part of Singapore's efforts to rejuvenate its leisure offerings and maintain its appeal.

> While the construction of the Sentosa Sensoryscape entails the closure of the popular Merlion attraction, ""we are confident that both locals and visitors will have more to look forward to on Sentosa in the coming years when the five distinct zones are completed"", it said.

> Visitors can continue to visit the other six Merlion statues located at Merlion Park, Mount Faber, Tourism Court and Ang Mo Kio, STB added.

Control of the funds again is not determined by a simple job title. It is totally irrelevant and a distraction for the public ... What matters is the actual influence he weilds in the church.

> SINGAPORE - Local tourist attraction KidZania Singapore is closing its doors for good after four years, the company announced on Tuesday (June 16).

> In a Facebook post, the company said its theme park in Sentosa will not be reopening upon the lifting of circuit breaker measures and other social restrictions. It did not elaborate on the reasons for its closure in its post.

> ""We've had the pleasure of being here for four years. We've had the joy of entertaining and educating one million kids,"" the company said.

> ""We thank you for joining and helping us build a billion memories. ZanK-U and good-bye,"" it said, using a term it often uses - a play on ""thank you"" and ""KidZania"" - to express its appreciation.

> Singapore enters the second phase of its reopening after the circuit breaker period on Friday, but tourist attractions, both indoor and outdoor, have still not been given the green light to reopen.

> The Straits Times has contacted KidZania for comment.

> The KidZania theme park gives children a taste of different careers such as firefighting, window washing, medicine and journalism through role-playing in an interactive mini-city.

> KidZania Singapore was among a number of tourist attractions that rolled out digital initiatives earlier this year in response to the circuit breaker period. The company launched a social media content series called #KidZaniaAtHome in April, when it celebrated its fourth year of operation.

> The KidZania brand is an international franchise with 29 facilities in 22 countries worldwide according to its website, including locations such as Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Manila.

> Due to the coronavirus outbreak, all its facilities are currently closed to the public except for those in South Korea and Japan.

> The following week saw another nine cases.

> When Mothership visited on Saturday, Feb. 1, there were almost no queues at the stalls in Zone 1 and 2, despite the fact that it was past 7pm.

> Advertisement

> The night market is supposed to open from 5pm to 10:30pm.

> Staff at the stores were working hard to attract sales from anyone walking by.

> There were plenty of empty tables and seats, with a live band performing to a crowd of around 30 people.

> Advertisement

> At 9pm, this was what the place looked like:

> Will continue to operate till last day

> The organisers of the event told Mothership that their footfall and sales are ‚Äúdefinitely affected due to the virus‚Äù, as the number of visitors has dropped compared to previous nights.

> But they remain ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù by the turnout and will continue to operate till the last day on Feb. 9.

> Precautionary measures for vendors and crew are also being taken.

> This includes:

> Taking temperature readings for all vendors and crew before and after the event. Anyone found to be unwell will be sent home.

> Providing masks for all vendors and crew.

> Having the cleaners disinfect the tables and chairs each time they clear the tables.

> Advertisement

> Other parts of Singapore affected as well

> The night market isn‚Äôt the only place affected by the outbreak.

> Tourist spots, shoppings malls, and town area were also quieter, even over the weekend.

> One retailer in town reported a drop of 20 to 30 per cent in earnings, while others declined to reveal the number.

> Chatuchak Market has also just started its run in Singapore, but interest in it remains high, judging by online engagement.

> After the large numbers of Asian openbills that visited at the end of 2019, Singapore has yet another rare wildlife visitor.

> Following the last sighting of a pair of Himalayan Griffon vultures at Bukit Timah, the birdwatchers were alerted to a surprising sighting of them again this week.

> In the early morning of Jan. 9, 2020, a number of Himalayan Griffon vultures have been spotted flying around several places near town.

> S‚Äôpore a pitstop for the vultures

> Himalayan Griffon vultures hail, as evident from their name, from the high altitudes of the Himalayas and mountains of Central Asia.

> They are the second-largest Old World vultures found in the continents of Europe, Asia and Africa ‚Äî their wingspan can reach up to three metres.

> The species is currently classified as ‚Äúnear threatened‚Äù by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

> The Himalayan Griffon vultures have been spotted during the months of December and January in Singapore in some years, according to Singapore Birds Project.

> These birds are here to find food to refuel and rest as they migrate down to the south during winter.

> As a result of the long flight, the vultures usually arrive weak and hungry.

> Advertisement

> Spotted at many places around Singapore

> The large birds were seen congregating in several areas including Outram Hill, Berlayer Creek, near the Singapore General Hospital, Raffles Place, Bukit Panjang and even Sentosa.

> People in Tanjong Pagar: at least 3 Himalayan Vultures (very rare occasional visitors to Singapore) have been spotted in the vicinity of Orchid Hotel. If you see some really big birds flying high up, it's probably them. Also, be prepared for the crowd of photographers. ‚Äî Ivan Kwan (@hai_ren) January 9, 2020

> A birdwatcher told Mothership that he believed there were around 12 vultures spotted together at one point.

> SINGAPORE: One of the maids accusing their employer's wife of abusing them in her multimillion-dollar Sentosa Cove home took the stand on Wednesday (Dec 9) and described her odd working hours as well as the pinches she allegedly received.

> Ms Jenefer Vegafria Arangote, 39, told the court that she slept from 1pm or 2pm and woke up at 5pm or 6pm daily in the three months that she worked for the accused, Tan Lee Hoon, at her Paradise Island home.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Testifying through a Tagalog interpreter, the Filipina said the arrangement was inherited from the maid before her, and said she and the other maids had meals twice a day before sleeping, sometimes skipping the second meal if they were too busy.

> When she joined the household in August 2018, Ms Arangote's chores included cleaning the house, cooking, gardening, as well as massaging Tan daily until the woman fell asleep. She would work through the night, she added.

> She shared these chores with up to three other maids including fellow victim 33-year-old Lizardo Joan Lozares. The remaining two maids ‚Äìknown to Ms Arangote only as Claire and Emily, either left or were sent away during Ms Arangote's time working for the household.

> She said she received her instructions from Tan, who mostly stayed at home, while Tan's husband would leave the house with the children in the mornings.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Tan would usually be sleeping when Ms Arangote went to bed at about 1pm, and would sometimes be awake by the time Ms Arangote woke up at 5pm to do her chores.

> With her consent, Ms Arangote had no days off in the three months that she worked for the household.

> THE ALLEGED INCIDENTS

> The incidents that she recalled occurred sometime in October 2018, with the first one taking place in Tan's bedroom. She was massaging Tan at around 10am or 11am before Tan went to bed.

> Advertisement

> ""When I started massaging her, she was not happy (with) the way I did it to her. Then she got angry with me, that's why she pinched me,"" said Ms Arangote.

> She added that both her and Ms Lozares would take turns massaging Tan until she fell asleep, but Ms Lozares would usually leave the room midway so Ms Arangote was left to massage Tan alone.

> The first time, Tan allegedly pinched Ms Arangote twice on her shoulders. The pinches left ""blue marks"" on Ms Arangote's shoulders, and she took a photo of them.

> During another massage, Tan allegedly pinched the upper right part of Ms Arangote's chest twice. After a few days, Ms Arangote noticed a bruise in the area and took another photo of it, which she showed a friend.

> During a third incident, Ms Arangote was arranging paper lanterns on a tree when she accidentally knocked over a statue, angering Tan. Tan then pinched her on the back of her thigh, said Ms Arangote.

> There was a fourth incident when Tan allegedly pinched the maid on her inner forearm with her fingernails.

> THE INCIDENTS INVOLVING THE OTHER MAID

> Ms Arangote also testified about how Tan allegedly abused her fellow maid Ms Lozares.

> In one incident, after Tan asked Ms Lozares to help her put on her socks, Ms Arangote saw Tan using her fist to knock Ms Lozares on the head.

> Tan was wearing a ring at the time and used it to knock Ms Lozares, said Ms Arangote, who said she was shocked at seeing what happened.

> After this, Ms Lozares helped Tan to put on her shoes but made a mistake and did not put them on properly. Tan got angry and kicked Ms Lozares in her chest, said Ms Arangote.

> In another incident, both maids were preparing to cook when Tan used a thin wooden stick to hit Ms Lozares on her shoulder.

> Ms Arangote said she could not remember why Tan did so. She told her then-boyfriend and another maid about the incidents, and sent them the photos of her bruises or marks.

> Sometime in October 2018, the fourth maid Emily left the house with her bags, and Ms Arangote took it to mean that she was being sent home.

> When Tan returned to the Paradise Island house from the airport, she confiscated all the phones belonging to the maids, said Ms Arangote.

> PHOTOS GONE FROM HER PHONE

> Tan asked Ms Arangote for her phone's password and checked her photo gallery. When she found the photos of the bruises, Tan asked Ms Arangote why she saved those photos.

> ""I told her that I just saved it, and she didn't give our cell phones back,"" said Ms Arangote. She added that she eventually got her phone back from her agent, but the photos had been deleted.

> On the morning of Oct 17, 2018, the maid that Ms Arangote told about the bruises informed the Ministry of Manpower about what happened, and the police arrived at the house.

> They took the maids to the hospital and returned to the house a few days later to seize the closed-circuit television server, but nothing was found on it as there was no hard disk.

> Tan is contesting eight charges of voluntarily causing hurt to Ms Arangote and Ms Lozares.

> According to charge sheets, she is accused of pinching Ms Arangote's right bicep, stomach, chest, arm and thigh in September 2018. She is accused of hitting Ms Lozares' head with her hand and kicking her chest in October 2018, as well as hitting her torso with a stick on another occasion that year.

> The trial continues, with Tan defended by lawyers Sunil Sudheesan and Diana Ngiam. They are set to cross-examine Ms Arangote subsequently.

> If convicted of voluntarily causing hurt, Tan could be jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$5,000, or both, for each charge. As the offences are against maids, she could be given up to one-and-a-half times the original punishment if found guilty.

> The resort island has seen a 20 per cent to 50 per cent drop in visitors since the outbreak last month, the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) said yesterday in response to The New Paper's queries.

> A spokesman for SDC, which is part of the Tourism Recovery Action Taskforce, said the free admission from March 14 to 22 will give its guests ""a much-needed getaway"".

> ""After all, a healthy dose of sunshine and fresh air could be a boost to one's health,"" he added.

> The spokesman assured visitors that with enhanced precautionary measures in place, its diverse leisure offerings remain open.

> With the Singapore Tourism Board expecting visitor arrivals to fall by 25 per cent to 30 per cent, businesses that rely on tourists are looking at ways to attract more locals to make up for the shortfall.

> Royal Plaza on Scotts, for instance, is running a staycation promotion for Singapore residents, which includes free upgrades to premier rooms, all-day refreshments and free breakfast for two.

> Its restaurant Carousel is bringing back its popular lobster and crab promotion on Feb 23 after a six-month break.

> The hotel's general manager, Mr Patrick Fiat, said: ""It is inevitable the tourism industry is having a lull period with the coronavirus outbreak. We are hoping revenue loss will not exceed 30 per cent for the year.""

> Mr Kieran Twomey, group chief operating officer of Millennium Hotels and Resorts, which operates Copthorne King's Hotel and M Hotel, among others, told TNP that it is business as usual despite the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert raised from yellow to orange last Friday.

> He said: ""We have pushed a regional Valentine's Day package that offers a 30 per cent discount off suite rooms. Several initiatives such as staycation packages are also in progress.""

> Ms Margaret Heng, executive director of the Singapore Hotel Association, which is also part of the task force, said it would be collaborating with partners and government agencies to aid Singapore's recovery.

> She said: ""Business is affected, but we can use this downtime to upskill our employees to prepare them for the upturn.""

> This includes working directly with hotels to train and upgrade workers to prepare the industry for better hospitality and service standards, she added.

> ""The hotel industry is impacted... (but) we must not lose sight of the recovery process."" - ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY CHEOW SUE-ANN

1814,3,efv08t1,t3_anp5ax,"Given the context, I'd opt for the express pass! Less time in the queues (given that it's Friday, and a Friday of a week of holidays)! I've never had an express pass, but waiting out 2hours for certain rides can really be tiring. Since it's your fiance's birthday, you can use the time to walk around and catch more of the shows (like Lights Camera Action, 4D shrek, and the Donkey show). 

Also if you're taking the wet jurassic park ride, bring an extra set of clothes or a poncho! 

Added tip: if you stay til late, the queues for mummy are almost always only a 2-5min long queue. That means endless consecutive rides! I was a season pass holder and my friend and I would always take the mummy so many times. ",t3_anp5ax,06-02-2019

Pick up some drinks and food if u know the line is long. Chat and eat as u move along the queue. 

My frens usually play mobile games while waiting in queue. 

If u must sit together and do not wish to wait, then the express pass is useful. It is her special day. Splurge! ",t3_anp5ax,06-02-2019
1816,3,efv9jdn,t3_anp5ax,"Hello hello. State my credentials first (cough). I hv the express annual pass. I visit frequently to enjoy and capture the seasonal events with my trusty camera. (Advertise my Instagram here cough cough). Look for crazypoorasean in instagram. 

Anyways Fridays are quite crowded so it's best to get the express pass if you want to enjoy all the attractions on the same day. 

Unlesssss... you're willing to wait till the last 1-2 hours of the park's opening period. That's when the queues thin out for the more adult-ey rides. Meanwhile you can enjoy the shows, meet and greets and performances. 

When you enter, look towards the member lounge on the left and there'll be this little trolley right beside a pillar with lotsa brochures. There's this little slip of paper that contains the park's entire schedule for the day. 

Right now there's chinese new year celebrations so there's a show by sesame street gang at the new york area and also the park wide dragon dance parade. 

Andddddd the park is extending it's closing to 10pm on the peak days. That's F.S.S. and public holidays. There'll be jamming sessions, fireworks and a night parade. 

Since you're going to be settling down here for a while, I'll rather you convert your tickets to the season or annual pass. You can visit anytime without blackout dates which is pretty nice. And you get a small discount for the retail and F&B stores. And some other benefits.

1817,3,efv5s5a,t3_anp5ax,"If you want the more aggressive way... 10am it opens. Start first with the Transformer ride it tends to break down in the afternoon from over heating from there take the mummy ride for some early thrills but if your stomach can‚Äôt handle it go for the kids ride. My personal favourite is Elmo‚Äôs Spaghetti Space chase. Or you go to Madagascar and ride there most of which are easy going rides. If you need a break from walking go for the Shrek Show since it‚Äôll be next area. Puss in boots would probably be about an hour queue by then so if you‚Äôd like you could skip it. 

Usually at this time I have an early lunch. Eating outside the park is much more affordable but if you are game the pizza shop near Elmo is something to try. After this I‚Äôll either go for the When I grow up Show or Water world shows to digest my food and not puke it out. Water world would probably be more exciting since it involves water and explosions. Elmo has aircon though you pick depending on the mood. 

From there usually I get bored and leave but if you‚Äôd like queue for the Jurassic ride which would be about 2 hours? Of course you can skip this the other rides at the Jurassic world are insignificant and long queues so Id skip those.

At around 5pm usually the Q for the biggest attraction rollercoaster would have died down to either 15-45mins depending on your luck. I believe the park is introducing night time play so I can‚Äôt predict how the Qs would go. Id end the day at the stores if you want to spend money on items. Really depends. After this you can take pictures or ride something again its really up to you. You can walk back to Vivo for dinner since you ate early or eat smth expensive I like the pancake shop all because you can draw your own designs. 

Don‚Äôt ask how I know all this information. Also you don‚Äôt have to follow everything here except for the first bit. Of course if you want a much more relaxing day exploring the park is great and stuff nooks and crannies for pictures. This ‚Äúguide‚Äù also missed out on quite a bit of what the park has so try to make your own memories on this.

I'd 100% say its worth it if you can afford it, queuing there looked like hell. Friday on CNY week I'd expect would be busy also. 

Side note, the ""cyclon"" BG roller-coaster is the better of the 2 BG roller coaters so if you don't get Express and don't want to queue for both, I'd recommend cyclon. Also with those coasters make sure you put all your stuff, glasses/wallets everything in the lockers by the ride before you get on.

> SINGAPORE: Resorts World Sentosa (RWS), one of Singapore's biggest private-sector employers, said on Wednesday (Jul 15) it was laying off staff as part of cost-cutting measures in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

> In response to queries from CNA, the resort, which is owned by Genting Singapore, declined to say how many staff members were affected. It has around 12,500 employees.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> RWS said in a statement it had already ""reviewed all costs"", eliminated non-essential spending and cut the salaries of management by up to 30 per cent, but had to make the ""difficult decision"" to retrench employees.

> ""The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought about challenging economic times globally, generating a devastating impact on the tourism industry,"" RWS said.

> ""In this latest round of review, we have made the difficult decision to implement a one-off workforce rationalisation. This decision was made after a thorough process of careful deliberation and consultation,"" it said, adding that the move will help it prepare for the recovery of Singapore's tourism sector.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The resort, one of Singapore's top tourist attractions, encompasses a hotel, a casino and the Universal Studios theme park among other attractions.

> 

> The company had only announced last year it would invest about S$4.5 billion to expand its tourist attractions in the country.

> 

> ""We fully understand the difficulty and anxiety this means to impacted team members and their families. RWS takes a long-term view of our manpower needs, including the consideration to maintain a strong Singaporean core,"" it said in the statement.

> RWS said it is working with various agencies to help retrenched employees find new jobs.

> They include the Attractions, Resorts and Entertainment Union (AREU), Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), Public Service Division, Workforce Singapore and SkillsFuture Singapore.

> ""At least two to three job opportunities have been successfully identified and shortlisted for every affected local team member,"" said RWS.

> In a joint statement, the AREU and e2i said they were notified in advance of the layoffs.

> ""COVID-19 pandemic‚Äôs impact on the tourism industry is unprecedented, immediate and immense,"" the statement said.

> ""We held many discussions with RWS on minimising wage and labour-related cuts. RWS had fulfilled its obligations and workers also assisted along the way; including helping out at Community Care Facilities. Retrenchment is therefore taken as a last resort.""

> The union also said it has worked with the resort to extend ""fair compensation terms, employment-related and placement assistance"" to affected employees.

> Singapore's economy sank into a technical recession in the second quarter, shrinking a record 41.2 per cent from the previous quarter, data showed on Tuesday, putting it on track for its deepest slump ever.

> 

> The tourism industry, which contributes about 4 per cent to Singapore's economy, has been one of the worst affected sectors due to travel restrictions and a ""circuit breaker"" period that lasted more than two months to curb the spread of COVID-19.

1861,3,g6akm8x,t3_iy3sb4,"Another poor move, unfortunately.

The move makes sense because it allows people to do not queue up at the beach trying to get a spot, since the spots will be pre-assigned, but the number of people allowed is too small.  
I would not be surprised if all the spot - every single week - would be filled out entirely within the first available ""reservation day"".

This was a move that should have been implemented way earlier until probably now.  
And these days, with community cases pretty much at 1 and unlinked below 1, we should be look at easing some of the restrictions: for example we could allow more people in all those spots that are low risks: outdoor activities, outdoor recreational areas, etc...  
Instead we are implementing (with some critical delay) a measure that just adds yet another restriction to the multiple we are currently facing + complications.  
Yet another little hit at businesses, moreover. 

One question, if someone is healthy, below 40 and let's say, single, what he/she is supposed to do to have some sort of ""healthy life""?  
\- Nightlife is shuttered;  
\- Bars cannot operate unless they have a food license.  
Food establishment cannot serve alcohol after 10.30, and since at 10.30 nobody is supposed to drink alcohol anymore within the premise, they kinda stop serving around 9.45/10PM the latest.  
\- Majority of restaurants who are not food courts or hotpot/chuan chuan/shaokao tend to close by the same time too, so around 10/10.30 everyone has to leave.  
\- If she/he is into group sports, you are still pretty much not allowed to do them.  
\- If she/he want to go to a Mall, there is an extensive crowd control, and each and every shop implements one too. So you queue after queue, with no social distancing in place.  
\- If she/he is into travel, there is not a single reciprocal green line agreement in place, which would be vital for a place like Singapore since it is a City-State.  
\- If she/he wants to go back home for a period of time, she/he is not allowed to, because if you do so you have to comply to a very strict process before coming back, your company will also be responsible for you abroad, etc... (Technical one could leave and then come back whenever the borders are going to re-open, but not many are willing).

And all of this with:  
\- avg 1 new case in the community a day for the past 14 days  
\- avg < 1 new unlinked cases in the community  
\- Less than 40 people in hospital  
\- 0 people in ICU

And instead of talking about easing some of the restrictions, we are looking at new ways to implement some, we are looking at a token, we are looking at a ton of other stuff whose efficacy is extremely doubtful and that seems won't be implement to reopen anything per se.",t3_iy3sb4,23-09-2020
1862,3,g6al8ja,t1_g6akm8x,"I won't consider nightlife and drinking ""healthy life"" for everyone. Malls (e.g. Vivo, Funan, Bugis) were pretty ok too even during weekends. Sports in small groups is also allowed under the current rules.

Anyway, HK has a big second wave that hit after weeks of zero local transmissions. They managed to bring it under control after their toughest restrictions ever, and help from China that boosted their testing capacity to more than 100k a day (Singapore's testing capacity is no where near).  After bringing it under control, nightlife and drinking are still considered risky venues with strict restrictions.

Opening too fast would risk the need for a second round of circuit breaker which will not do anyone any good.",t3_iy3sb4,23-09-2020
1863,3,g6atgf5,t1_g6akm8x,"Completely agree. Why are these restrictions coming in now? The move should be in the opposite direction. The point of circuit breaker, and the phased reopening was to reduce cases and learn to live with the virus. Instead we‚Äôre reducing cases but failing to learn to live with it at all. All of these rules have downsides - curbing individual freedom, damaging the economy, damaging mental health. Singapore is paralysed by fear, and the repercussions of the Govt‚Äôs inability to reopen in a measured way is going to be felt for a Long time.

The second wave of Hong Kong is actually a non-news that people enjoy telling in here to probably justify some of the restrictions.
If you look at the numbers, in less than 7 weeks they managed to bring the cases back to below 10 a day, and already started easing some of the restrictions.
And even during their worse, they were generally speaking reporting less cases than here.

In here we have strict restrictions since April and the situation is still as it is, and this is not healthy for tons of people, and definitely tons of businesses.",t3_iy3sb4,23-09-2020

I have never been so worried about my future in Singapore as I have been in the last 3-4 months - and not because I am fearing retrenchment, but because I might end up having to leave if things will continue following a certain direction.

A lot of pragmatism, everything was forecasted and planned well, and things were simply working.

Now I see in the local Government the same thing I see when I work with many people.
When things go by the book, I am working with top class professional, but as soon as something unexpected happens, it's the end of it. No real clue about what to do and a lot of random stuff going on.

I still have friends in Hong Kong and I have to admit I am extremely surprised at how their local government has done a fantastic job in managing the pandemic, they had pretty much no hard lockdown, if not the last couple of months (with still less restrictions than here) and they managed to cope their 2nd/3rd wave in a super effective and fast manner.
They are re-opening some entertainment venues in a matter of few weeks, etc...
Funny to say their ""waves"" have always had laughable low numbers - and if we want to call them waves, how long is the Singapore first wave, since we never went below 10 cases a day in the last 6 months?

What I think is lacking here is a transparent communication of what are they trying to do.
- Do you want to have a Phase 2 for how long?
Of course you cannot give people the right date since the situation is unprecedented and fluid, but how long will the phase 2 be in your estimation? 6 months? 12 months? What is the goal?
- How long the phase 3 will be? Until the vaccine?
- How long until people can start to have some degree of travelling? 2 years? 
Etc...

If more details would be given out, everyone would probably live with more peace of mind.
And all the people with a choice, will be able to make the choice of either leaving or staying.

Snitching aka cancel culture exists everywhere. Let's not kid ourselves.

Also, does living involve wantonly breaking a rule despite the consequences made abundantly clear? There's a reason the vast majority of foreigners haven't gotten deported.

Florida.

>wearing a mask when sat alone in the middle of an empty park

You do understand that repeatedly touching your face to take a mask on/off, thereby turning your mask into a fomite, negates the whole point of wearing a mask in the first place, right?

>no music in bars

This was already explained by our authorities. If the music is loud enough, people tend to speak more loudly or even shout, thereby spreading more droplets.

>being allowed to cram onto the MRT

Public transport is essential for workers who cannot do so from home. They've also enforced social distancing as much as possible.

>but having to sit spaced out on rides at universal studios.

How is going to a theme park an essential service that precludes social distancing?

>I don‚Äôt consider obeying all rules without questioning, understanding or being given the ability to protest them as living.

Yeah, because meeting up with friends for drinks during a *lockdown* totally qualifies, right?

> SINGAPORE - All the rooms at the Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa Hotel where Singapore's first Wuhan virus confirmed case and his travelling companions stayed in have been sanitised and sealed off.

> Four staff members that came into contact with the infected patient have also been told to stay at home since Wednesday (Jan 22), the hotel said on Thursday night.

> Shangri-La Group's executive vice-president of operations in South-east Asia and Australasia Josef Dolp said that all four are currently well and have so far not displayed any symptoms of the virus.

> He said: ""The rooms which the guests had stayed in were thoroughly disinfected and sanitised after the guests had checked out.

> ""We will continue to remain vigilant and will assist the health authorities with their investigations and contact tracing efforts.""

> The infected guest, a 66-year-old Wuhan native, had checked into the hotel with his family on Monday, Mr Dolp said.

> He had reported sick on Wednesday, before getting warded.

> The hotel then got in touch with its staff to trace who had come into contact with the man, said Mr Dolp.

> Mr Dolp added that the hotel has increased its cleaning and sanitising frequency in the last few weeks since news of the Wuhan virus broke. Temperature checks are also in place for staff and guests.

> When The Straits Times went to the hotel on Thursday evening, many of its staff were using surgical masks. Masks were also made available to guests.

> Several guests, including Mr Kelvin Yu, were requesting for a hotel switch at the reception desk.

> They told ST that the hotel has agreed to help them find rooms at another hotel for the evening.

> One of the guests, a retired business owner from Shanghai, who only wanted to be known as Madam Zhang, 64, said she does not dare enter any of the rooms in the hotel.

1962,3,er405t6,t3_c0eg1p,"> # Property prices at Sentosa Cove drop to record low, a unit just sold at 50% loss

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî As prices of Sentosa Cove properties drop to a record low, a condominium unit at a development called Seascape on the resort island was recently sold at a 50 per cent loss.

> The three-bedroom unit was sold for S$3.1 million on May 23, which is S$3.2 million below its original purchase price of S$6.27 million in 2010, based on information from the Urban Redevelopment Authority‚Äôs transaction database, Realis.

> Data from property consultancy Cushman & Wakefield showed that resale prices for Sentosa Cove properties have dropped to S$1,367 psf presently ‚Äî a record low since luxury homes were first launched on the island in November 2004.

> In the month of May, the other two non-landed transactions on Sentosa also posted losses, though marginal.

> At a condominium project called The Coast at Sentosa Cove, a 4,779sqf unit was sold for S$6.52 million, a 3.8 per cent drop from the original purchase price of S$6.78 million in 2006.

> Another condominium unit at The Berth by the Cove, with an area of 1,302sqf, was sold at S$1.78 million, a 1.1 per cent decline from the purchase price of S$1.8 million in 2007.

> HEAVILY MARKETED TO FOREIGNERS

> Analysts agreed that the cooling measures that came into effect in July last year played a role in bringing down its prices, with Mr Wong Xian Yang, senior research manager at Cushman & Wakefield, noting that the measures ‚Äúhave not been kind‚Äù on Sentosa Cove properties.

> As a luxury enclave heavily marketed to foreigners, the costs of buying a property at Sentosa Cove have gone up considerably for them.

> The Additional Buyer‚Äôs Stamp Duty (ABSD) was increased to 20 per cent for foreigners buying any residential property.

> However, analysts agreed that the latest cooling measures are just one part of the story.

> Based on Cushman & Wakefield‚Äôs data, prices of non-landed properties in Sentosa Cove have generally been declining since 2011, way before last year‚Äôs cooling measures.

> When private property prices across the country turned after a four-year decline and jumped 9.1 per cent from 2017 to 2018, Sentosa‚Äôs non-landed properties only managed to go up slightly around the same period ‚Äî 0.8 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018.

> Mr Desmond Sim, head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia in property firm CBRE, said that the increase in overall prices then was on the back of new property launches and increasing land acquisition costs.

> Given that there were no new launches in Sentosa then, it ‚Äúdid not benefit from the upswing‚Äù, Mr Sim said.

> DROP IN SPECULATIVE BUYERS ¬†

> Rising interest rates and earlier cooling measures, as well as stricter credit controls in China are among some of the other factors that have led to the continuing decline of home prices at Sentosa Cove, property analysts said.

> Mr Wong from Cushman & Wakefield said that there were earlier rounds of cooling measures, such as the introduction and tightening of the Sellers‚Äô Stamp Duty. Home-owners who sell their property within three years after purchase would be liable to pay Seller's Stamp Duty. The faster they sell it after the date of purchase, the higher the tax.

> This effectively curbed speculative buying, he said.

> And speculators used to form a big proportion of buyers at Sentosa Cove, as pointed out by Mr Alan Cheong, senior director of research at real estate service provider Savills.

> Another earlier cooling measure was the introduction of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio in 2013, which required banks to ensure that the monthly debt obligations of home-buyers cannot exceed 60 per cent of their household monthly income. Dr Lee Nai Jia, senior director at property consultancy Knight Frank, said that this caused prices to drop.

> NO MORE ‚ÄòEASY MONEY‚Äô

> Besides speculators, the other group of buyers included those ‚Äúwho had too much money to spend‚Äù, Mr Cheong said.

> Liquidity was easily available during the period before the 2008 global financial crisis. Mr Cheong referred to this as ‚Äúthe go-go years‚Äù, due to looser credit controls in China and debt-fuelled asset purchases in the Western economies.

> Many initial foreign buyers of Sentosa Cove properties were from China. However, tighter credit controls in China that came when Mr Xi Jinping took over as president in 2013, as well as reforms to the global banking systems after the financial crisis, meant all that ‚Äúeasy money‚Äù has largely disappeared.

> Many earlier buyers have had to sell their Sentosa Cove units as they ran into liquidity issues, Mr Cheong noted.

> The profile of buyers now has¬†also changed. ‚ÄúPeople are now talking about wealth preservation, not talking about having money to throw. It‚Äôs not the days of the Lamborghini‚Ä¶ you have to make your money work,‚Äù he said.

> Mr Sim said that globally, the rising interest rate environment has also compounded the issue, with investors finding it increasingly difficult to generate good returns.

> RENEWED INTEREST, MAYBE

> Analysts believe that it will be a matter of time before the real estate market at Sentosa Cove will turn.

> With prices now similar to some new condominium projects on the mainland targeted at the mass market, buyers may realise that properties at Sentosa Cove could hold value over the long term.

> Dr Lee from Knight Frank said that he is already seeing more interest in Sentosa Cove properties in the past month.

> He added that Singapore is probably still seen as a safe haven compared with other luxury property markets in the region, and that may attract a group of investors interested in wealth preservation. ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY NG JUN SEN

> Revamp for Sentosa Boardwalk

> A $70 million walkway to Sentosa that was once among the most popular waterfront hangouts for Singaporeans may be given a new lease of life by an upcoming development of Resorts World Sentosa (RWS).

> The Straits Times understands that the 700m-long boardwalk, now managed by Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC), will be redeveloped as part of the integrated resort‚Äôs expansion plans.

> Sentosa Boardwalk, which connects VivoCity to the RWS waterfront, was billed as a ‚Äúdestination in itself‚Äù when it was opened in 2011.

> Themed gardens showcasing tropical landscapes and six shops and eateries dotted the timber bridge, while canopy-covered travellators ferried visitors to a 6mhigh lookout point.

> But today, just two businesses ‚Äì The Wine Company and Bones ‚Äôn Barrels ‚Äì and clusters of vending machines remain on the boardwalk.

> The Wine Company, which opened its doors almost immediately after the boardwalk‚Äôs opening, will move out by January next year, co-owner Belinda Lim told The Straits Times.

> In 2017, the eatery and wine bar signed a new three-year lease, with the option to renew for another three years. Expecting to stay on for at least six more years, the firm spent $50,000 on renovating the outlet, said Ms Lim.

> But in April, she was told by island management SDC that she would not be able to exercise her option when the lease expires in January.

> ‚ÄúI was looking forward to the place being spruced up. But they told me I couldn‚Äôt stay because the boardwalk had to be handed to RWS,‚Äù she said.

> In an e-mail to Ms Lim that was seen by The Straits Times, SDC said it anticipated that lease renewal would not be viable ‚Äúdue to the upcoming redevelopment plans on the boardwalk‚Äù.

> SDC offered other possible locations on the resort island which she turned down.

> Business on the boardwalk has declined over the years, in part owing to its design, she said, as restaurants on the bridge are not visible to those who take the travellator.

> Bones ‚Äôn Barrels and Royal Vending, which operates the vending machines on the boardwalk, declined to comment.

> SDC said, in response to queries, that it is still in discussion with RWS on the implementation details of the integrated resort‚Äôs expansion.

> The boardwalk remains accessible to pedestrians, and businesses on the boardwalk are operating as normal, it added.

> RWS said that it was unable to give details.

> Plans for its $4.5 billion expansion, announced in April, include a new waterfront lifestyle complex that will house two new hotels, shops and eateries.

> It will also operate an unmanned shuttle along Sentosa Boardwalk to ferry visitors to the new complex.

> The waterfront stretch facing VivoCity now houses several empty buildings and tiered seating for its soon-to-be-replaced nightly show, The Crane Dance.

> Meanwhile, broader changes for the resort island are expected as transformation plans announced last year start to take shape.

> Earlier this month, SDC put up a tender for the proposed demolition of Tiger Sky Tower and ancillary buildings. The 110m-tall tower, which closed in December last year after 15 years, is located at Imbiah Lookout on Sentosa.

> Dr Michael Chiam, senior tourism lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, said that RWS‚Äô waterfront is underutilised. Extending RWS‚Äô reach to Sentosa Boardwalk would be a winwin scenario, he added.

> The new tram would reduce the load of the Sentosa Express monorail, which runs between VivoCity, RWS and beach stations, and provide an exclusive entry to the resort, Dr Chiam said.

> ‚ÄúSpaces on the boardwalk could be used for entertainment in line with RWS‚Äô offerings for a more seamless experience,‚Äù he said.

> ST PHOTOS: NG SOR LUAN The 700m-long Sentosa Boardwalk, which connects VivoCity to the Resorts World Sentosa waterfront, was billed as a ‚Äúdestination in itself‚Äù when it was opened in 2011, but only two businesses remain on it today. The Straits Times understands that the boardwalk will be redeveloped as part of the integrated resort‚Äôs expansion plans.

> SINGAPORE - A second Raffles Hotel is set to open in Singapore in 2022, more than a century after the original national monument in Beach Road opened its doors in 1887.

> Hotel operator Accor Group, in partnership with property developer Royal Group, announced on Tuesday (June 25) that the new Raffles Sentosa Resort & Spa Singapore will be built on Sentosa.

> The proposed all-villa resort will feature 61 villas, each with its own private swimming pool, set in a 1,000,000 sq ft property, the equivalent of approximately 17 football fields. Royal Group, which owns SO Sofitel Singapore and Sofitel Singapore Sentosa Resort & Spa, will build the new Raffles resort on land adjacent to the existing Sofitel on Sentosa.

> Managing director of Royal Group Peter Wilding, said during a press conference on Tuesday that the hotel will be a new interpretation of the iconic Raffles brand.

> ""We did a lot of work in studying luxury resorts in Singapore and in Sentosa and we found that there is demand from tourists that want to stay in exclusive luxury resorts with that aspect of privacy and security. If we didn't launch this new villa hotel, we would be losing those tourists to other parts of Asia.""

> He added that the resort will be the first villa-only hotel in Singapore.

> Design studio Yabu Pushelberg, founded by Canadian designer George Yabu and Glenn Pushelberg, designed the resort, including the landscaping, lighting and interiors. The firm previously worked on luxury hotels including the Four Seasons Toronto and New York and St Regis Mexico City.

> Villas will range in size from about 2,800 sq ft for the one-bedroom villas to 4,800 sq ft for the four-bedroom villa. Each villa with have its own courtyard and pool with a suspended daybed.

> Prices of the villas have not yet been confirmed but in comparison, a suite at the Raffles Hotel costs between $1,300 and $12,000 per night.

> Hotel facilities will include a bar, restaurants, a fitness centre, a celebrations room and two meeting rooms.

> Meanwhile, Raffles Hotel closed in December 2017 for its most extensive restoration and renovation project since 1989. It will reopen in August this year with new suite categories, an upgraded ballroom as well as new and refreshed restaurants and bars.

> The hotel, which was designated a national monument in 1987, has been managed by AccorHotels since 2015 after the Paris-based chain signed a US$2.9 billion deal to buy out FRHI Holdings, which operates a string of hotels around the world under the Raffles, Fairmont and Swissotel brands.
