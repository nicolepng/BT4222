On the [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentosa) page, a section is dedicated to him, saying:

>The former political prisoner and Nobel prize nominee Chia Thye Poh spent three-and-a-half years in internal exile on Sentosa after he was freed from 23 years in jail in 1989.

Interesting. Further research on [Infopedia] (https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2013-05-22_180815.html) yielded this:

>Chia was then released from prison in May 1989, but was restricted to residence on the island of Sentosa along with restrictions on public speech and political activity. The following year, the restrictions were amended to allow him to visit the mainland of Singapore between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. daily, and to allow him employment with the permission of the Internal Security Department. He later worked as a freelance translator for the Sentosa Development Corporation.

Of course, your question is — what did he do???

Politics, of course. He was arrested several times in the 60's and 70's for going against PAP's grain, such as protesting against the US invasion of Vietnam. Eventually, they accused him of communist sentiments and locked him away under the all-powerful ISA act. 

He spent 23 years tucked away, before bizarrely being sent to Sentosa for 9 years. It was described that he was made to live in a small guardhouse and had to pay rent. Because he had no money, he was offered a job on Sentosa, but didn't want to be ""muzzled"" by the government. And so he went ""freelance"".

Interestingly, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015. He is apparently still alive... somewhere in Singapore?

Huh.

I know it depends on the time of year but would it be wise to do so this Friday? My concern is the price! It’s upwards of $120 for two people. I want her to have a great time and if it means spending 30+ minutes less in a queue, I’m willing to do it. 

If anyone has has experience in this, and whether it’s a good idea, please share 💕
