Inspired by [this recent post about the dolphin mascot of marine parade](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bxucvg/til_that_marine_parade_has_a_mascot_called_marley/?st=JWOVJ2I1&sh=220a4192), and how every prefecture in japan has their own mascot (see [here](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/japanese/japanese-culture-mascots/) and [their wiki page here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuru-chara)), with the most famous one being kumamon for the Kumamoto prefecture. 

If all towns were to have their own mascots, what would they be, how would u design them? And why? (Not limited to GRC towns/electoral map, feel free to use any systems (mrt station names, cdc, town centers etc) to design your mascot!

Serious answers most welcomed but joke answers tolerated, because why not, it’s a Sunday!

Edit: if any digital artists want to try drawing these out, feel free!"
