4,15,gpwrknm,t3_lyr6if,"as a person from central europe (slovakia) i love singapore precisely for threads such as these. it reveals several structural problems in less advanced countries:

-in my country this is common as hell. wrecks on sidewalks, blocking the pedestrians. nothing the authorities can do. not even trace the owner. 

-even if you'd trace him, the law can't order him to do anything about it. without a court order (years in a case like this) the wreck stays.
- but who would even put him to court? the courts are clogged and slow. everyone just cares for themselves. ""a wreck on a sidewalk? not my problem!""
- my country is obsessed with cars. since it was hard owning a car during socialism, now that they're cheaper, everyone has one. in a country of 5mil, most of our sidewalks are impassable (not just wrecks, it's actually LEGAL to park on the sidewalk).
- you can bribe any emission and tech check-up, so every car passes the tests. you can have a coal steam engine and still show up as a 100% emission compliant.
- i understand singapore can recognize a wreck like this as an ""eyesore"". i appreciate this mechanism, as it is common sense. in my country, there is no common sense. you can't do anything about things, that are obviously illegal. and if you'd propose such a mechanism, they would say: ""who are you to declare what is an eyesore and what's not? are you some kind of fascist autocrat? we love our little shithole country, let it stay like this.""

Had a big pot, ladled the soup over the noodles and gave you a spoon. Not much ingredients, portions small. People had to order 2 bowls. And both of them had zero manners and service. Gravy more importantly is light. 

Aunty (328) sets up Laksa stall next door at 47. ( I know that this runs contrary to various articles). Bigger bowl, more ingredients, richer gravy etc. Business picks up, becomes popular and she gets kicked out and 47 landlord asks his wife to run a Laksa stall. 49 kicks out Janggut and offers the 328 Aunty Jangguts place. Shortly after she too gets kicked out and she moves to 51. 47 and 49 stalls are now run by the wives of the respective landlords. Status is now 3 Laksa stalls and Jannggut boys go missing for 2 years. 

Circa 2000, Janngut boys return and take up 57. Someone else jumps in at 53. So we now have 5 stalls. 

Violet Onn turns up and declares 47 the worse and stall closes. 328 at 51 still the best, very popular. 

328 expands, start selling other things and new outlets open and quality drops. They close down these outlets and work on 51 and quality picks up again. Gets Michelin and start next  round of outlet expansion and quality again drops again.

>#Get set for wonton mee wars as two Eng's open near each other in Tanjong Katong

>^(PHOTO: The new Eng's Char Siew Wantan Mee, still unopened, just down the road from Eng's Wantan Noodle at 287 Tanjong Katong Road.)

>A business feud that got too hot to handle is allegedly the reason that not one, but two, eateries bearing the famed Eng wonton noodle name will soon face off in Tanjong Katong.

>In one corner, at 287 Katong Road, is Eng's Wantan Noodle, which recently reopened to brisk business after renovations. This is the original eatery that founder Ng Ba Eng presided over in 2012 when he relocated from his hawker stall in Dunman Food Centre in 2012.

>But fans of Eng's, and its ferocious chilli sauce, would not be faulted for thinking they are seeing double when Eng's Char Siew Wantan Mee opens just doors away at 248/250 Tanjong Katong Road in May.

>The upstart newcomer will be helmed by none other than Mr Ng's children themselves - Mr Desmond Ng, 48, who took over the business after his father died in 2013, and his two sisters.

>Mr Ng told The Straits Times on Wednesday (April 18) he had split from his father's business partner at Eng's Wantan Noodles, Ms Pauline New 50, who was assisted by her husband, Mr Jason Sim, 52.

>""My hope is just to carry on my dad's legacy,"" said Mr Ng, who said the day-to-day operations of the new place would be handled by his sisters.

>In a further twist, the original eatery at 287 Tanjong Katong has a new owner as well.

>Ms New has also decided to exit the business, and a new lease has been signed by the chief executive of soup chain Lao Huo Tang, Mr Thomas Hong.

>Mr Ng Ba Eng could not have foreseen how it would grow to a business taking in up to $1.5 million a year when he began selling noodles from a pushcart in Duku Road more than 50 years ago. The cart turned into a stall at the Dunman Food Centre in the 1970s, where Eng's noodles became a household name with its springy noodles tossed in an addictive chilli sauce.

>Mr Ng was named a Singapore Hawker Master by The Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao in 2011.

>The stall relocated to larger premises at 287 Tanjong Katong Road in 2012 but Mr Ng died a year later, at the age of 71. Many loyal customers turned up at his wake to pay their respects.

>Interviews with Mr Ng and Mr Sim revealed disagreements over money, customer service and the fate of the eatery when the lease ran out in March.

>Mr Sim claimed there were numerous complaints about service after Mr Desmond Ng took over the eatery's management.

>Mr Ng, on the other hand, said he had a loyal base, and had decided to open a new restaurant only because his partners had had a new lease signed without him.

>When contacted, Mr Hong said he took over the lease because he had been told that the restaurant was permanently shutting down.

>""I'm a wonton mee lover, and I am friends with the staff at Eng's, so I thought it would be a waste if it closed down and did not continue,"" said Mr Hong, 45. ""I was quite surprised when I learnt that they were opening up again.""

>While the protagonists wage war over a lucrative brand, loyal customers say two Eng's are better than one.

>Mr Marcus Tan, 21, eats at 287 Tanjong Katong at least once a month.

>He said the food was mostly the same since the opening last Monday. ""The flavours are all still there, especially its signature chilli which has not lost its kick,"" said Mr Tan, who is waiting to go to university.

>Asked what he thought of the new establishment just down the road, he said: ""I think it partially removes the exclusivity of the Eng brand, now that there is more than one of them. However, I feel that it will also keep both restaurants on their toes to ensure their standards remain high. ""

>Mr Leonard Hu, 45, said he would patronise both places.

>The manager, who has eaten weekly at 287 Tanjong Katong for four years, added: ""Competition is good. The queue is very long at times and I may not get a seat or the food may be sold out. Now I've a higher chance of getting my weekly fix. ""

>In fact, that chance can only grow, as expansion is firmly on Mr Hong's mind. He said he plans to open about 20 Eng's outlets across the country in the next three years.

>He added: ""And after we have opened enough places in Singapore, we will move on to other countries.""",t3_8dapjp,19-04-2018

Personal anecdote. I lived in the katong area for 15 years. I grew up eating Eng's wanton mee when it was at dunman food center because its near walking distance to home. My mom used to take extra lard (ba pok) and chilli which they gave freely and generously. 

Anyway, one day I noticed a new 'cook'. Its the son and ho boy he was rude. Super rude. I've heard stories of hawkers who are too successful and proud so they can shout at customers but this was the first case of me experiencing it for myself. Gone was the friendly uncle and heres some guy barking orders with a angry face. No more free flow lard, chilli is reduced to 1 packet small per. He would scold people say very slow, can move faster not.

> SINGAPORE: A man believed to be involved in a shooting incident at Tanjong Katong Road 38 years ago has been arrested, the Singapore Police Force said in a news release on Sunday (Mar 25).  

> Seow Lam Seng, now 63, was arrested in Penang on Thursday with the help of the Royal Malaysia Police. He was extradited to Singapore on Saturday. 

> He has been on the run since the incident on Oct 3, 1980. 

> On that day, two police officers conducted a check on Seow and his friend Lee Ah Fatt at about 2.30pm along Tanjong Katong Road as they were behaving suspiciously. 

> Seow was allegedly found in possession of a pistol.

> Lee then allegedly drew a pistol from his back trouser pocket and pointed it at the officers, resulting in one of them drawing his service revolver to shoot at him.

> Although he was shot, Lee continued to struggle with the two police officers. During the commotion, Seow managed to flee from the scene, police added. 

> Lee succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. 

> Seow will be charged in court on Monday for unlawful possession of a firearm. He faces life imprisonment if convicted. 

> Commenting on the case, Criminal Investigation Department Director Tan Chye Hee said: “I would like to express my utmost gratitude to the Royal Malaysia Police for their efforts to locate and arrest the suspect, for this serious case involving the use of firearms in Singapore.

> ""The arrest and extradition of the suspect after 38 years on the run would not be possible without the strong support from the Royal Malaysia Police, our closest crime-fighting partner. The Singapore Police Force will continue to work closely with other law enforcement agencies to track down criminals, and ensure that they are brought to justice and face the full brunt of the law.""

Breakfast options: very limited. Mostly eggs and toast. Most businesses don't open early. Walk to marine parade hawker center 5 mins away for more choices.

Traffic: since katong is essentially one long narrow road, jams may occur during weekends. 

Night time: very quiet. Not like it used to be. Since all the shady bars are closed down. Hungry at night? Better order in fast food. All businesses closed.

Weekday lunch: office crowds. Eat early or late. Can't find any seats anywhere around 1pm. But they'll leave pretty quickly. Eat around 12 if u don't wanna wait. Pricey joints are always empty tho.

Cabs rides: hailing one on the street is impossible. Go queue at the nearby malls. 112 katong or katong shopping centre. There's uber of course.

Katong is quaint, low key and relaxed. Quite the opposite of Holland V. Many expat families live around here. You'll probably see them only on a weekend tho.

I'm looking at reviews of the Katong area and it seems there's also a wide range of food and diff price points there? Though it's along a mile long stretch of East Coast Road whereas Holland is more compact? Am I right about this?",t3_7qu5xk,16-01-2018

281,15,dss1tl6,t1_dss0kt2,"Hello and welcome to Singapore in advance :) 

1. Location 
  Is traveling time important to you?  If so then my honest opinion, from what I gather about your wants, would be Holland village. It's ease of access will be easier compared to Katong. In HV, you have buses and trains. In Katong, you have to bus first before going to any nearby trains. HV will also allow you to meet people more easily and travel out for days when you don't need to work. 

2. Beach 
  If the beach is an important factor, you should then stay at Katong. However, there are people who have cycled from wherever they live, be it the north, south and west of SG to East Coast Park (ECP). I have friends who live in the east area (Katong included) and the ease of bike riding to ECP is easy and makes for good get aways. However, they do wish that they are close to central SG so as to cut travel as they have to take two forms of transport to get anywhere, mainly bus first then the train or bus and another bus. 

3. Food Prices 
  It will be cheaper in Katong especially if you stay near the Roxy square mall area as there are many cheaper food options and the wet market in the main area called Marine Parade where there is also a mall called Parkway Parade. HV will be slightly costlier because of its location advantages as well as it naturally attracting people due to the food choices as well as the location itself ( where families come to visit nearby areas and then dropping in HV to eat ) However, I don't think the prices will differ much because the Marine Parade area host many people and prices are bound to be slightly higher due to convenience which might equate to the same prices in HV. 

4. Things to do 
  The location of HV allows your to travel easily with the nearby connections of the Circle Line (Mass Rapid Transport or MRT for short) and this allows you to move around SG fairly easily. In addition the bus connections you have in that area is slightly better than that of Katong. (But I may be wrong and will be open to other advice/feedback) 
I you like to bike or run, both locations are fair as you can get to places with the bike. For running it depends if you are okay with 'city life' running where it's asphalt running or you want to head to the ECP to run. 

5. Personal Opinion 
Although it seems like I'm leaning more towards HV, I have tried to give my best opinions on Katong. I stay in the central part of SG (Toa Payoh) and have gone to school in the Katong area for 5 years. I did not particularly like having to be in the East because I really enjoyed the convenience being in the central region. But I think that the East really does have its perks too because in Katong you will have 2 malls nearby and the beach and ease of access into the city due to the expressway should you need an Uber or taxi. 
That said, it really depends on what you would like. :) ",t3_7qu5xk,16-01-2018
282,15,dss3m22,t1_dss0kt2,"Yep sounds about right but I haven’t been to katong area recently. There are some new malls there (112) so my impression of the area is that it’s an older, quieter neighbourhood.",t3_7qu5xk,16-01-2018
283,15,dssdl05,t1_dss8el5,"In that case, the katong location might be more favourable to you. Will be lovely to do your training runs along east coast park while watching the planes land. There are also plenty of bars along east coast road and other amenities.

Only downside is no access to the MRT (subway). But the buses are pretty good here, will probably take you about 30 mins to get to business district.

It basically a series of running trails that connect the entire island. If you want you can follow the PCN network from one end of the island to the other

285,15,dss85qo,t1_dss1tl6,"Hey! Thanks so much for the answer!! Really appreciate it. 

Regarding travel time, it's not too much of a big deal for me since I don't have to travel to client office every day. And I'll only have maybe a night or two free every week to go to town or whatever since I'm still working at night (US time working hours). 

I'll be taking the subway or public buses as much as possible. 

Seems like Katong has better everything aside from public transportation access which Holland Villagio has.

The man (Janggut) who invented and popularized Katong laksa passed away and none of his kids took over. Nancy, who had no ties to them, took over the space and started the 328 chain. However there are 2 surviving family members making the orignal Laksa (Janggut's brother used to make and sell laksa together with Janggut).
