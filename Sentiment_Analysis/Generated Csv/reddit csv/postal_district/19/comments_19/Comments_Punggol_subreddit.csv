Just treat them with respect like all wild animals, as another redditor said; just pick them up gently on a piece of paper and take them outside, there‚Äôs nothing in your house for them and they‚Äôve just made a mistake by coming in.

Has there been any planting or landscaping near your place? I noticed a ton of millipedes when the workers did the flower beds in my neighbourhood, I think they might come in the mulch. Lots of dead plant material for millipede munchies!
If that‚Äôs the case, then their numbers will die down as the mulch and plant material is consumed.",t3_l09qts,19-01-2021

222,19,gjt8ajy,t3_l09qts,"This one's the Rusty Millipede (*Trigoniulus corallinus*). Believed to be native to tropical parts of Southeast Asia, although its original distribution is difficult to determine, and it has now [spread throughout the tropics](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/123010-Trigoniulus-corallinus). The other very common species of millipede in Singapore is the black and yellow [*Anoplodesmus saussurii*](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/app/uploads/2017/06/2012nis141-149.pdf), believed to be an introduced species from the Indian subcontinent. There are [other millipede species present in Singapore's urban areas](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/-/media/cuge/pdf/rtn-11-2012---urban-millipedes-in-singapore.pdf), although I think these two are the most common ones that we will encounter in our neighbourhoods.

I usually pick them up and move them to the nearest grass patch. Millipedes tend to defend themselves with the help of foul-smelling, even toxic secretions, but as long as you don't have any open wounds on your hand, and don't lick your hand or rub your eyes immediately after handling them, you should be fine. *Anoplodesmus saussurii* and its close relatives, generally known as the flat-backed millipedes, incorporate hydrogen cyanide in their secretions, which probably also explains their coloration, since the black and yellow could be a warning to potential predators.

Various species of invertebrates that have adapted to environments created by human activities, and which thrive in our gardens and even in our homes are often called 'tramp' species; these have inadvertently followed humans as we travelled across the world and transported goods everywhere. We have several species of urban millipedes that are thought to have come from other parts of Asia, but thrive in the conditions found in our urban green spaces. This is in contrast to many of the [native species of millipedes](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/app/uploads/2017/04/myriapods_checklist_singapore.pdf), which are mostly restricted to forests. These millipedes are easily transported to new areas while hidden in soil, plants, and mulch; with an abundance of food, some species can end up becoming extremely abundant. *Anoplodesmus saussurii* is one such example; it forms aggregations that are often active even during the day, which explains why it is so conspicuous in areas with recent landscaping work.

The good thing is that millipedes usually don't attack live, healthy plants. In fact, they function much like earthworms, helping to break down decaying plant matter, and their burrowing also helps reduce soil compaction and improves aeration. Last year, I set aside a compost bin and added a bunch of Rusty Millipedes I picked up downstairs, and it's amazing to see how quickly they can process vegetable scraps, fruit peels, and shredded cardboard.

It's unusual to have millipedes crawling up 7 storeys though; it's possible that one of your neighbours has millipedes breeding in their potted plants, and they're crawling out and ending up in your home.",t3_l09qts,19-01-2021

For example, humans reach terminal velocity after 450 meters of falling. That means that they will have the same speed if they fall from 450m than if they fall from 5km.

As a rule of thumb, the smaller you are, the less terminal velocity you have. As bugs are very light for their volume, air drag makes their terminal velocity very low, and thus they won't die no matter from how high you throw them.

To give you an idea of how big an animal can be before they will die from a fall, mice are borderline small enough to survive a fall from a plane. Bugs are definitely safe.

> A mother and daughter got a shock of their lives when they found a male stranger in their Punggol HDB flat and that he had showered in their bathroom.

> According to Lianhe Wanbao, the incident happened in the evening of March 28.

> The 27-year-old mother decided to bring her daughter out for dinner.

> She turned off the electrical sockets in the house and left the house unlocked at around 7.15pm.

> While the mother and daughter were gone, a 51-year-old man walked past their flat and realised that there was no one at home.

> He then hatched a plan to break into the house.

> He first moved the CCTV camera outside the woman's house and then opened the front door.

> Upon entering the house, the man discovered another CCTV camera inside.

> He knocked the camera, causing it to fall onto a bed.

> He then rushed into the bathroom to take a shower, snatching the woman's daughter's pants to use as a towel.

> At about 10.30pm, the woman and her daughter returned home.

> Upon entering the house, the woman realised that the bathroom lights were switched on.

> When she moved closer to the bathroom, she saw the man drying his head with her daughter's pants.

> Taken aback, she shouted, ""Who are you?""

> The surprised man shouted, ""No!"" while dashing out of the house.

> The woman then called the police.

> Although the CCTV cameras and laptop in her house had been moved, nothing valuable was stolen.

> The police later verified the man's identity and arrested him on April 1.

> The man, who was also found to be an ex-convict, was charged in court on May 27 and sentenced to five months' jail.

> H/T: Lianhe Wanbao

> Neighbour from hell

> In the past two years, six households on the same floor in a HDB block in Punggol have moved out

> Over the past two years, one Housing Board block in Punggol has seen heavy market activity. Six households on the same floor moved out ‚Äì because of one woman.

> Dubbed the neighbour from hell, she is accused of splashing oil at others‚Äô doors, playing loud music and stomping on the floor. One neighbour even claimed she had left a bloody pig‚Äôs ear on a shoe rack.

> Multiple police reports have been made. Feeling helpless when told by the authorities that what she did was not an arrestable offence, six families to date have sold their flats, with the latest one moving out last November. New families who moved in said they have also made reports to the authorities.

> The second resident in the Punggol Central HDB block to move out due to the neighbour did so with her husband and t wo-year-old daughter in February last year, five years after moving into the BuildTo-Order block, which has a mix of two-, three- and four-room flats.

> She told The Sunday Times that it was ‚Äúso stressful‚Äù that she even appealed to HDB to let her sell her flat before completing the five-year minimum occupation period. Her appeal was rejected.

> ‚ÄúI simply couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I would go home after work to find some kind of liquid splashed on my door. One day it was used cooking oil, another day it was porridge. The worst was when I saw a pig‚Äôs ear on my shoe rack,‚Äù she said.

> ‚ÄúIt was my first flat and I felt very ‚Äòsuay‚Äô (unlucky). I sold my flat to another family. I felt sorry for them but everyone wants to escape.‚Äù

> The neighbour in question is a 51-year-old housewife. In 2013, the divorcee and her son, who is waiting to enter university, moved into their two-room flat.

> Interviews with her former and current neighbours indicate that the trouble began the year after.

> One neighbour showed a folder of at least 17 police reports filed, as well as complaints to HDB, the constituency‚Äôs MP Ng Chee Meng and the residents‚Äô committee.

> In an e-mail response, an RC spokesman said: ‚ÄúRC volunteers are aware of the situation and have spoken to the relevant parties on multiple occasions. The RC will continue to work closely with the agencies to help resolve the differences.‚Äù

> A police spokesman said: ‚ÄúAs the reports were for non-arrestable offences such as intentional harassment, noise pollution and mischief, the housewife‚Äôs neighbours were advised to lodge a magistrate‚Äôs complaint. All involved parties were also advised to keep the peace.‚Äù

> A magistrate‚Äôs complaint is filed when one wishes to start a private prosecution against someone he believes has committed a criminal offence against him. The spokesman added that one has been lodged.

> The neighbour who filed the complaint, after an earlier attempt at mediation failed, lives in the flat above the woman‚Äôs. He claims she intimidated him with ‚Äúa large stone‚Äù when she confronted him about noise from his flat last month.

> ‚ÄúThe noise was from a construction site nearby. Even neighbours locking and unlocking their grille gates is noise to her,‚Äù said the neighbour who declined to be named.

> The accusations were disputed by the housewife who said he had provoked her by dropping metal balls on his floor which she could hear.

> ‚ÄúSo I took a pebble and went up to bounce it outside his unit‚Äôs corridor as I was very angry. It disturbed my sleep and it was not the first time. I also called the police,‚Äù she said.

> Speaking to The Sunday Times at her home for three hours on Thursday evening, the housewife was calm and articulate as she addressed her neighbours‚Äô accusations.

> ‚ÄúIf ex-owners said they sold their flats because of me, I tell you, I am not that great. I, one person, cannot do all this. I have footage of their nuisance acts and they are no bunch of sweet peas,‚Äù she said and accused her neighbours of ganging up against her.

> One ex-neighbour who wanted to be known only as Mr Lee, said the neighbours had held a few meetings as they experienced the same issues with the housewife.

> The disputes started with the previous owner of the unit facing hers, recalled the housewife. She said the couple threw cigarette ashes into the gap between her wooden door and grille gate. So she installed three closed-circuit television cameras outside her flat.

> In the past five years, the woman added, she has filed multiple complaints with different agencies, including the National Environment Agency, about her neighbours.

> When told that her neighbours had complained of loud music and banging doors coming from her flat, the housewife said she has to sleep with her radio on each day ‚Äúto drown out the noise‚Äù from upstairs. ‚ÄúMy conscience is clear.‚Äù

> Last year, the couple opposite the housewife sold their home to a 34-year-old single mother. On her first day home, she found police at her door. The administrative assistant who declined to be named, said: ‚ÄúShe had called the police to complain that my cousin was making noise and smoking at the corridor. A month later, she poured cooking oil outside my flat on three occasions.‚Äù

> Mr Zheng and his wife, who live diagonally opposite the housewife, also share similar feelings. Just two months after moving in last August, Mr Zheng got into an altercation with her.

> Mr Zheng, who installed a CCTV camera outside his flat, said: ‚ÄúShe will stare into my camera and make faces. Of course we feel uncomfortable watching all this. But there‚Äôs nothing we can do. We can only wait for five years and sell our flat.‚Äù

My mum bought several speakers and positioned them so that her music would blast directly into the neighbour‚Äôs kitchen and bedroom.

Then one day, the neighbour started to attack our side of the common chute. She‚Äôd take a bamboo pole and kept banging the door of our chute, and sometimes she‚Äôd ‚Äúbomb‚Äù out chute with oil or curry or some other gross things. My parents retaliated in a similar way.

Seriously? Isn't the sound of metal balls dropping on the floor the sound of pipe contractions at night? I really pity the neighbours for getting ""punished"" for things they did not do.

Non-arrestable =/= not a crime. All the stuff she does is against the law (mischief under penal code, noise pollution under miscellaneous offences act, intentional harassment under POHA). They're just non-arrestable offences, i.e. police have no power to arrest her. That doesn't mean she cannot face punishment, if the neighbours file a magistrate's complaint, take this woman to court and depending on the severity of her offences, she is still liable for fines and jail time. 

Sounds unfair to some people, I know, but the police can only work within the confines of the law. And the law is written as such to prevent people from being arrested for the less significant offences (imagine if police can arrest someone based on harassment, all it would take is for someone to accuse you of staring at him/her and you'll be in handcuffs). Sure, this woman is testing the limits of the law, but the law is the law and the onus is still on the neighbours to pursue the matter in court.

> So how come ah long draw stuff on the wall and doors of the hdb block can be punished by law?

Totally different crime, totally different act of the statutes. Though again, all the stuff this woman does can be punished by law, it just requires the neighbours to pursue the matter in court.

> And if so,if the neighbours bike chain the door grills of the neighbour from hell,it should also be allowed by the authorities right? I believe we need to cage uncontrollable feral animals in lah. 

That would be wrongful confinement, so the neighbours would be arrested instead. 

I am not siding with this woman in any way, she sounds like a nightmare to live near to, and I have massive sympathies for the neighbours who had to put up with it. But at the same time, it's not fair to blame the authorities every time something similar occurs. Yes, the thought of some crime being non-arrestable sounds counter-intuitive to some people, but such is the way our statutes are written. There are avenues for measures to be taken against this lady, but in this case the neighbours felt that moving was a better option than having to drag this matter to court.

Despite the misbehaviour going on for five years, it looks like a Magistrate's Complaint was only filed last month after she turned up with ""a large stone"".

My take is this: I wonder how many neighbours have involved lawyers, because I don't see that mentioned. If the MP lived in that flat, they would probably be able to afford lawyers, described [here] (https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/what-if-my-neighbour-creates-a-disturbance-or-deliberately-tries-to-annoy-me/) and [here](https://learn.asialawnetwork.com/2017/10/30/neighbour-disputes-what-can-you-do/). CNA has also reported that:

> [In serious situations, the Tribunal can grant a more draconian Exclusion Order, which can force the respondent neighbour to move out of their home.](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/commentary-bad-neighbour-call-police-let-s-rethink-this-9859850)

Now that stance would cause many people to think that you're trying to say that the race is relevant in the discussion here, when it is not.

755,19,emfh82d,t3_bk98di,"I still think that along the NEL, an LRT line around Hougang would've been practical. 

Hougang (for a very long time) had only 1 feeder bus to cover practically a large portion of the neighborhood, and as a result, it made the journey to Hougang MRT for residents in the western part of Hougang become very long, as they had to travel through basically everywhere else first.

As a result, people who live in Hougang West end up traveling to Serangoon/Buangkok or even Ang Mo Kio because the journey is alot shorter, but when CTE gets clogged up, it affects these residents because their entire road is jammed up, even if they aren't heading towards CTE, and buses all pile up at that one spot. 

They can't even deploy extra buses to that area because they will all get stuck too. No point trying to get a Grab/Taxi because it'll be stuck as well. This is one scenario where buses simply aren't effective. An LRT system would've greatly benefitted here",t3_bk98di,03-05-2019

If it was conceptualised a bit later, that park could have easily been called Seng Kang Park too (but purely just my speculation and musing).

To add on a bit of interesting history, Hougang was called ÂêéÊ∏Ø (loosely translated to ""back port"") because it was located at the back of Sungei Serangoon. This is also why there's a ""Kangkar"" mall, ""Kangkar"" loosely translated to ""foot of the port"". Serangoon road was named also because of Sungei Serangoon. Today Sungei Serangoon more or less became Pasir Ris and Punggol, while what remained was diverted so that Punggol Road could connect to Serangoon Road in a straight-ish line.

> SINGAPORE - A 34-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday (Dec 31) for using social media app Telegram to incite Personal Mobility Device (PMD) users to attack park users at Punggol Park.

> The police said they received a report on Monday that a Telegram user had posted in Telegram chat groups calling for PMD users to gather at Punggol Park at 9pm that day to ""cause injury to anyone they see"".

> Officers from the Ang Mo Kio Police Division identified the suspect and arrested him on Tuesday at 10am.

> Two mobile phones were seized from the suspect.

> It is unclear why the man incited PMD users to turn violent.

> Those convicted of making an electronic record containing an incitement to violence can be jailed up to five years, fined or both.

Studies have shown that it takes a wastepaper basket fire only five minutes  to fully engulf a room. So imagine a room's dustbin catching fire. Usually the fire spreads to the curtains, and then to the mattress and then it engulfs the entire room.

> Just three days after a TikTok video by @justmillenial posted about the befuddling sheltered walkway at Edgedale Plains in Punggol, workers were spotted fixing it.

> The sheltered walkway, which the user called ""the dumbest design ever"", ended right at the back of a bus stop, giving pedestrians no sheltered access to the bus stop.

> The TikTok user posted an update today showing workers busying themselves around the bus stop.

> At the part where the sheltered walkway was supposed to be connected to the bus stop (it currently ends at the back of the bus stop, blocked by a metal railing), at least five construction workers and plenty of neon orange cones can be seen in the video.

> Here's the video:

> The user added:

> ""Shelter update: 2 days after posting the video there were people inspecting the bus stop. 3 days later they are fixing it!""

> ""Thanks for blowing this up TikTok, and thanks to everyone hard at work this weekend,"" added the user.

> A comment on the TikTok user's initial post also had a screenshot of an email shared by user Clement Kang.

> The email was apparently sent by a Senior Estate Executive of the Punggol Branch, presumably from HDB, stating that the covered walkway would be extended.

> This is Kang's post:

1352,19,getud9p,t3_k7bejk,"I walked past the bus stop this afternoon. There was auntie complaining to the person in charge how they could have designed and built something that don't make sense. 

I heard the person say the walkway and underpass is by HDB and the bus-stop is by LTA.  Somehow no co-ordination. 

So now one glass panel is removed and steps were built for the raised area. There is a yellow sticker to warn of low head area.  

They put metal sheets to prevent rain water from sipping from the roof. However, there is a small gap not covered. When it rains, I think there will be a rain curtain. 

Let's wait for the next downpour to see the results.",t3_k7bejk,06-12-2020
1353,19,geu8z7o,t3_k7bejk,"this is about boundaries. the sheltered wallway was probably under the HDB‚Äôs budget, and when it was designed, the bus stop was still not there. it was just understood to be a future bus stop location, so they designed a covered walkway that would connect directly to the designated bus stop area. 

since there is a level drop between the sheltered walkway zone and the bus stop zone, BCA required a barrier of sorts to prevent people from crossing and tripping over, so barrier was installed. bus stop has yet to be constructed. 

finally LTA is the agency in charge of constructing bus stops. they have a standard design for bus stops, awarded the contract to a contractor, and contractor just do exactly as LTA wants, bec LTA is also very particular when it comes to deviation from their standard design. 

once everything was built, LTA realizes ‚Äúshit, there‚Äôs no access to the bus stop‚Äù 
and builds the steps outside of the bus stop and the sheltered walkway.

i say LTA bec footpath is their jurisdiction, its outside the property line of the HDB, so only they are allowed to do works there. they build the steps outside of the sheltered walkway and bus stop because it was probably done by a separate contractor for a separate contract, and of course no contractor wants to do works that modify/change the works of another contractor, because that would mean they have to take over liabilities for the works. 

so they do the steps outside of the bus stop, open to sky, to step on as few toes as possible. 

and now you add a NEW contractor, tasked to connect a sheltered linkway (also LTA standard design) from the existing HDB sheltered walkway to the steps, then link it back to the bus stop.

1373,19,gerjbl3,t1_gera6pa,"I guess my rather selfish answer would be - I don‚Äôt, and it ultimately may not matter.

You are absolutely right that the authorities likely get a lot of feedback through the proper channels, but simply don‚Äôt have the time and resources to see to all of them. At least not right away. It‚Äôs the same thing with software bugs and fixes. Some issues take years to be resolved, not because the developer doesn‚Äôt care, but because they have numerous tasks that need seeing to and something of lower priority has to give way. 

The question then comes when you have a matter that‚Äôs deemed as urgent to you, even if it is not absolutely critical in the larger scheme of things. Knowing that the government probably also has a ton of other stuff to see to, what do you do to get your request to stand out from the rest and garner enough attention that the government has no choice but to put everything else down and attend to your needs right away? 

You blow it up on social media. The same way some media creators resort to click bait thumbnails and titles to get people to watch their videos on youtube, because the place is just flooded with content. 

I hate this game, but it works, and every time the government is seen reacting quickly to feedback garnered in such a manner just reinforces the impression that the only way to get anything done these days is to eschew the proper channels and go straight to social media. Make no mistake, doing this has likely diverted resources away from resolving another issue that was probably made through the proper channels. 

And the more people start turning to social media, the more everyone else may feel compelled to do likewise, because if you don‚Äôt, then your feedback may as well not have been submitted at all in the first place, if you think it‚Äôs going to get pushed to the back of the queue. 

So as an individual, I don‚Äôt have to care about anybody else or the ‚Äúbigger picture‚Äù. I just need to care about myself, and see to it that my own feedback is heard. Whatever it takes. 

It also raises the question of how this has flown under the radar for so long without the MP of the area realising that anything was amiss. Perhaps they just simply don‚Äôt walk the ground enough, which is another criticism for another day.",t3_k7bejk,06-12-2020

&#x200B;

The administration has communicated to me that their planning (that resulted in students having to go to campus for online learning) is justifiable because of the safe distancing measures implemented. However in reality, the sheer number of students on campus due to online/offline schedules prevent us from actually safe distancing.

Dr Goh (Chief Health and Safety officer) stated ‚ÄúBus controllers and security officers are deployed during peak hours to help ensure that safe distancing at the bus stops are observed‚Äù.

My question is, does Dr Goh work in a different university that I am currently attending? Just take a look at the Hive bus stop during peak hours and tell me again if there is safe distancing going on there. The answer is a resounding no, **because it‚Äôs impossible (to safe distance) due to the size of the bus stop and the sheer number of students.**

# What can be done then?

Before someone falsely accuses me again of hinting for an online semester, I‚Äôm not pushing for it. Plus, what are the chances the administration would do it? No students on campus = people start complaining about school fees, people staying in hall will also ask for refund.

There are other soft measures that I think can be implemented to reduce the number of students on campus.

My guesses on why students feel compelled to attend their online lessons on campus:

* Online lectures are not recorded
* Online lectures are recorded badly
* Online lectures have attendance requirements
* Online tutorials/seminars have a participation component or attendance requirement
   * These classes should have been conducted physically in the first place
* Students don‚Äôt have a suitable learning environment at home

Soft measures that could be implemented are:

**To give students the peace of mind that they will not miss out on any learning opportunity by not attending the online lecture live,**

* Make it mandatory for all online classes to be recorded regardless of faculty
   * All lecturers should be given support and guidance on how to operate the recording function on zoom/BBcollaborate
* Do away with participation grades/attendance for online classes

**All classes that can be done without discussion between students should be done online.**

* Personally, I have lectures where the lecture just talks for 2 hours without interacting with students being held in person when it could've been an online class (This class was originally online in week 1, but the lecturer changed it to physical class the week after)
* If the lecturers can find a way to tweak the learning materials to allow for online learning, it would be ideal.

**Some students don't have a suitable learning environment at home.**

* Utilize the unused exam halls to allow students who have online and physical classes a place to attend their online classes.

# Actions I have taken so far to push for improvement

* Emailed the president's office detailing the problem and possible solutions
   * The Chief Health and safety officer of NTU refused to acknowledge the problems and taichi-ed it to my faculty chair, who then pushed it to the faculty manager
      * I have since met the faculty manager and the conclusion was to get my Chair to ask the administration to meet me directly
* Tried to start an [online movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ig9yd7/uni_ntu_students_who_have_to_attend_online/) to get affected students to email the president.
* Email the Student Union about the issues and asked for their stance on the problem
   * First reply totally ignored the problem of overcrowding due to online/offline schedules and only addressed the 'no standing' rule on campus buses
   * Second reply detailed their (SU members) opinions on why my possible solutions are not in line with what they personally believe in (without giving any elaboration) and aligning with the views and direction of the NTU administration.
      * The NTUSU **claims to be our voice**, but has **failed** to gather the views and thoughts of students on the ground, instead they chose to **push** for **their own personal views** and to **act as an extension of the NTU administration**

Email thread with SU:

[Email to SU](https://pastebin.com/QSkVFTyd) \- Detailing the current problems 1) Students having to attend online lessons on campus 2) 'No standing' rule resulting in inconveniences

[SU reply 1](https://pastebin.com/29QWnQaU) \- Totally ignored problem 1) and only addressed problem 2)

[Email to SU 2](https://pastebin.com/h76pzHKv) \- Restated problem 1) and provided suggestions that might help solve the issue

[SU reply 2](https://pastebin.com/rKFS0j7N) \- Provided vague examples, pushed for the personal views and agendas of SU and academic club presidents without addressing the concerns

[Email to SU 3](https://imgur.com/a/0ehLjqB)  \- Asked for clarification regarding the vague examples given and also to substantiate their arguments

[SU president reply 3](https://pastebin.com/dmejB5Nf) \- Misrepresented my concerns and accused me of pushing for all classes to be moved online (it's alright, not the first time people have accused me of that). Made the assumption that ""I preferred online classes"" based on his misrepresentation of my concern.

[Email to SU 4](https://imgur.com/a/veIYUum) \- Clarified my stance and my suggestions again. Asked for the VP Cheryl to substantiate her points in ""SU reply 2"".

I'll just leave [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ig9yd7/uni_ntu_students_who_have_to_attend_online/g2ssjc4) here for people to decide whether I really did ""accuse you"" of doing that. Your earlier post was basically pointing out the flaws of NTU's covid-19 measures (e.g. campus is still crowded) without providing any sort of solutions to the issues presented. Thus, any reasonable person would infer that you would like the campus to be less crowded. How do we achieve that? The obvious solution that can be inferred would be copying other universities like NUS and implementing 100% online classes.

Misrepresent your argument? All I did was point out the disadvantages and problems associated with suddenly switching to 100% online classes. All I did was point out the benefits of physical classes. 

Ask you for clarifications? Initially, you were reluctant to share your suggestions with another redditor [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ig9yd7/uni_ntu_students_who_have_to_attend_online/g2t6neu). Yes, he might have been rude but my point still stands. 

(if you were up for an honest debate you should have). You want more measures to be implemented in NTU. I replied a list of my suggested measures [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ig9yd7/uni_ntu_students_who_have_to_attend_online/g2wn6n6) that you neither condemned nor supported. I was up for debate but you didn't say anything about my measures. I'm not up for debate now. 

Jumped to conclusions for the sake of getting upvotes. TIL inference = jump to conclusions. And wow, you're so incredibly salty that my comment got 30 upvotes while your reply to mine only got 1. Honestly, I don't care about upvotes. But it seems like you are really annoyed that so many redditors agree with me compared to you. But it's fine, it's part of life. There will be people that agree with you and there will be people that disagree with you.

Anyway, with today's news, I doubt much will change. For e.g., if there's a covid case in a shopping mall, they disinfect the place and life still goes on.

That wasn't your goal. Your goal was to infer (or guess?) that my ""hope"" was for NTU to become fully online. 

> I understand where you're coming from but if your hope is for NTU to change to 100% online classes, that won't happen.

 And I have explained my reasons for not including my suggestions on that thread. I did not want the focus of the thread to shift from getting affected students to email the president to a discussion of whether my suggestions would work or not - in any case, it would be a slippery slope of 'what ifs' and it would achieve absolutely nothing.

I'll let the others read your suggestions and see what they think about it. I did not bother to reply to your suggestions because it was pretty obvious to me that you were being sarcastic and had absolutely no interest in an honest debate. Let's see one obvious example:

>All students are required to volunteer (unpaid) 100 hours in AY20/21 to help with the government's efforts to fight covid-19. You may indicate your interest to help out at the hospitals or old folks home. You may source for your own volunteering opportunities or you may ask the school to assist you. Failure to meet the 100 hours quota would result in a 1 semester suspension as you didn't play your part to help fight covid-19.  

&#x200B;

>As a university student, I expected much better from you.  But unfortunately, it appears that you like ""stirring shit"" and causing controversy. 

This sounds so familiar, as if I saw it on the NTU U-wave app... It said ""As a university student, I expect that you are able to think critically"".

1497,19,fqx20m8,t3_gl7ubj,"Current law student here, would like to give my two cents on this situation.

Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, the following is just my opinion and should not be taken as legal advice or the position that the courts will take in this matter. 

For every homicide, there has to be the Actus Reus (aka the Physical Element) and the Mens Rea (aka Fault Element). When both are present, there is a prima facie offence. In the absence of any viable defences, it will be an ultima facie offence and the Defendant is convicted for his crime. On the other hand, a successful defence might result in an acquittal, depending on the situation.

The current situation:

Actus Reus is likely to be made out, since there is no doubt that the Defendant (Df) had indeed caused the death of the Victim (V). It was the stab wounds that caused V's death, unlikely to be contentious.

Mens Rea would be an issue to be discussed. Under s 300 murder, there are four possible categories that Df can fall into. In practice, for such a situation, there is a need to consider only s 300a and 300c, which would be:

 (*a*) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death; or

 (*c*) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury   
 intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

Under the recent penal code amendments, only s 300a carries the mandatory death sentence while s 300b - d carries only a discretionary death sentence, where the judge can choose to sentence Df to life imprisonment instead.

For s 300a, there is not enough information on whether there was such a direct intention to kill V. If Df were to admit that he was hanging in that area for the purposes of ""killing the next jogger that passes by"", it would be sufficient for s 300a to be made out. An intention to kill need not be premeditated and can be spontaneous. However, even if he does not admit to having such intention, looking at the facts, it would seem that V had suffered multiple stab wounds. In such a situation, the court can make an inference of an intention to kill if there was no other possible explanation for Df's conduct. It would seem that there was no motive found for Df to kill V, but motive is different from intention, though the presence of a motive would support the finding of an intention. But in any event, it would seem possible for s 300a murder to be made out.

Of course, if Df says something along the lines of ""oh I did not have the intention to kill V, my intention was to merely stab the next jogger that comes passing by, I had no intention to kill at all"", perhaps s 300c would be more appropriate. Of course, very highly fact dependent, it all boils down to what Df says, not much on the facts to warrant a more in depth discussion. In any event, we have to take note that Df had inflicted multiple stab wounds, which might sway more towards a s 300a conviction.

In any case, mens rea would probably be made out. There would be a prima facie offence of murder under s 300a or 300c

On to defences, I will focus only on the defence of Section 84 unsoundness of mind, since it is the most discussed. For the defence of Unsoundness of Mind to be made out, Df must have been suffering from an Unsoundness of Mind that negated his capacity to either know the nature of his act, or to know what he is doing is morally wrong or contrary to law. It would seem that there is not sufficient information on what is the type of ""mental illness"" he was suffering from, though it is noted that ultimately, the test for this is a legal one and not solely determined by medical opinion, though of course medical reports play a significant role. An unsoundness of mind includes any internal abnormality that affects the operation of the mind during the commission of the act, and are usually prone to recurring. It all depends whether the courts accept the evidence presented by Df on his ""mental illness"" and whether it qualifies as an Unsoundness of Mind. Note that the absence of motive in itself is NOT sufficient to prove Unsoundness of Mind, it depends on the totality of the evidence presented. 

Following which, Df must have been incapacitated to know either (a) the nature of his act, or (b) what he was doing was wrong (either morally wrong or against the law). This means that Df would have to prove that his ""mental illness"" had prevented him from, in layman terms, what he was doing, or that his illness had caused him to think that what he was doing was correct. As such, s 84 has a rather narrow application, and would not be easily invoked unless the requirements are met.

It would seem that there are not much facts to work with, the above is just my opinion. I would encourage the public to not speculate or cast personal attacks onto the Df, we do not have the entirety of the facts :) Thank you for reading!",t3_gl7ubj,17-05-2020

1529,19,fqwjxom,t1_fqwgvzv,"There are many conditions that are described under ""mental illnessess"". He may have schizophrenia, autism or down syndrome, all of which can affect how the person percieved and views his surroundings. Maybe the victim looked like someone who harmed him before, physically or mentally? He may not have the capability to process what he was doing, or the consequences of his actions. 

Looking at it, I don't think he wanted to specifically kill the victim, as the victim was still left concious and able to cry for help, and wanted to harm him instead. Unfortunately, the victim died due to the injuries inflicted on him. If he didn't understand the consequences of his action, or his mental condition influenced his ability to make the decision, would it be fair to hang him? Other cases involving intelectually disabled or those with unsound mind have had charges reduced before, namely this [case](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/court-dismisses-appeal-low-iq-teen-raped-schoolmate-11332802). 

To be clear, I am not justifying his actions. What he did was wrong, but if he had mental conditions that have the ability to impair judgement and thinking, as well as contribute to overly-violent behaviour, I don't think its fair to say ""just hang him already"" without delving deeper.

Also, declaring mental illness and not serving NS is not advisable as there are some employers that do see your NS background and would question your exemption in NS.

PES F is only for those who are deemed medically unfit for any duties, and he may have been diagnosed, but classified under PES E, which certifies him for combat support or combat service support roles only. (Driver, Cook, etc.)

My point is that there are too many what-ifs, and so many factors, like the possibility of mental illnessess that impaired his judgement, that it is too early and unfair (as of now) to say that ""He is a murderer"" and asking him to be sent to the gallows without investigation.",t3_gl7ubj,17-05-2020

Also mental illnesses could happen anytime too, a healthy person could suddenly snap one day due to stress and abuse, and become mentally unstable. 

Especially right now due this covid19 situation, there's economic recession, loss of jobs, lockdown restrictions etc. In the near future, we could see even more cases of mentally ill people that was once healthy normal individuals. Or even more hot/short-tempered people.

And we are already starting to see some of them on the news recently such as the guy that threw his furniture down his flat and broke down in tears (those close to him said that he was a nice and normal person), lady refusing to wear mask even after being told to and challenged the SDA and guy verbally abusing and threatening the SDA after being told to wear his mask properly.",t3_gl7ubj,17-05-2020

As of now, we don't know if he even understood what he did, or even know what he did. For gods' sake, he may not even remember what he did. 

As of now, before he is tried and convicted, it is unfair to scream ""murderer"". Yes, he stabbed the victim, and the victim unfortunately died as a result. That is a fact. A murder is defined as a premediated and unlawful killing of another person. However If he had a condition that severely impaired his intellectual capability at the time, he cannot be convicted of murder. 

Again, I am trying to say that the official investigation hasn't been completed yet. He is only a suspect at this point in time. The investigation isn't complete yet, there may be a hidden link in the case. We don't know. A murderer (by defenition), as a person who is convicted of murder. The trial hasn't even begun yet, and you're already labelling him as a murderer. It is unfair to him, for his family, for him to be socially tried before he is legally tried in court.

Tying back to your other comment, juries are supposed to be impartial, and look only at the evidence, and have no other knowledge of the case. In this day and age, if people just call the act murder on forums like this, label the person as a murderer, an we find a jury that is so unexposed to the case, that they haven't read other people's opinion?

However, if you planned the kill prior to getting drunk and got drunk on purpose afterwards, that is a different story. Your intent to kill was established before your decision making skills were impaired by alcohol. 

Realistically though, if you're drunk until it severely affects your intellectual capability, I doubt you will have the hand-eye coordiation, reaction time or movement speed necessary to kill someone. I don't think that there will be a situation where you get drunk and suddenly decide that you will want to kill someone (without provocation), and then actually be able to act out your plan.",t3_gl7ubj,17-05-2020

1616,19,g86h88a,t3_j7r3uk,"> # Punggol to have 50km cycling network, possibly world's densest cycling network in the next decade

> Punggol is the first Eco Town in Singapore.

> Since 2010, the young town has served as a ‚Äúliving laboratory‚Äù where new ideas and technologies are being tested in Punggol before being rolled out to the rest of Singapore.

> The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has provided an update on the development of Punggol as a smart and sustainable town over the past decade.

> To have possibly the world‚Äôs densest cycling network

> Punggol will have an extensive 50km cycling network when the town is fully completed in the next decade or so, HDB said.

> The town currently also has dual bicycle racks installed at blocks for easier storage of bicycles.

> Once the cycling network is completed, Punggol could become the world‚Äôs densest cycling network with 5.2km of cycling network per 1km2 of town area.

> This exceeds the current world‚Äôs densest cycling network in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, which has 4.7km cycling network per 1km2 of city area.

> Progress made in driving sustainability in Punggol

> Besides an extensive cycling network, significant progress was made in driving sustainability in Punggol, particularly in areas of energy consumption as well as water and waste management.

> Compared to 2010, household energy consumption has reduced by 18.8 per cent in 2018, for example. This translates to an annual energy saving that is equivalent to the annual energy use of 17, 200 four-room flats as well as a reduction of carbon emissions that is equivalent to the carbon sequestration of 826,000 trees.

> In terms of waste management, HDB has also observed a significant load of recyclables collected in Punggol. The amount of recyclables collected from Punggol is estimated to be at 1,285 tonnes per year. That is about the weight of 89 double decker buses.

> All started from eco-precinct [email protected]

> A number of sustainable ideas and technologies were tested at [email protected] back in 2010, HDB‚Äôs first public housing development with eco-friendly features.

> Features that were successfully tested at [email protected] were then introduced to the new public housing projects in Punggol from 2011 and they later became part of a standard suite of eco-features in all new HDB projects.

> Here are some examples of the eco-features implemented in [email protected]:

> Community garden, vertical greenery & green roofs

> Vertical greening and green roofs were first introduced to the seven residential blocks in [email protected] to cool the environment.

> In addition, greenery was introduced to the roof of the car park to create a quiet living environment, as the soft organic surfaces of greenery help to absorb noise from the surroundings.

> A part of the car park's roof was also set aside as a community garden to encourage residents‚Äô gardening activities.

> Energy efficiency

> The HDB flats at [email protected] were the first to have solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on the roofs.

> The energy generated from the solar panels is used to power common services in the blocks, such as LED lighting in lifts and common areas.

> Since then, 169 blocks in Punggol have been fitted with solar panels, while installation works at another 300 blocks are in progress under the SolarNova programme.

> Thermal comfort

> Another design feature which helps to reduce energy usage and improve thermal comfort is the strategic orientation of blocks at [email protected] so that windows would face the prevailing North-Eastern winds.

> This allows for less heat from the sun entering homes and improves natural lighting and ventilation.

> To cool the blocks at the [email protected] development, cool walls with enhanced thermal insulation were also incorporated into the design of the buildings.

> Simulation tools were also used to plan [email protected] to optimise environmental factors such as identifying the hotspots that need greenery to cool down the temperature, well-shaded spots to install playgrounds and fitness centres and areas with abundant of sunlight to install solar panels.

> Such tools were used to plan the Bidadari housing project later.

> [tinymce_insert_ads

> Water and waste management

> To reduce water consumption, [email protected] uses a rainwater collection system that is suitable for Singapore‚Äôs tropical climate and high rainfall.

> The rainwater harvesting system collects rainwater which is used for common corridor washing and to water plants in public spaces.

> Centralised refuse chutes for recyclables were also installed at each block to trial if providing a convenient method would increase recycling rate in the community.

> SINGAPORE: A six-year-old boy was taken to hospital after an e-scooter crashed into him near Punggol Park on Thursday (Apr 12) evening.¬†

> Eyewitness Mr Su told Channel 8 News that¬†he was jogging in the area when he saw a crowd gathering in the distance. When he approached the scene, he said he saw blood on the rider&apos;s hands and the e-scooter was damaged.¬†

> ""The boy was crying very badly. It seems he was in a lot of pain and his family members were comforting him,"" he said, adding that he believed the boy had been hit on the back of his head.

> The rider was a middle-aged man, and he apologised to the boy&apos;s family members, he said.

> ""For the e-scooter to be damaged, the impact must have been great,"" Mr Su added.¬†

> A crowd of more than 10 people had gathered, and one of them called for an ambulance, he said.

> The Singapore Civil Defence Force said it was alerted to the incident at a park connector behind the Riversails condominium¬†at about 7pm. The boy was taken to KK Women&apos;s and Children&apos;s Hospital, it added.¬†

> The police said they were alerted to a case of negligent act causing hurt at 470A Upper Serangoon Crescent. The boy was conscious when taken to the hospital, they said, adding that investigations are ongoing.

> Channel NewsAsia understands that the rider has not been arrested.

1647,19,dxagdm7,t3_8bxmuf,"Here's a repost of some of my points on our current e-scooter situation 

> Currently owners of e-scooters don't need to do the following:

>Register with TP, which enables them to evade any responsibility in an accident quite easily.

> Undergo any basic theory or practical riding lessons, which would ensure users know how to handle their PMD in a responsible manner and set a certain standard of behaviour that we, the general public should reasonably expect from them.

> Have mandatory, initial and periodical inspections of their scooters by an accredited government body, which is essential to ensure that they are road-worthy, safe to ride in a public area and most importantly, won't catch fire when they're charging overnight in an enclosed area.

> Mandatory insurance coverage for their PMD, which would ensure that any injured victims get compensated for their medical bills should the PMD user get involved in an accident.

> Jail time for committing a serious offence with a PMD. They can also own and operate a PMD even after being convicted of an offence unlike vehicle license holders, who are generally barred from operating a vehicle for a certain period of time if they have been convicted of a serious traffic offence. IMO PMD users shouldn't be getting off that easily after being convicted for a serious offence.

> List not exhaustive, feel free to add on.

> I think the gahmen needs to seriously take a look at the following and decide whether all that regulation and enforcement is worth all the trouble or just give up and ban those things already.

> The Workers' Party MPs-elect at Sengkang GRC have provided some updates on town council matters on July 19.

> The WP members that will be taking care of the GRC include He Ting Ru, Jamus Lim, Raeesah Khan and Louis Chua.

> WP's He Ting Ru updates Sengkang residents on town council matters

> The leader of the team, Ting Ru, acknowledged that there was some confusion in the past week after Polling Day results.

> Some residents have been calling the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) to report estate matters and Ting Ru clarified that the Sengkang residents can still seek help from the Pasir Ris - Punggol Town Council (PRPGTC) and Ang Mo Kio Town Council (AMKTC) during this transition period.

> Ting Ru, who is the chairman of the Sengkang Town Council (SKTC), also shared some information on the handover.

> This includes WP's team seeking documents from PRPGTC and AMKTC on July 15 a request they repeated on July 17 after a virtual meeting initiated by PRPGTC.

> Ting Ru also said that the team asked for a physical meeting to discuss further and to be briefed by the two town councils that are currently serving the residents.

> Janil: WP's Sengkang team not ready to be briefed earlier

> In response to Ting Ru's Facebook update on July 19, Pasir-Ris Punggol GRC MP Janil Puthucheary said on Facebook later in the evening that the PRPG and AMK teams are ready for a smooth handover ""as soon as SKTC is ready, in the interests of residents"".

> Janil said that the PRPG and AMK TCs chairmen designates have been ready since last week to kickstart the handover process as prescribed by the Ministry of National Development.

> He said that the initial contact with the WP's team had been through individuals who were not the elected SKTC members.

> They requested to get in touch with the SKTC Chairman and the appointed team.

> Subsequently, they had the July 17's virtual meeting with Ting Ru and fellow Sengkang teammate Chua.

> WP's Sylvia Lim, Png Eng Huat and an AHTC staff member also attended the virtual meeting.

> Ting Ru provided a point of contact the next day and the PRPGTC told her that they will be furnishing the requested contracts on July 20.

> Janil added that the SKTC team was ""not ready"" to receive the briefing that was offered on July 17 and they will be meeting again in person on July 23, Wednesday.

Not sure what this is about. Seems like someone in WP, that was not the four mp-elects, approached PRPGTC for the contracts and got stonewalled.

>	The SKTC team were not ready to receive the briefing that we offered at the meeting on the 17th July, but we look forward to discussing the issues at the in-person meeting on the 23rd July.

Seemed like SKTC wanted to see the contracts first before the discussion so that they can question PRPGTC on anything that is unusual or unexplained. PRPGTC wanted to do the briefing on the 17th without SKTC having had the opportunity to read through the contracts, but WP declined. Janil then says the WP team was not ready.

Frankly even if not ready, I would cut the WP some slack since their victory was not exactly expected and it's good on them to let residents know who to reach out to during the transition.

On your point on echo chamber, my suggestion is to just move on and don't comment on the political posts or only when you disagree with the PAP on certain policies. Then again, that's if you value karma (which I do! even if it's silly). Accept that the subreddit is an echo chamber and use it as such. Even echo chambers have value. For example, it shows what people in the echo chamber thinks. Just don't rely on it for a civil discussion.

To be fair, I will say that where's there's mixed responses (in terms of upvoted/downvotes) where outright factual errors are pointed out. The caveat is that the original incorrect comment will often, but not always, have more upvotes.

Suicide happens

Witness/Family/Friends reports

Dispatched police arrives, tapes and guards the area. Based on witness reports, 2 pairs of police officers would travel up the block to gather evidence and additional witness reports. Remaining officers on the ground will also standby near staircase exits in the event that it wasn't actually a suicide and there's a killer hiding. Usually an ambulance arrives before/with them/after. If said person gets declared DOA, police tent would be set-up to protect the body from public view and any idiots attempting to take a picture. The black box van on standby would also be called in. They'll quickly place the body into a body bag, load it onto the stretcher and push it into their black box. They will clean up the scene afterwards, but not thoroughly considering there's still blood splatters on the side of the block.

I'm just extremely frustrated I couldn't get anywhere near them before they jumped, that still haunts me. I have been fighting crippling depression for almost a decade and went through my ups and downs, I am very sure I can convince them not to jump regardless of their reasoning. I have managed to convince 2 people from going through with their suicides, but it's never enough. People need to understand that nothing in the world is a good reason to kill yourself, there's no such thing as no way out. 

Rape? Why are you punishing yourself for what someone did to you?

Bullied? Why are you punishing yourself for what people did to you? Why are you believing their insults and lower your self worth?

In debted to illegal money landers because you gamble? Stop gambling and work you fucktard, many people turned their life around while they were standing on the ledge. You can be next. Alternatively, run la chee bye!

> Two women were attacked by a wild boar in two separate incidents on the same night on Feb. 20.

> The attacks happened within 20 minutes of each other in the vicinity of Punggol Walk.

> It is uncertain if they were attacked by the same animal.

> First incident

> The first incident occurred at around 9:10pm at 308B Punggol Walk, SCDF revealed in response to Mothership's queries.

> Photos a Mothership reader sent showed the woman sitting on the sidewalk while being tended to by paramedics. Her clothes were stained with blood.

> She was conveyed to Sengkang General Hospital.

> Mothership understands that the woman is undergoing surgery today (Feb. 21).

> Bit by wild boar in second incident

> SCDF told Mothership that they received another call for assistance on the same day at around 9:30pm at 310A Punggol Walk.

> One person was conveyed to Sengkang General Hospital.

> According to Lianhe Wanbao, a wild boar had bitten the woman in her left leg. The woman was heard screaming for help.

> The boar, which refused to let go of her, dragged her along for about 1 metre.

> An eyewitness account reported by the Chinese daily said that a resident had borrowed an umbrella from her to fend off the wild boar, while a food delivery personnel rang his bicycle bell to chase it away.

> Eventually, the wild boar let go of the woman and ran off.

> Wild boar attacks

> In November last year, it was reported that a woman had been attacked by a wild boar at Sungei Api Api park.

> The National Parks Board (NParks) told The Straits Times that wild boars may associate humans with food providers when members of the public feed wild boars.

> This may then lead to wild boars displaying aggressive behaviour towards people. They might also venture into urban areas in search of human sources of food.

> Like many other wild animals, wild boars will only attack if they are cornered or if they feel threatened, and female wild boars can be very protective of their young and can be easily provoked.

> If you encounter a wild boar, NParks recommends three things to keep safe:

> Be calm and move slowly away from the animal

> Keep a safe distance and do not corner or provoke the animal

> If you see adults with young piglets, leave them alone

> Members of the public may call NParks' Animal Response Centre at 1800-476-1600 to report any wild boar encounters.

If it's a COE car it's likely not worth the value of it's insurance hence the write-off. INAL but it's unlikely he can waive off his liabilities to the vehicle owner.

> SINGAPORE - The new campus of the Singapore Institute of Technology, to be built by 2023 in the heart of the Punggol Digital District, will be integrated with industry and the community in the north-east region of Singapore, further strengthening its unique industry-focused, applied-learning model.

> When completed, the 91,000 sq m campus, on two plots of land about the size of 17 football fields, will be able to accommodate 12,000 students. This is far more than the 8,000 students in the university's distributed campuses in the five polytechnics and Dover Road currently.

> The university will be co-located with JTC's business park buildings in the Punggol Digital District, enabling students, faculty and industry professionals to work together on projects.

> For example, new ideas conceived in SIT could be tested in Punggol Digital District, enabling them to go to the market faster. In addition, companies can tap SIT's applied learning and research capabilities, as well as its talent pool in areas such as cyber security, engineering, food technology, assistive technology, allied health and hospitality.

> The university will also be a people's university as the public will be able to access many of the spaces on the ground level, including the park which conserves the forest along Punggol Road, the market village and food court facing the waterfront.

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who was present at the groundbreaking ceremony of the campus on Tuesday (Sept 10), said what sets SIT apart from the other five autonomous universities is the greater emphasis on practice-oriented learning.

> He referred to SIT's origins in the Polytechnic-Foreign Specialised Institutions scheme 14 years ago, where polytechnics partnered with a small group of overseas universities to offer niche degree programmes for their graduates.

> Related Story SIT engages with Punggol community before completion of new campus in 2023

> After running the programme for about four years, the Education Ministry decided to set up SIT in 2010 to bring all the degree programmes under one university.

> Today, as an autonomous university, SIT runs 42 degree programmes and awards degrees in its own name. Its enrolment has grown from 500 students in 2010 to 8,000 now.

> PM Lee noted the healthy 90 per cent job rate for SIT graduates and said: ""SIT's model balances meeting students' degree aspirations, while ensuring they are sought after by the industry.""

> He said now that SIT has operated for a decade and become a university in its own right, it is only natural to make the next move to a single, consolidated campus.

> He said the new campus in the Punggol Digital District will strengthen the strong nexus that SIT already has with the industry.

> ""We hope to support an ecosystem for digital and tech companies here, to trial new concepts to work, study and live, before scaling them up nationally. By being co-located here, SIT faculty and students can come together with industry professionals to collaborate on projects, and support test- bedding opportunities,"" he said.

> He also referred to SIT's many efforts to connect with the communities there, including running science camps for schools and added: ""You will be a big part of the Punggol community in the future, and I hope you can embrace this identity and have your students do their part for the people here.""

> Among the state-of-the art features of the new campus will be a smart network of over 10,000 sensors which will collect temperature, ambient light and human presence data. The data will be continuously analysed and adjustments made to enhance work space efficiency.

> It will also be the first university in South-east Asia to have a multi-energy micro-grid network, which will draw energy from various sources. The system could help SIT save energy and eliminate carbon emissions, equivalent to removing close to 2,000 vehicles from the roads.

> SIT President Tan Thiam Soon said SIT, which took in 2,700 students in the new academic year that started this month, will have an annual intake of over 3,000 undergraduates when the new campus opens in 2023. He said that SIT, which was incorporated as a university in 2009, has played a key role in meeting the Government's target of raising the university participation rate to 40 per cent by 2020.

> He said SIT is fortunate to have the strong support of the Government to build a campus at this point in time, when technology is beginning to have a huge impact on how students learn.

> He said: ""We have the opportunity to build a campus that is approachable and aspirational, fostering a vibrant environment that is both inviting and inspiring while leveraging on the technology that is available to us.

> ""It is a rare opportunity to re-imagine what a university campus, a university environment of the future will be and work towards realising it.""

> Mr Ng Yat Chung, chairman of the SIT board of trustees, said: ""We have made good progress in our journey towards a university of applied learning and I look forward to the many exciting opportunities before us in the next phase of SIT‚Äôs journey.‚Äù

IMO lrt system is much more efficient than an all bus system tho. Buses share the same infrastructure as cars etc so if there‚Äôs an increase of buses won‚Äôt it result in more congestion given how dense the population living in Punggol/Sengkang? Yeah you can argue that there‚Äôs such things as bus lane but in Punggol, where it‚Äôs mainly 2 roads either way how efficient can that get. 
Personal anecdote there‚Äôs a lrt at every 3 stops which takes around 7 min Max to complete a cycle of 3 stops. This means that the waiting time for general commuters are greatly reduced. A bus service from let‚Äôs say meridian? 2 stops away by lrt 4 stops by bus. It takes 5 min to reach Punggol mrt while a bus takes 15 min factoring in stops made at each bus stop and the traffic light. Overall I feel that the lrt system has led to an increase in efficiency for general commuter and as oppose to your stand on bus > lrt, I strongly advocate for the inception of lrt system in each heartland islandwide if it is possible. Buses can be used for transporting commuters inter heartlands while lrt can be used intra heartland.

> A 20-year-old Singaporean man was charged in court with murder on Sunday morning, May 17.

> The accused, Surajsrikan Diwakar Mani Tripathi, was arrested by the police on May 16, at 2:45am.

> The accused had allegedly stabbed a 38-year-old man at Punggol Field Road on May 10 at about 11pm.

> The deceased is 38-year-old Tay Rui Hao, who succumbed to injuries and died in Sengkang General hospital subsequently.

> Preliminary investigations showed that the accused allegedly acted alone and was not known to the victim.

> Mother of 20-year-old says son has mental problems

> The Chinese evening daily, Shin Min Daily News, reported that it understands that Surajsrikan claimed that he was heading out for a run that evening when the incident happened.

> However, it was unclear why he brought along a knife with him and eventually stabbed Tay who was jogging along Punggol Field Road.

> Shin Min also wrote that it understands that the accused returned home and rarely stepped out of the house after the incident that night.

> The police arrested Surajsrikan at home about five days later, near where the incident happened.

> A resident living at the same block as the family told Shin Min that residents saw the police entering a unit in the wee hours.

> Shin Min reported that the family members of the arrested man looked haggard and appeared to have cried before that.

> The accused's mother claimed that the 20-year-old has mental problems but did not elaborate further.

> Shin Min reported that the mother also said that her stopped schooling at primary school level and did not serve National Service, but she had written on Facebook in May 2018 that her son was enlisting.

> The accused had also hit his siblings before, according to a post by his mother in September 2019.

> Another resident whom the reporter spoke to said that Surajsrikan will usually smoke at the staircase near his unit, but he was not seen doing so in the past few days.

> The resident added that Surajsrikan's family would usually keep their door open but it was unusually quiet these days.

> Neighbours also said that while they live harmoniously with the family, they could hear quarrels coming from the house occasionally.

> Surajsrikan's mother did not appear in court as she just had a surgery recently.

> The prosecution applied for Surajsrikan to be remanded for psychiatric evaluation for three weeks, which the judge granted in court on Sunday.

> He will be remanded at Changi Prison Complex Medical Centre, and is due to return to court on June 5.

> Victim's father devastated, says son's death is an injustice

> The victim's father spoke to another Chinese evening daily, Lianhe Wanbao, on May 12 before the arrest of Surajsrikan.

> Tay's father said that the deceased was a manager at a sports apparel store.

> Tay had been staying at home since the start of the circuit breaker period and would head out for a run two to three times a week before the tragedy happened.

> On May 10 evening, Tay went for a run as usual.

> Tay's father said that when he first learnt from Tay's wife that his son was hospitalised, he thought Tay was involved in a traffic accident.

> The father then rushed to the hospital to see Tay and found out that Tay was stabbed and suffered serious injuries.

> Tay's father was devastated and said that it is an injustice for Tay to die at such a young age.

> He also described his son as mild-mannered and would not offend anyone when he was alive.

> Neighbours also described Tay as a friendly person, according to Wanbao, while Tay and his wife were said to have been very loving.

Because once PAP sees 70% or more, they gonna think you're happy with how they've performed. Human nature is such that they will not seek to improve at such approval rating. With a big lead, human tendency is to relax.

If PAP wins a particular GRC 70-30-0. verses 70-15-15. What message will that send to PAP? nothing really except they've done well (i.e. no need to change, no need to improve) and perhaps keep an eye on whoever got 30%. They won't bother with any oppo that received 15%.

There are core matters like accountability & transparency that will only change when there is a strong opposition. for e.g. when govt said no need wear masks because of experts says so, opp can counter with their own experts or proof that masks would be a good proactive solution (like HK, Vietnam did). also that wearing a homemade mask is better than not wearing anything. if we can't obtain surgical grade than use something that approximates is better than nothing.",t3_himtzp,01-07-2020

2342,19,ejq6fjv,t1_ejq2gjt,"I do feel the same too, but looking from both perspectives (not that I drive), drivers (of cars) and pedestrians both equally don't welcome PMDs and cyclists in their turfs. To the pedestrians, they may be seen as a danger to their safety since their difference in speeds. To drivers, more of an annoyance as they impede within the lanes and yet don't travel as fast as cars.

&#x200B;

While the agencies (authorities) could do more in possibly using performance based solutions (that is, providing widths of paths based on pedestrians/cyclist counts), I think that the first step to even provide segregation and cycling paths is a good way forward as we establish the basics, before trying to improve the experience of all. Afterall, it is endless if we try to design a perfect system that works.

&#x200B;

On the ends of us as pedestrians/cyclists/drivers, more understanding should ideally be established, cyclists are legally allowed to cycle along roads, pedestrians not to take up space on cycling paths and possibly mutual understanding between pedestrians and cyclists/pmds. As a pedestrian if I am walking at a slow speed, I don't see an issue giving way to cars/bikes if i'm not rushing for time. Laws and prescribed solutions won't work if the community itself don't sit down and think about the situation. 

&#x200B;

Wider footpaths, cycling paths won't help if pedestrians continually walk in both, road rage incidents still occur, cyclists not having basic road etiquette.

> For some residents living near Bedok North, the closest Community Center to them is Eunos CC.

> Take a random Bedok Reservoir location, say Block 120, and see how long it takes to get to Eunos CC.

> Neat.

> CCs are also the location where TraceTogether tokens will be distributed.

> Which, for Block 120 at Bedok Reservoir, tallies with the closest collection point as well.

> So ideally, it would function like that.

> Some though were perplexed as to why their commute to obtain the TraceTogether tokens were to be quite a bit longer.

> A Mothership reader highlighted the longer journey it would take her to collect it from Punggol CC at Hougang.

> She also pointed out it would be even more of a tedious journey for older residents.

> Take Bedok North Road Block 706, which is quite a bit closer to Eunos CC than Punggol CC.

> However their CC collection point isn't Eunos CC, but rather at Punggol CC at Hougang.

> Which is not as close to Eunos CC for these residents.

> Other Bedok Reservoir residents in Blocks like Block 725, will also have to make a longer journey.

> Interestingly enough, the block right across the road from Bedok North Block 708, which will have to collect their tokens at Punggol CC, can collect theirs at Eunos CC.

> Constituency-based

> In response to queries from Mothership, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGG) and the People's Association gave this statement.

> ‚ÄúThe allocation of CCs is based on the constituencies which residents reside in, and Tokens set aside for the CC are reserved for the residents in that constituency. To ensure that every resident who requires a Token will have access to one, we seek residents‚Äô understanding to collect the Tokens from their designated CCs. All CCs will be open for Token distribution by the second half of December, and we will ensure that everyone who wants a Token would have a chance to collect one.‚Äù

> ""This morning, a train stalled just as it was pulling into the Punggol station,"" said¬†Ms Tammy Tan, senior vice-president of corporate communications for SBS Transit. ""Service, however, continued to be available along the entire line.""

> The train ""stopped halfway"" as it was entering Punggol MRT station and passengers had to disembark using the emergency exits, according to Mr Wilson Wong, who got to the platform when passengers were being evacuated, at about 10.30am.

> ""Passengers can&apos;t get out through the normal way and (have) to use the emergency exit,"" the 44-year-old tech writer said.

> ""At Punggol station. Train doors can&apos;t open and passengers are stuck in the train,"" wrote Facebook user Eubb Hun at 10.06am.

> Punggol‚Äôs problem neighbour also had disputes in previous Toa Payoh home

> RC volunteers working closely with govt agencies to assist accused housewife and other residents

> Grassroots leaders are coordinating efforts with agencies to extend help to residents in a Punggol block where a 51-year-old housewife was accused of harassing her neighbours to the point of driving six households out.

> Meanwhile, the police have contacted the woman in question.

> The constituency‚Äôs MP, labour chief Ng Chee Meng, told The Sunday Times that its residents‚Äô committee (RC) volunteers are working closely with ‚Äúrelevant agencies, including community partners‚Äù to assist the housewife and the other residents.

> Mr Ng said: ‚ÄúThis is a complicated case with some history and we hope that an amicable outcome can be achieved.‚Äù

> An RC spokesman said agencies involved include the police, the HDB, the town council and representatives from the social services office.

> A police spokesman said that, for longstanding dispute cases such as the Punggol matter, the police will work with various agencies ‚Äúto engage the involved parties, with the aim of reaching an amicable outcome among all parties‚Äù.

> The police had previously said that reports filed by the housewife‚Äôs neighbours were for non-arrestable offences such as intentional harassment, noise pollution and mischief. They were thus advised to lodge a magistrate‚Äôs complaint.

> When contacted, the HDB said that neighbour disputes do not fall under its purview.

> The Sunday Times reported last week that six households living on the same floor as the housewife had moved out over the past two years. They complained that, since 2013, she had splashed oil at their doors, played loud music throughout the night and stomped on the floor. One said she left a pig‚Äôs ear on a shoe rack. Another said she had thrown a chair at him.

> The neighbours said they felt helpless despite multiple reports made to the police, grassroots organisations and the HDB.

> Police told them what the housewife did were non-arrestable offences, and attempts at court-directed mediation in 2017 failed when the housewife refused to agree to stop her actions.

> The case highlights the challenges of resolving neighbour disputes, especially in a dense city like Singapore where residents live cheek by jowl.

> Matters are complicated when one or more parties could be suffering from mental illnesses.

> It has emerged that the divorcee, who lives with her adult son, has moved several times and has a history of disputes with neighbours at her previous home in Toa Payoh.

> The Sunday Times learnt that she is estranged from her family who believe she could be mentally unwell. She had rejected their advances to help her. No one could say if she has been diagnosed.

> The housewife lived in a threeroom HDB flat in Bedok after her marriage. She and her husband later moved into an HDB flat in Sengkang.

> When the marriage broke down, the housewife and their son moved into a two-room HDB flat in Toa Payoh around 1999.

> During her first week there, the housewife was friendly towards her neighbours and even invited some of them to her home, said her former neighbours there, who asked not to be named.

> One 61-year-old neighbour recalled: ‚ÄúShe was very nice and asked me to go ‚Äòjalan jalan‚Äô (Malay for stroll) with her in Chinatown. She brought her son and I brought my daughter along.

> ‚ÄúBut her attitude changed very quickly. She did not disturb one neighbour. She disturbed many neighbours. She threw chicken bones outside my home and sugared biscuits into my flower pots so the ants came.‚Äù

> Multiple police reports were made and the elderly neighbour said she also took her complaint to court. A mediation session was held and the housewife subsequently stopped harassing the elderly neighbour .

> ‚ÄúBut still every night we heard the sounds ‚Äòbong bong bong bong‚Äô ‚Äì all of us couldn‚Äôt sleep. She used a pole to hit the ceiling and the floor. The old man who lived in a unit above hers moved out. He said he couldn‚Äôt take it,‚Äù the neighbour said.

> Neighbours both in Toa Payoh and Punggol felt that nothing could be done short of going to court.

> Agencies and grassroots organisations they contacted told them to be more tolerant, install CCTV cameras and to avoid contact with her.

> The police told The Sunday Times that ‚Äúif the arrested perpetrator is assessed to be of unsound mind, the police can commit the person to the Institute of Mental Health for mental health assessment and treatment‚Äù.

> A 24-year-old neighbour said he was once locked inside his flat because someone had stuck something into his padlock and he couldn‚Äôt open it with his key. His mother had to use a saw to break the lock. They believe the housewife was behind the mischief.

> Asked if the matter was reported to the police, he replied: ‚ÄúNo. She did so many things to my neighbours, they called the police but there was no use. It‚Äôs always the same officer who came down and he would tell us to just sweep and pick up the rubbish ourselves.‚Äù

> The neighbours said that the housewife did not have any visitors, even during festive seasons like Chinese New Year, and that she also believed that she was being spied on.

> In Toa Payoh, she had six to seven cameras installed outside her flat, as well as a big mirror that reflects the opposite lift lobby. Said the elderly neighbour: ‚ÄúWe complained to the RC about her cameras but she refused to remove them.‚Äù

> A neighbour who wanted to be known only as Mr Ng, 68, said: ‚ÄúEveryday she would be fighting with someone. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs normal. I think she could be mentally stressed by some personal problems. I hope someone will help her before something violent happens and someone gets injured physically. Then it will be too late.‚Äù

> It was also providing free regular and bridging bus services between both stations.

> At 10.40am, SBS Transit tweeted that it had stopped the train service between Hougang and Punggol MRT stations to repair the power fault.

> It added that a shuttle train service would replace regular train services between Serangoon and Hougang MRT stations.

> Train services between Harbourfront and Serangoon MRT stations would run at nine-minute intervals, it said.

> ""Please add extra travel time,"" it tweeted.

2524,19,g1aol6j,t1_g1ao80u,Good to hear this! Am interested in how the sums works out compared to taking a cab/grab. Are you on a subscription plan? And what‚Äôs the per trip usage? Maybe I‚Äôve yet to figure out how to justify that the meter is still running if my trip involves parking in a destination without the charge point.,t3_i8fd9n,13-08-2020
2525,19,g1aqoz7,t1_g1aol6j,"I would say it depends on your primary usage! It's best used as a direct point-to-point transportation due to the meter, without any detours along the way. I'm on the premium subscription which is $18/month, but I get 45mins free (33c / min) every month as well, so in fact I'm only paying around $3 per month every month! 

On my savings, for example a 15min trip from CBD to my house could cost me $12, but using the BlueSG meter it would only cost me $4.95! But I'd also have to walk a short distance from the charging point to my house, which I can live with given the huge savings I got. The only downside is you have to have both a car at your starting destination and a parking lot at your destination available, and I would say 40% of the time there are no cars from where I wanna depart, especially in the town area. But I've found it incredibly useful, convenient and cheap when I'm headed to my friends' houses in faraway places like Punggol and Jurong.

If you're looking to use the BlueSG to run errands at a few places for example, they currently offer 3hour ($39.90) and 5hour ($49.90) rental packages which is more value for money for the time spent! I've used these a couple of times when I know I'll be on the road for extended periods of time.",t3_i8fd9n,13-08-2020
2526,19,g1b798k,t1_g1aqoz7,"Got it, agree that in your use case it does make sense. As with most of these new tech/ services I‚Äôm glad that I do see more people using BlueSG, hope the trends continues to grow for wider adoption, pushing the prices down and opening up more usage options. The 3hours and 5 hours packages is something new, sound interesting, will check it out. Thanks for your sharing!",t3_i8fd9n,13-08-2020

2528,19,g1enbmc,t1_g1c6c40,"So far, I've been fortunate to only have been caught in a jam once in my two years, which added probably about $3 to $4?

Peak hour availability really depends on location. In my estate the cars are normally still available in the mornings as not many people drive to work, but after 6.30pm it'd be hard to find a car at Raffles Place for example. But if you don't mind a short walk / MRT ride, you could then get a car from Tanjong Pagar which tends to have more cars available until 10pm when people would drive home after dinner in the area.

I'd suggest checking out the [station map](https://www.bluesg.com.sg/stations-map) to have a rough idea of whether the availability of cars and lots meets your usage during your intended time!",t3_i8fd9n,14-08-2020

1) no motion sensor lights in the entire cluster. Lights are on all night throughout the night (hint there was a stabbing around here) 

2) very few people in my specific cluster actually uses the recycling chute because it's smaller than the rubbish chute (can't fit bulky stuff) and has no foot operated opening (people scared to touch the handle). This is from feedback stated in the resident fb group.

3) dense cycling network but for fuck? The cycling networks don't go to industrial/office places such as in yishun/tampines/pasir ris. It's only really used for leisure. People going to work still have to navigate to the cluster fuck that is called punggol central.",t3_jgczhb,23-10-2020
2540,19,g9pmu9k,t3_jgczhb,"> # After the success of Singapore‚Äôs first eco-town Punggol, what next for HDB green living?

> SINGAPORE: When it's still dark in the early morning, you wake up and switch on the lights powered by solar energy. Motion sensor lights in the common areas come alive as you leave the house, making your way down to the dual bicycle racks where you parked your two-wheeler.

> As you dispose of your trash, you separate them into two bags - one for the general trash chute and the other for a centralised recycling refuse chute.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> While this may be a vision of green living for some residents, it is already a reality for many, especially those in Punggol, Singapore's first eco-town designed under the Housing and Development Board‚Äôs (HDB) 2011 Sustainable Development Framework.

> Over the last 10 years, HDB has been progressively greening the town, test driving initiatives such as lifts with an energy regenerative system to recover 30 per cent of energy from kinetic movement and braking, motion sensor lights at staircases and car parks, as well as a centralised recycling chute.

> Rainwater collected through a rainwater harvesting system is used to irrigate landscapes and clean common areas, while the installation of dual bicycle racks encourages residents to commute through more sustainable methods.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The initiatives have helped reduce energy and water consumption and improve recycling rates.

> Between 2010 and 2018, household energy consumption in Punggol fell by 18.8 per cent, according to HDB.

> Household water consumption fell by 13.2 per cent between 2011 and 2018, while water consumption for common areas fell by 19.9 per cent in the same period.

> Advertisement

> Recycling efforts have paid off too, with about 1,285 tonnes of recyclables collected from Punggol per year, said HDB. This is equivalent to the weight of 89 double decker buses.

> In addition, the planned 50km cycling network for the town will ensure that Punggol has 5.2km of cycling network per km sq of town area, exceeding the world‚Äôs densest cycling network in Helsinki.

> ‚ÄúAs one of the youngest HDB towns, Punggol presented a very good opportunity for HDB to demonstrate sustainable urban planning and design, green technology adoption and to encourage more members of the community to lead eco-friendly lifestyles,"" said HDB in a recent press release.

> ‚ÄúEnvisioned as a thriving, smart and sustainable town, Punggol also serves as a ‚Äòliving laboratory‚Äô where, together with various partners, new ideas and technologies have been test-bedded and applied to create a sustainable, liveable and more pleasant environment for residents.""

> The green features were rolled out to all new Build-to-Order (BTO) flats from 2014, after trials in Punggol.

> 

> HDB GREEN TOWNS PROGRAMME

> As part of Singapore's fight against climate change, a key strategy in HDB's efforts to promote green and sustainable living is through harnessing solar energy.

> HDB is the country's largest driver for the installation of solar photovoltaics (PV) panels, which are located on the roofs of public housing blocks.

> Its solar target, announced in December 2019, is to generate 540 megawatt-peak by 2030. This could potentially reduce carbon emissions by 324,000 tonnes per year and generate enough energy annually to power 135,000 four-room HDB flats.

> As of March, 5,500 HDB blocks - or more than 50 per cent of housing blocks islandwide - have been fitted with or identified for solar panel installations.

> With a new SolarNova programme, HDB aims to extend this to 70 per cent of HDB blocks by 2030.

> A view of public housing blocks, with solar panels affixed to the roof of some blocks, in Singapore on Jun 27, 2019. (File photo: Reuters/Kevin Lam)

> Reducing energy consumption through harnessing solar power is one of three areas of the new HDB Green Towns programme, which aims to make towns more sustainable and liveable by 2030.

> ‚ÄúSince 2005, HDB has been driving sustainability efforts to achieve a 10 per cent reduction in annual energy consumption in HDB towns. Through the Green Towns Programme, HDB aims to reduce it by a further 15 per cent by 2030,‚Äù said the agency in March when the programme was launched.

> To reduce energy consumption, HDB said it has ‚Äúprogressively implemented‚Äù smart lighting in places such as car parks, stairwells, linkways, common corridors, playgrounds and void decks of new BTO projects since 2014.

> It added that it would work with town councils to install these lights in common areas of blocks built prior to 2014 as well when their existing LED lights are due for replacement.

> Artist's impression of the roof garden atop the multi-storey car park of Parc Residences @ Tengah, which will feature landscaping designed to promote residents' well-being. (Image: HDB)

> The Green Towns programme also focuses on recycling rainwater and cooling HDB towns.

> Rainwater is stored in an underground tank and treated before being recycled to wash common areas and irrigation.

> ‚ÄúIn this way, the use of potable water (drinking water) for washing of common areas and irrigation can be reduced by more than 50 per cent,‚Äù said HDB.

> As for cooling HDB towns, then-National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said in March that HDB was planning to conduct a pilot to apply cool coatings on building facades, roofs and pavements of several neighbourhoods, with the aim of reducing ambient temperature by up to 2 degrees Celsius.

> In addition, HDB has been introducing greenery to the top decks of more multi-storey car parks, by repurposing them for urban farming, skyrise greenery or community gardening where feasible.

> ‚ÄúBesides offering visual and spatial relief for residents in our high-rise living environment, the greenery also helps to cool and enhance the liveability of our estates,‚Äù said HDB.

> MORE OPPORTUNITIES FROM TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN

> These efforts by HDB, along with the Green Mark initiative by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) to rate green buildings, have been ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù in addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts, said Professor Subodh Mhaisalkar, executive director of the Energy Research Institute @ NTU.

> ‚ÄúSingapore is a dense high-rise metropolis with a high standard of living. Despite being in the tropics, it has established one of the highest sustainable housing standards in the world.

> ‚ÄúThis is buoyed by our HDB estates which have long relied on design principles that maximise natural ventilation, reduce heat gain, promoted shared facilities and communal spaces, and construction principles that leverage new technologies,‚Äù he said.

> These initiatives, along with the Green Mark, have allowed Singapore to become a leader in sustainable building technologies, addressed its sustainability goals and provided new opportunities to export technologies developed here, added Prof Subodh.

> The green efforts by HDB will help ‚Äúcounter the heat island effect where heat is trapped within our dense urban environments‚Äù, he said.

> ‚ÄúLeveraging natural ventilation and natural means of providing a cooler environment will naturally reduce our dependence on air-conditioning and reduce our carbon footprint.‚Äù

> But Singapore can continue to develop new technologies and designs, he said, such as combining green rooftops with solar panels, incorporating solar cells into windows and building integrated solar cells.

> As electric cars become more affordable and HDB builds more charging stations in car parks, these charging stations could be powered by solar cells and energy storage, to ‚Äúsignificantly reduce our carbon footprint from transportations‚Äù, he added.

> In constructing buildings, HDB could use new technologies in pre-fabrication construction to reduce the amount of carbon produced while manufacturing concrete used in construction, he suggested. The Housing Board could also consider using recycled materials like incineration ash or recycled construction materials for the buildings.

> Singapore should also explore ways of supporting the ‚Äúcircular economy‚Äù by reducing food waste, segregating waste streams for recycling and promoting sustainability practices, added Prof Subodh.

2701,19,eafmkm8,t3_a079os,"SINGAPORE - From 4pm on Sunday (Nov 25), Punggol residents will have a new route to get onto the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) and the Tampines Expressway (TPE), to ease congestion that has seen motorists queue an hour in traffic just to get on the expressways.


A new extension to the existing Punggol Central road will take motorists to Halus Link, which then connects to the KPE (towards East Coast Parkway) and to the TPE (towards Changi).


The works are part of a $185 million expansion of the KPE-TPE intersection, aimed at easing traffic congestion on the TPE as well as the network of roads that lead out of the north-eastern town.



The Straits Times reported earlier this month that works were projected to finish earlier, thanks to technologies such as virtual modelling and precast construction.


The Punggol Central road extension was originally slated to open in the third quarter of 2019.


Madam Wendy Tock, 53, a resident of Punggol Central, described traffic in the estate as ""very bad"".


""With the new homes springing up around the area, it's very crowded. You have to leave home by 6.45am on weekdays, if not you'll have to queue for an hour just on Punggol Drive, which is about 1km long.""


The design and construction of a 160m-long bridge spanning Sungei Serangoon - which would have normally taken about three years - was cut by up to nine months.


Mr Liu Bo, 36, a manager in the electronics industry, said he drives on the TPE to and from his workplace in Pasir Ris every day.


""Sometimes, it can take over an hour just to get to the expressway,"" Mr Liu said.


Without traffic, the drive to his office usually takes around 15 minutes.


""I hope things will be better and driving to work can be more convenient now,"" said the Punggol East resident.


By the second quarter of next year, motorists travelling along the TPE (towards Pan Island Expressway) will be able to get onto the Punggol Central road when Halus Link is open to traffic in that direction as well.",t3_a079os,25-11-2018

> SINGAPORE - A Foodpanda delivery rider is being investigated by the police and his company for allegedly duping a customer into paying cash for her food order, though she had already paid the amount via Nets.

> Human resource executive Jasmine Tan, 30, shared her experience in a Facebook post on Thursday (July 4), saying that she had ordered food to be delivered to her Punggol home at 7.30pm the day before.

> She told The Straits Times over the phone on Friday that she noticed that her order from fast-food chain Popeyes was marked as delivered on the Foodpanda app at 7.45pm.

> However, the rider only arrived with the food about half an hour after that, limping and with a bandage on his knee.

> The rider, who looked to be a man in his 20s or 30s, claimed that his electric scooter was involved in a hit-and-run accident with a car near Oasis Primary School, and Ms Tan's order was damaged in the process.

> He added that he returned to Popeyes to reorder the food, which costs $34.09, and asked Ms Tan for cash, promising that Foodpanda would refund the amount to her in six days.

> Ms Tan told ST: ""He was stammering a lot when I saw him, but I thought it was because he had an accident. I didn't think that much of it, because my children were also very hungry from waiting for over an hour.""

> Related Story GrabFood deliveryman caught on camera grabbing towel outside HDB flat

> Related Story Grab investigating case of deliveryman caught on camera taking a pair of shoes

> She paid the man the money, but was shocked to find out from a Foodpanda service representative later on that the rider claimed he did not take any cash from them. She decided to make a police report that night.

> In response to queries, police confirmed that a report was lodged and are investigating the case.

> A spokesman for Foodpanda said on Friday: ""This is an allegation we take very seriously and (we) are investigating the matter as an immediate priority.""

> Ms Tan said that after she posted about the incident online, several other people contacted her and said that they had been caught in a similar situation.

> ""The rider would always tell customers the same reason - that he was injured in an accident,"" she added.

> A staff member of Foodpanda reassured her in a call on Friday morning that it is looking into the matter, and it would process a refund within 48 hours, she said.

**Source:** Straits Times  
 **Article Date:** 23 Jul 2020   
**Author:** Rei Kurohi  
   

*Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council had originally sued for alleged losses incurred when Punggol East was under WP's watch.*

The new Workers' Party-run Sengkang Town Council (SKTC) will take over the management of a lawsuit initiated by the Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council (PRPTC), the Ministry of National Development (MND) confirmed yesterday.

PRPTC had filed the ongoing civil suit to recover alleged losses incurred by the former Punggol East SMC, which is now part of Sengkang GRC and returned to WP hands at the recent general election.

The transfer of the lawsuit will take effect at the end of this month, when the new town councils are formed following an official declaration by the Minister of National Development, MND added.

This means the WP team in Sengkang will take on the responsibility of handling the lawsuit, which was brought by PRPTC against WP chairman Sylvia Lim, former party chief Low Thia Khiang and six other defendants in the High Court.

MND said: ""As the former Punggol East SMC has become a part of Sengkang GRC, its rights and duties, including the management of the lawsuit initiated by PRPTC, will be handed over to the new town council."" It added that it was unable to comment on specific legal actions or arrangements, which are the prerogative of the respective town councils, as it is not a party to the suit.

It remains to be seen if Senior Counsel Davinder Singh, who has been representing PRPTC in the lawsuit, will continue to represent the new Sengkang Town Council.

The WP and Mr Singh's law firm, Davinder Singh Chambers, did not respond to requests for comment yesterday.

PRPTC's civil suit came after the WP-run Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) had taken the same defendants to court.

Punggol East was managed by AHTC from 2013 to 2015. In GE2015, the People's Action Party won back the single seat. It became part of Sengkang GRC when electoral boundaries were redrawn earlier this year.

PRPTC and the WP town councillors are appealing against a High Court judgment which ruled, among other things, that Ms Lim and Mr Low had breached their fiduciary duties to the town council.

The sums payable to the plaintiffs will be assessed separately.

Assistant Professor of Law Benjamin Ong from the Singapore Management University said SKTC could in theory apply to the court to discontinue the claim entirely.

""However, because the proceedings are at such a late stage, SKTC would require the court's permission to discontinue the suit,"" he said.

""Further, the court would be able to impose conditions on the discontinuance.""

Prof Ong added that even if the court allows the suit to be discontinued, it could still be left open for SKTC to restart proceedings against the defendants later on.

Outlining some possible scenarios, he said SKTC might agree to appoint an independent panel which will be empowered to carry on the litigation on its behalf, and further agree not to interfere with this litigation, similar to what AHTC did.

The Minister for National Development may also have the power to order SKTC to resume proceedings under Section 43D of the Town Councils Act, he said, adding that this is speculation on his part.

""I say it is possible because, as far as I know, Section 43D, which was introduced in 2017, has never been used before, so the precise scope of the minister's powers under Section 43D has yet to be pronounced on authoritatively by the courts.""

&#x200B;

SINGAPORE - Sixteen cats were found left in cages in Punggol on Friday (March 1), apparently abandoned by their owner or breeder.

The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) said on Saturday that it is investigating the incident after receiving feedback about 16 cats left in cages at Block 222A Sumang Lane in Punggol.

An AVA spokesman said: ""The cats are healthy and are now under the care of AVA. We will work on rehoming the cats.""

Images of the cats cramped in cages were uploaded onto a private Facebook group on Friday, before being quickly shared in public Facebook group Sayang Our Singapore's Community Cats, where it sparked an outcry.

Online netizens were angered by the cruelty of the owner for abandoning the cats, and many hoped that the cats would be rescued and rehomed.

Cat rescue group Carpurrdiem also posted on its Facebook page on Friday evening about the incident, highlighting the issue of backyard breeding.

""Backyard breeding occurs when people buy cats, and humans take the opportunity by making cats mate so they can sell them for profit,"" said Mr Nick Lim, 31, one of a group of friends who set up Carpurrdiem.

&#x200B;

The public servant told The Straits Times that there were two likely reasons that the cats were abandoned.

The cats could have been unwanted and hence abandoned by their owners, meaning they used to have homes, or they could have been thrown away by breeders, said Mr Lim.

Mr Lim said he and Carpurrdiem are quite active in helping out with cat fostering and adoption in Punggol, especially after stray dogs attacked community cats in the area recently.

He had been notified about the 16 cats by others, but was unable to head to the site as he was at work.

""Someone called the authorities and they were very fast (in coming to take the cats away), probably because 16 is quite a big number,"" said Mr Lim.

The cats will be kept with AVA unless someone pays bail to have the cats taken out, added Mr Lim.

""The irony of life is that we are paying to save lives, but the people who threw the cats away get away with it,"" said the cat rescuer.

The group, as well as other cat rescuers not with Carpurrdiem, are looking for people who are able to foster them, he added.

He said that on Friday evening, he was told that another four cats had been found in two cages, also in Punggol. They are likely to belong to a backyard breeder, he said.

A post on Facebook group Sayang Our Singapore's Community Cats on Saturday night said that another five or more cats had escaped from cages at Block 326C Sumang Walk in Punggol and were still missing.

Mr Lim said that he regularly comes across incidents of cat abandonment or cat cruelty.

Two years ago, he and his wife, as well as several friends, set up Carpurrdiem, in order to create a network of like-minded people who would be able to help with cat rescuing.

He hopes that more action can be taken against backyard breeding.

""These kittens are separated from their mothers at a young age, and these mothers are 'prostituted' again for monetary gain. This is happening because we are not reinforcing enough to nab these breeders, and we, as common humans, want to buy our cats more than adopting,"" he said in a Facebook post.

I‚Äôm frustrated what doesn‚Äôt get talked enough in road expansion projects is that in the long run they do not improve traffic conditions as more roads means more people will use their cars. 

There needs to be a better way linking Punggol, Sengkang and Pasir Ris. I have a crazy idea of building a wide pedestrian crossing across of TPE, not like your normal overhead bridge, more like the eco link in the BKE but for humans. Unfortunately a link between Pasir Ris and Punggol will have to wait until CRL is open. 

We still have a long way to go before we are car lite. Singapore, unfortunately, is still a country that encourages car ownership. 

Now, this article does a good job at putting in a good light what was done to alleviate the problem, without mentioning much on the bad design decisions that led to traffic today.

> SINGAPORE - The Housing Board will launch two new Build-to-Order (BTO) projects in the waterfront district of Punggol Point this month, each with designs that hark back to the town's rich history.

> The first, Punggol Point Crown, is inspired by the old Ponggol Zoo that was located near the Straits of Johor between the late 1920s and the early 1940s, and owned by the late William Lawrence Soma Basapa.

> The other project sees the launch of the second phase of the seafront Punggol Point Cove, which design draws reference from Punggol's first incarnation as a fishing village.

> HDB will roll out the two projects, which comprise 2,724 flats, in its September sales exercise.

> Flats available range from 2-room flexi to 5-room flats, and the projects are expected to be completed in 2024.

> The first phase of Punggol Point Cove was launched in August 2018 alongside Punggol Point Woods. The four projects together will make up the waterfront district of Punggol Point, located next to Punggol Jetty.

> Punggol Point is envisioned to be a district that embraces nature and pays tribute to Punggol's history, the HDB said in a statement on Sunday (Sept 1).

> The 1,545-unit Punggol Point Crown is divided into five thematic zones based on the natural habitats of the animal species that lived in Ponggol Zoo.

> Communal living and play areas, as well as landscaping, will reflect these design themes.

>

> For example, the playground in the Shoreline zone will include climbing elements reminiscent of stepping stones and boulders, as well as motifs of wader birds and fish, HDB said.

> Punggol Point Crown will also have an animal-themed heritage walk dotted with signboards displaying interesting facts about Ponggol Zoo's history, animals and significant visitors.

> Meanwhile, the 1,179 units in Punggol Point Cove's second phase will be housed in residential blocks built with a wave-like structure, in a nod to their seafront location.

> In recognition of Punggol's rustic village past, each block has its own courtyard and will be linked to other blocks by a series of 10th-storey sky bridges.

> Mr Lye Chung Yew, 43, who secured one of the 1,172 units in Punggol Point Cove's first phase launch, is looking forward to moving in.

> ""The main reason I applied for it was the sea view. I also like that we will have the sky bridges as it means I will have a good viewing deck to look out to sea,"" said Mr Lye, who works in the oil and gas sector.

> Mr Lye, who currently lives in Punggol, has fond memories of the Punggol Jetty area and recalls camping there in his primary school days.

> ""Back then, it was still all forested and I remember during low-tide we went out to the beach to collect sea shells,"" he said.

> ""It's a plus point for me to see Punggol's history reflected in the design of the projects as well.""

> Punggol Point residents like Mr Lye will also have the Punggol Coast MRT station, which will be ready in 2023.

> They will be able to make use of the recreational facilities at the nearby Punggol Point Park and Jetty, Punggol Promenade and Coney Island.

> The HDB said residents can also look forward to more retail and employment options in the Punggol Digital District to the south of Punggol Point from 2023.

> Punggol Point is the fifth of seven waterfront districts planned for Punggol Town, which will have 11 districts in total.

> SINGAPORE - The Housing Board has launched 4,089 flats for sale on Wednesday (Sept 11), one day after Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced higher grants and higher income ceilings for flat buyers.

> A total of 3,373 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats in Punggol and Tampines are up for sale, and they range from two-room flexi to five-room flats.

> Prices start from $109,000 (excluding grants) for a two-room flexi flat in Punggol, and from $312,000 (excluding grants) for a four-room flat in Tampines.

> The HDB noted that with the new Enhanced CPF Housing Grant giving eligible first-timer families with a monthly income of up to $9,000 up to $80,000, buyers could buy a two-room flexi flat in Punggol for as little as $29,000 after housing grants.

> Also up for sale are 716 Re-Offer of Balance Flats in mature and non-mature estates. These are unsold flats from the sales exercise last November.

> About 12 per cent of these are already completed, while the rest are under construction.

> The HDB said those with more urgent housing needs or who are less particular about flat attributes may wish to apply for these flats.

> Application for the flats opens from Wednesday and will end on Sept 17.

> In November, the HDB will offer another 4,500 BTO flats in Ang Mo Kio, Tampines and Tengah. A further 3,000 BTO flats in Sembawang and Toa Payoh will be released next February.

> In a Facebook post on Wednesday after the HDB announced the sale of the flats, Mr Wong said: ""With the enhancements announced... more first-timer home buyers will be able to access affordable housing options. I encourage you to consider your options carefully and make prudent housing choices. ""

> PAP: FOR A ""STABLE AND SECURE FUTURE""

> Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean said the PAP has been with residents ""through good times and difficult times"".

> He pointed to the ""many new developments"" in Pasir Ris and Punggol over the past 20 years and spoke of ""exciting plans in the years ahead"". Pasir Ris is due for a makeover, including a new Cross Island MRT line connecting Pasir Ris and Punggol towns and the rest of the country.

> He also flagged the new Punggol Digital District, which is set to bring education and jobs closer to home for residents.

> Ms Yeo said that although this is her first election, she is not new to serving the community, pointing to her experience working with thousands of families for their caregiving needs.

> Mr Sharael shared his experience ""working with cutting-edge technologies"" in cars, oil rigs, aircraft engines and factories across the world. Speaking about the rise of the digital economy and the expected changes to the industries as they evolve, he said he wants to work with residents to help them develop the right skillsets and create good jobs.

> Mr Tan, who has spent 30 years in public service, said he belongs to the sandwiched generation with ageing parents to look after and young children to support, and wants to help his generation as they face major changes in the workplace.

> Mr Puthucheary rounded off the speeches by reiterating Pasir Ris' ""extensive rejuvenation exercise"" and Punggol's ongoing growth.

> He said COVID-19 ""now threatens every aspect of our society"" and that ""we need to work hard and to get this right to secure our future and create opportunities for our children"".

> PV: THINGS HAVE GONE WRONG, WE WILL DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY

> Personal driver Jireh Lim, also known as Simon, spoke first for PV.

> He said that while PV may be a new party, they are not ""a stupid, irresponsible or a troublemaker party"".

> He said that ""many things have gone wrong under the present PAP Government"", pointing to the number of COVID-19 cases that he called ""horrific and an international disgrace"", and the corruption case in Ang Mo Kio Town Council.

> He also made criticisms about the Central Provident Fund (CPF), and said that PV will abide by the guiding principle of putting people first if they are elected.

> Mr Lim's other party members each flagged a specific issue. Business financial manager Prabu Ramachandran spoke about Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, saying that residents bought their flats with past governments telling them ""that the price of your HDB will not go down, HDB is a good sound investment"" and a retirement nest egg.

> SDA chairman Desmond Lim spoke in Mandarin, while secretary-general Abu Mohamed spoke in Malay.

> In the English speeches, new candidate Kelvin Ong, a facilities management officer, asked if people can keep up with the CPF minimum sum with ""the current state of wages and cost of living"".

> Another new face, electrical engineer Kuswadi Atnawi, said the SDA is contesting in these ""trying times"" to deny the incumbent the majority in Parliament, so that ""they would not pass any Bill or any policies that will cause more strain to our lives and livelihoods"".

> He listed issues such as employment, CPF, housing and cost of living, and said the party hopes to seek ""the right answers from our ministers and MPs"".

> ""Touch your heart, ask yourself ‚Äì 'Why, why did they do this to call for an election at such an irresponsible time?'"" he said. ""Shouldn‚Äôt the Government be focusing on helping people succeed? Instead, it wants to put your lives at risk. But what is done is done.""

> He also spoke of how ""there are people who laugh at us"". SDA contested in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC in the last three elections but has never won, and chairman Mr Lim was criticised for his command of English in 2015.

> ""They say - 'Why not give up, since you lost before.' And we say the SDA will never give up,"" said Mr Singh. ""And the simple reason is: We have walked the ground in Pasir Ris-Punggol for 13 years. We feel the pain of the bad policies.""

> If elected, the party will challenge the Government to return CPF in full at retirement age, use an extra 1 per cent of GDP to help poor families, tighten immigration controls and enact fair labour policies as well as stop ""irresponsible spending on extravagant government projects"".

> SINGAPORE -When its first buildings are ready in five years, Punggol North could become something of a mini Silicon Valley in Singapore - a centre of digital and cybersecurity industries that generates up to 28,000 digital economy jobs.

> The masterplan for the 50ha Punggol Digital District was launched on Sunday¬†(Jan 21) by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean at Waterway Point mall, together with an exhibition on what the district would look like. Speaking at the event, DPM Teo said the plan is to make Punggol ‚Äúa hub for key growth sectors of the Digital Economy‚Äù and that could even involve moving government agencies, such as the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore - currently in Maxwell Road - to the district.

> ‚ÄúThis will help create a new cluster of cybersecurity and technology firms in Punggol. Our residents can look forward to many exciting jobs in the future close to home.‚Äù

> The district will also serve as a testbed for a slew of new features and planning practices.

> The area will also be car-lite, with infrastructure such as parking spaces located underground. That leaves the streets for pedestrians, cyclists and users of personal mobility devices. It will be connected to other parts of Singapore by a host of new transport infrastructure, including the new Punggol Coast MRT station.

> The Singapore Institute of Technology‚Äôs (SIT) new campus will also be in the district, a move that DPM Teo said would create opportunities for students and faculty to exchange ideas with industry practitioners working there.

> The Punggol Digital District is a[ pilot project for what is being termed an ‚Äúenterprise district‚Äù,](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/punggol-north-to-be-enterprise-district-with-new-urban-concepts) with the authorities studying if this model can be applied to other areas in the future.

> JTC Corporation, which is working with SIT to develop the area, hopes to attract tech-centric enterprises specialising in areas such as cyber security and artificial intelligence to set up shop there. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong first mentioned the plans for developing Punggol North during his 2015 National Day Rally speech.

> More details - such as more flexible land use rules for the new district - were later revealed by National Development Minister Lawrence Wong in Parliament last year.

>

> The new district is a collaboration among¬†four agencies - the Urban Redevelopment Authority, Infocomm Media Development Authority, JTC and SIT.

> They envision a cluster of buildings managed by centralised systems which would handle waste collection, cooling¬†and logistics for the whole area. It could even be cooled by ""smart"" thermostats which can detect changes outdoors and adjust the temperature indoors accordingly.

> Flanking the area will be Housing Board flats, such as the upcoming Northshore Edge development, which is slated to be completed in 2021.

> Mr David Tan, who is assistant chief executive officer at JTC, said that it will be applying lessons it has learnt from other developments it has been involved in. This includes striking the right balance between work and leisure spaces, and even how closely spaced the buildings are.

> For example, buildings at the International Business Park are ""very standalone"" compared with those in one-north, said Mr Tan. Both developments are operated by JTC. ""At one-north, the buildings are much closer together and so you have more interaction,"" he said.

> Ms Lam Lee Choo, who has lived in Punggol for 11 years, said that the transformation plan will appeal to residents.

> ""The Punggol residents are generally young. They will welcome the use of technology that improves their lives,"" said the 52-year-old housewife, who is also a grassroots leader.

> ""An area that they will look forward to is the use of technology to deliver government services, so that they don&apos;t have to visit the government offices,"" she added.

The other thing to bear in mind is that after stuffing your face with seafood and beer on Ubin, the journey back is significantly harder work.

If you mean kayaking along the canals I would advise against it unless you sought a permit for access I think! Should be under PUB jurisdiction. 

Anyways, the route is rather doable, setting off from Punggol Waterfront is fine. Then you should probably head down to Coney Island/Pulau Seletar first, before crossing the channel/strait over to the western tip of Ubin. Aim towards the OBS campsite there. 

Sorry I don't have the distance on me!",t3_bza8f9,11-06-2019
