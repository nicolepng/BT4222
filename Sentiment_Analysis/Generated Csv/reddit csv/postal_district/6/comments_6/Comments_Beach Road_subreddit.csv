76,5,epw473n,t1_epw1jyj,"Uhm, you okay buddy? 

You have to remember that back in the days when the old guards were designing roads, infrastructures and such they would never have been able to anticipate the surge in temperatures resulting in more frequent, heavier rains. They merely designed our current systems within reasonable measures according to the climate back then.

Remember back in the 90s when everyday felt like it was air-conditioned? I certainly don't anymore and that attests to how big of a change over the decade alone has been. Nobody from even the 80s to 2000s would tell you otherwise.

It's not about ethics, principles or public interests. It's just climate change exceeding our expectations and because you and I don't work in the respective industry, we don't know what's the full story going in behind the scenes; like how malls magically transform overnight only because a lot of people worked zombie shifts to make it happen. Maintenance itself is a challenge due to how fixed our current drainage systems are and is hard to change. Want to make the huge drain you see along the streets bigger? You'll have to take into account the road works/blockage and many other factors that may cause minor to severe changes to current problems, such as smaller roads for either pedestrians/cars or both. 

There are probably to some levels, engineers and R&D teams working on a solution to maybe improve and make our drainage systems more efficient. They would have to do tests, conduct research and then move to a small then large to even larger scale implementation which would take ages to actually get to the final stage.

79,5,gitalda,t3_kupy69,"> # Otter pup abandoned by Bishan family at Beach Road euthanised after all possible options exhausted

> This is Eve, an otter pup who was only about the size of a human palm.

> She was so young that her eyes had barely opened to see the world.

> Otter newborn abandoned by Bishan family

> Eve was found by an otter watcher on New Year's Eve (Dec. 31, 2020) at Republic Avenue of Beach Road district.

> She was prematurely brought out of the natal holt by her family, the famous Bishan otters, but was left behind by the adult otters.

> No otters came back looking for her and the family moved holt subsequently, as observed by otter watchers.

> These were taken as signs of abandonment by the family, according to a post by long-time otter watcher Chun Kit Soo.

> According to an official statement by the Otter Working Group (OWG), it is unclear why the family abandoned otter Eve.

> One possibility is that otter Eve did not belong to the main breeding pair of the family but from one of the younger females.

> The younger pups would not be able to keep up with the family which is moving between hunting grounds.

> Otters have a complex social dynamic which could have resulted in the pup‚Äôs abandonment, OWG stated.

> This is not the first abandonment case observed in the Bishan family.

> In both instances, the otter pups were not given birth to by the alpha-female of the group.

> Eve was eventually rescued and sent to animal welfare charity Acres after seeing no signs of reunion between Eve and her family.

> A tricky rescue mission

> Eve, estimated to be only two weeks old, was much younger than the otters involved in past rescue missions.

> Hand-raising her proved to be extremely challenging.

> Those who have been following updates on the local otters will know that as an otter grows, it learns how to swim and fish with the adults.

> It takes a village to raise a child, and the same applies to the smooth-coated otter family.

> All in all, it takes 10 months for an otter pup to grow to be independent.

> So how does one provide Eve with the proper environment to grow up equipped with the necessary skills? How will the lack of social interaction with other otters affect her behavioural development?

> Here's another consideration that the Otter Working Group has to take into account: How do they raise Eve until she's ready to be rehabilitated back into the wild, without allowing her to become reliant on humans?

> Lack of expertise and facility

> Members of the Otter Working Group which includes personnel from the National Parks Board, Acres, Wildlife Reserves Singapore, otter watchers, as well as biologist Sivasothi N., gathered in the past week to discuss how to help Eve.

> Many phone calls and text messages were exchanged, and meetings were arranged for discussion and debates, Ottercity's Facebook post said.

> Unfortunately, the group came to the sad conclusion that no one is experienced enough, and Singapore does not have the right facility to raise this otter pup.

> One of the key constraints is the lack of a large rehabilitation space that mimics otters' habitats e.g. rivers, lakes, or ponds for semi-aquatic animals.

> The zoo also does not have a smooth-coated otter collection to take in Eve.

> If Eve were to be left in the wild, she is unlikely to survive on her own.

> With the above considerations, ""every step will be so experimental that it will be at the expense of Eve"", Ottercity explained.

> Euthanasia is regrettably the last resort

> After studying overseas cases and exhausting all possible options, the team made the tough decision to euthanise Eve.

> This is especially so when smooth-coated otters are listed as 'Vulnerable' on the IUCN Red List since 1996. This species, threatened by loss of habitat and illegal pet trade, is at high risk of extinction globally.

> The OWG said:

> ""With the potential for successful rehabilitation unlikely, and in consideration of animal welfare, the OWG therefore made the difficult decision to euthanise the otter pup on humane grounds. ...[The OWG] values and understands the importance of the conservation and welfare of our wildlife, and the decision to put down the otter was not made lightly.""

> Eve died on the afternoon of Jan. 7.

> The otter community said that this is ""an outcome that none [wish] to see"", but is a result of limitations that the team has to accept.

> Following the euthanasia, a necropsy will be conducted by WRS to investigate if there were any health issues that contributed to otter Eve's abandonment.

80,5,givvmn5,t3_kupy69,"I just want to point out the difficulties involved in hand-rearing very young wild mammals, which require round the clock care for weeks, if not months. Even zoos, with the resources and facilities at their disposal, usually prefer to let the mother raise the young; hand-rearing is usually a last resort. Orphaned babies will be even more challenging, especially if it belongs to a species that's not already represented in the collection.

The challenges of hand-rearing and rehabilitating very young otter pups can be shown by looking at the guidelines written down for other species that are well-represented in zoos and other captive collections.

[Hand Rearing 1.1 Asian Small Clawed Otter (*Amblonyx cinereus*) 21 February 2007 through 2 July 2007](http://www.otterspecialistgroup.org/Library/TaskForces/OCT/HAND_REARING_ASCOTTER.pdf)

Highlights:

> **Hand-rearing is not recommended as an elective process for various reasons**. In almost all cases, the philosophy of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) managers is for the offspring of captive born species to be parent-reared. At times this goal cannot be reached. **When an animal requires hand-rearing it is very important to have a clear and well planned course of action for all staff. The dietary, medical, and social needs of the species must be included in the hand-rearing protocols**. 

> ...

> Fortunately for these two pups they have each other for companionship during the handrearing period. We believe this was beneficial to their well being and contributed to their physical and mental development. They were definitely bonded to the keeper staff, but they played with each other and competed for space in their enclosure when they were not being handled.

Here's another relevant document:

[Successful Hand-rearing and Rehabilitation of North American River Otter (*Lontra canadensis*) Section 1 ‚Äì When to rehabilitate, young pup care, formula feeding, and weaning.](https://www.otterspecialistgroup.org/Library/TaskForces/OCT/North_American_River_Otter_Rehabilitation_Section_1.pdf)

Highlights:

> To maximize the chance of successful rearing and potential release of rehabilitated otters these questions should be asked first:

> * Does the rehabilitator have adequate facilities and time to raise the animal properly?
> * Does the rehabilitator have adequate funds to supply formula and weaning diets to, and perhaps after, release?
> * Is there an appropriate release area available? What is the current state of the otter population in the area?
> * Are facilities and resources available to support and monitor release?
> * Is another rehabilitator more qualified and/or does someone else already have an orphan(s)? If so, it is better for the orphans to be raised together. There is a lower risk of imprinting and they learn from one another.
> * Does the rehabilitator have access daily to large amounts of whole fresh fish?
> * Does the rehabilitator have access to live fish and a pool with a fresh water source for the animal to fish and swim in?
> * Does the rehabilitator have an established relationship with an experienced otter veterinarian?
> * Does the rehabilitator already have an otter diet, husbandry, medical, and release plan established?
> * Does the rehabilitator have a suitably isolated, natural pen (no dogs and limited human presence) where the orphans can be placed as they become more independent?
> * Does the rehabilitator have facilities to hold the otter for at least 9 months?
> * If release is not an option, rehabilitators should begin researching good placement options early.

> If the pup is indeed an orphan and the decision to hand rear is made, the following rules apply.

> * Know the animal's natural history and development time line.
> * **Have as few care takers as possible (ideally just one). Keep human contact to a minimum. The animal will not be releasable if it becomes imprinted, tame, or too accustomed to humans**. This becomes even more critical in the case of single pups.
> * **Few otter pups are suitable for release**. Before this is attempted experienced professionals should be consulted and a plan put in place.
> * Do not house these animals near human or pet trafficked areas.
> * There must not be any positive exposure to dogs.
> * Be prepared ahead of time for the next stage of the animal's growth so he/she need not face undue delays when reaching the next point in development.
> * If you receive a single pup, network with regional rehabilitators in an attempt to locate another orphan(s) so **pups can be raised together**. Otters are very social, active and playful and do much better in groups than when raised alone. The development of normal social behavior skills, natural companionship, healthy competition, added body heat, and physiological comforts are just a few of the benefits of rearing otter pups together. 
> ...
> * **Raising a single otter pup to successful release can be challenging but is possible. This is not the preferred method**.

Even if the Singapore Zoo or a very dedicated individual was able to commit the time and resources to care for this lone pup, what next? Rehabilitation and release is next to impossible, since it will have grown up without the necessary social interaction and guidance of its parents and siblings, and lacking most of the basic skills needed to survive as a wild otter. It can't be introduced to the Asian Small-clawed Otters or Giant Otters that are already in the WRS collection; they're different species and there's a high likelihood that any attempt to mix them will result in bloodshed. Keeping her alone in captivity would not be a great outcome either, for such a sociable species. Hand-raised by humans, she would not have fully developed the necessary skills to actually behave like an otter, and it's unlikely that she could be socialised to the extent that she could be paired with a male of her own species in future and contribute to captive breeding efforts. 

Sure, she could live as someone's pet, but is that really ideal? Just because some people keep otters as pets in some countries doesn't mean that it's easy or even feasible - and note that nearly all of these pets are Asian Small-clawed Otters, the smallest of all the otter species. Smooth-coated Otters grow larger, and apart from zoos, the only people who keep them on a regular basis are some traditional fishing communities in Bangladesh, which as you would expect, live in a very different setting from Singapore. As [this site](https://pethelpful.com/exotic-pets/pet-otter) says about the prospect of keeping pet otters (referring to Asian Small-clawed Otters):

> They are considered to be very high-maintenance, as you would imagine. It takes a tremendous amount of time, effort, patience, and experience to house them, provide them with enrichment, and keep them safe and secure. No matter how much you fantasize about them, you must accept the fact that they are not house pets. Otters are not ferrets; they are not animals that should be kept with the intention of cuddling it.

Even if she managed to survive to maturity, there's a high chance that she would be imprinted on the person who raised her from young, and that person is pretty much stuck with her for the rest of her life. So that person will have to make some dramatic adjustments to their lives in order to accommodate the needs of their ""pet"". In the end, you're left with an otter that doesn't know how to be an otter, probably with separation anxiety, but not exactly tame and domesticated to the same extent as a dog, cat, or even a ferret, with space and other living requirements that most people in Singapore would find difficult to meet, a high risk of being developmentally and socially stunted in many respects because it was raised without any interaction from others of its own species, and that's not even going into the reasons why it was abandoned by its own family in the first place.

As a pet owner, this is a phrase that is uttered many times to me and to others. Raising an animal can be tough, even more so for a non-domesticated animal, considering otters are extremely social and territorial creatures.

They need adult otters to properly teach the young how to swim, hunt, build a home, survive and they need a lot of space for this. 

While they may look cute, otters are known to attack, kill and practise cannibalism especially on unfamiliar/weaker otters.
