1,2,e8nmboq,t3_9sc0re,"> Jeyaretnam was re-elected at the 1984 general election, but lost his seat in Parliament in 1986 following a conviction for falsely accounting the party’s funds. His conviction was subsequently overturned by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which called the conviction a **“grievous injustice”.**

unforgettable part of singapore history. lky later throw tantrum and pulled singapore out of the privy council system. 


this really puts in perspective the recent cases of ppl getting sued for questioning the judiciary on fb............................

2,2,e8nm9xk,t3_9sc0re,"> Goh said described the discussion with Lee Kuan Yew after Jeyaratnam’s victory as such:

> “There was a post-mortem. And that was how you learnt again. It was a quick post-mortem, but we all knew the reasons. But it was also looking forward. So, you learnt that what had gone, had gone.

> “We called a meeting of all MPs and the question was: What do we do now in Anson? Do we continue to run the community centre (CC) in Anson or do we pass it on to JBJ (JB Jeyaretnam)?

> “I felt that we should pass on the CC to JBJ. And many of the young ones felt so. I thought we should be fair – he had won, so pass on everything to him. The CC was part of Anson and we should pass it on. British parliamentary rules – accept it and shake his hand. Write him a congratulatory letter and so on. That was the thinking of the younger ones, the MPs.

> “LKY (Lee Kuan Yew) never scolded us but he asked the older ones. And they said, no, we do not pass it on. We keep it, this is our base. You pass it on to him, he would be entrenched and we would never win Anson back again. This cannot be done. So, you learn.

> “Yet, what is the reason to justify keeping it? This is part of government facility. CC is part of the government – you do not pass on part of the government to the other side.

> “We young naive ones thought the CC was part of the constituency’s institutions and we had to pass it on. The older ones said, no.”

now the cc is under PA~~P~~. 

never say why he didnt put CC under respective MP when he was PM. ",t3_9sc0re,29-10-2018

5,2,e8o2xfq,t1_e8nmboq,"Again, I'd like to say that you can be fucking perfect and you will still get sued or worse.

You can't win when the opponent can simply change the rules at a whim.",t3_9sc0re,29-10-2018
6,2,e8p3d60,t1_e8nm9xk,Wut... So he is actually saying he was mistaken and he 'learned' that he was wrong to do the 'naive' gentleman's thing ,t3_9sc0re,30-10-2018
7,2,e8pjkdq,t1_e8nm9xk,"> now the cc is under PAP.

Technically, they're under the People's Association, which is a statutory board (like HDB, STB, the polytechnics etc). They are _supposed_ to be apartisan.

> never say why he didnt put CC under respective MP when he was PM.

Imagine if political parties started getting sued by ""their residents"" for mismanaging CC's now. Oh wait…",t3_9sc0re,30-10-2018

9,2,e8pd20b,t1_e8p9okx,Yeah I thought that he was continuing the tradition of PAP old generation stalwarts like Inderjeet suddenly finding their voice after leaving the party. Oh well.,t3_9sc0re,30-10-2018
