0,2,er0p0pz,t3_c03ud4,"The Ottercity page on Facebook has identified this as the Zouk family, comprising three adults and a litter of three pups, which had a den close to Jiak Kim Bridge along the Singapore River. However, they have been wandering a lot these few months, possibly due to conflict with the Bishan family, whose territory also includes the same stretch of Singapore River. Hopefully they didn't get too lost, and managed to find their way back to the canals.

Kudos to the people who controlled traffic and stopped the otters from becoming roadkill. But the members of the public standing around taking photos could be an issue, especially if the otters were trying to get somewhere but people got in the way, potentially forcing them to spend more time on the road. If the pups got separated from the adults, things could have gotten a lot more complicated, possibly even bloody for any bystanders who got too close.

I've seen people excitedly get between a wild boar and its piglets, and we had to get the crowd to stand back and clear a path so that the piglets could rejoin the sow. I've also seen people get chased by monkeys and heard of someone getting bitten by a viper, all for the sake of close up shots with a phone camera. People really need to remember to respect wild animals' personal space.",t3_c03ud4,13-06-2019

Violent territorial battles between rival otter clans have been witnessed in Singapore on several occasions, and during some of these clashes, pups gets mauled to death. The Bishan family is very popular and loved by many, but it's also been the dominant family in this part of Singapore; hopefully the small Zouk family can continue to stay out of their way, while also avoiding trouble from humans.
