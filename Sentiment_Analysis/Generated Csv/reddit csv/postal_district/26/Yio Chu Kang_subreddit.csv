5,26,About Yio Chu Kang Constituency,24,hl32mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hl32mq/about_yio_chu_kang_constituency/,8,04-07-2020,"Just read a pamphlet distributed for local candidate, which featured this as the center page:

*The Yio Chu Kang Constituency will join up with Ang Mo Kio GRC and Kebun Bahru to form one big town council together, if you elect me as your MP in the election.*

I am trying to understand this: Changing YCK to SMC means it has to have own TC or join a neighbour TC. However when YCK was within AMK GRC it was already under AMK TC. So this promise to solve a problem did not exist before 2020. 

So what am I missing here?"
