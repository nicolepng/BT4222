Roads around Shangri-La Hotel, such as Anderson Road and Orange Grove Road, will also be affected by road closures and security checks from June 10 to June 14.

Commercial vehicles will be prevented from entering Anderson Road and are advised to use Ardmore Park via Draycott Drive or Draycott Park.

Buses 7, 36, 77, 105, 106, 111, 123, 132, 174, 174e will also have routes affected.

Most likely there will be more bag checks and guards patrolling at the Orchard, Somerset MRT stations as well. I would also expect larger crowds at the MRT since buses and roads are affected. Other stations along that line might be affected too. Stay away if possible!"

1. Is Tanya, Li Yan and Bhaskar’s daughter?

2. If so, does anybody know which episode it was that Tanya first arrived and when Bhaskar found out about her? 

I’m asking these questions cause I have the faintest memory about an episode where Bhaskar was freaking out about something to Li Yan.

Thanks guys!"

So I'm curious to know if anyone has any photos of inside the old campus. For example, I heard that the classrooms were cells for prisoners arrested under the Internal Security Act, so I want to know how they look like haha. This isn't for any school project, this is just for my own curiosity. Also, if possible, maybe you could share how is the experience of having to move from studying at the Tanglin campus to the Woodlands campus."

My focus is strength training but cardio is important for me as well.  I checked out True Fitness in Great World City and was very disappointed.  There’s gotta be something better!

Edit:  I am looking more towards a hardcore bodybuilding gym, with a wide variety of free weights apparatus, benches, machines, dumbbells, etc.  Classes not a priority, nor are the gyms that require a personal trainer (seem to be so many of those here).  Atmosphere is key, so ideally it is a place where a lot of other meatheads like to train."
