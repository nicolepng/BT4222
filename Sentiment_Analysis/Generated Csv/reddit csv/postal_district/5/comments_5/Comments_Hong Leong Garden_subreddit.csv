5,4,gmezdbl,t1_gmeykoa,There's also a Japanese restaurant there now when it reopened at Newest called Hakata Japanese Restaurant. The food is generally good and there were Japanese magazines stacked on the racks which was similar to the old Japanese restaurant. Makes me wonder if the previous owners reopened it under a new name.,t3_leld8z,07-02-2021
6,4,gmhlwu1,t1_gmeykoa,Yes! An old schoolmateâ€™s family ran the restaurant (if you and I are remembering the same restaurant.) It served super homely japanese fare. She was already quite old when I used to go though so I suspect they are not running a restaurant anymore.,t3_leld8z,07-02-2021

8,4,gmk0gi4,t1_gmjzltp,Yeah!! I also kept on looking at the car dealer as I was a car crazy kid back then. I once even tried running into the dealer but was stopped by my grandmother.,t3_leld8z,08-02-2021
