4,4,Unpopular Opinion: Dover forest should be destroyed,232,lj1uzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/lj1uzp/unpopular_opinion_dover_forest_should_be_destroyed/,224,13-02-2021,"Unlike the so-called popular ""unpopular opinions"" that this subreddit is known to conjure in the past, I have great confidence that this opinion of mine will be unpopular. **If you guys find this opinion substantive, even if you disagree with it, do give it an upvote so that others can see it.** I will speak in terms of both the monetary and the environmental costs. Anyways, let's start by talking about why the forest should be destroyed for residential purposes.

**1. It’s in a prime location for housing.**

Look in your satellite imagery. Stare at the forest. Do you see what's next to it? **Dover MRT station.** You rarely see these days that there are empty plots of land next to an MRT station. Especially in this central-west region. Imagine the number of people who will benefit from such convenience of living in some high rise property next to an MRT station!

**2. It is a way to promote social mobility.**

Many people do like the lottery effect, which such rare BTOs provides, for it is the only easy shot for such lower-income people to achieve social mobility. **Ask your conscience.** Is it right to take away this mode of social mobility from them, like how you have benefited from it, once upon a time? Many families' lives can be significantly altered because of this, and hence it shouldn't be taken lightly.

**3. Saving this forest destroys other forests.**

Remember the days where the beauty of Clementi forest was in the [news](https://mothership.sg/2020/10/clementi-forest/), and everyone was rallying for its conservation? Unfortunately, since then, the tunnel-visioning to preserve Dover forest has resulted in other more ecologically significant forest being neglected. As we speak, deforestation is happening on a much grander scale in Tengah than Dover would ever hope to experience. Why are we not worrying about that?

Also, Dover is not in a good state for preservation. It's not even a forest, but merely an abandoned plantation, with a sheltered walkway cutting it into two halves. **Heck, my secondary school has already eaten into a massive chunk of the forest.** It's not like you can integrate it into a nature corridor for animals which walk, at most it will be merely useful for migratory birds. Come on people; we can do better than to look at the low hanging fruit and forget that there are better ones out there worth preserving. Quite a considerable **opportunity cost** to save this forest, I'd say.

**4. Saving this forest causes more long term pollution through commutes.**

If Dover is preserved, the potential households who could have lived there will have to live elsewhere, further from the city. They will also contribute to the overcrowding of existing or future towns. And these additional, longer commutes from new towns that are further away than Dover, will lead to more traffic congestion, pollution, and energy consumption. Its simple secondary school Physics: **E = F•d.** More energy is required to accelerate the same mass of people over a longer distance. Until renewables power all our commutes, longer commutes from building elsewhere is worse for the environment in the long term, as everything is powered by fossil fuels. And if you speak in terms of monetary costs: Remember, people who live further away from the city pay more to get to the city; that's how distance fare works.

**5. Preserving this forest benefits the wealthy; destroying it reduces class segregation.**

This is not so much of a benefit of deforesting Dover, but it is one [food for thought](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/lanej6/rant_am_i_the_only_one_who_feels_as_though_the/). The people that benefit the most from the preservation of Dover forests are the wealthy landed property owners living up north, whose property prices will drop if high rise HDBs are built in the forest, due to a lack of privacy. The estate up north won't feel as exclusive anymore, with plenty of ""lower class"" people looming over their heads down south. [That's why there can often be violent objections to public housing built near landed properties in other countries.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eGTU_uXLKk) But, if you want to ensure greater social cohesion and reduce the level of class enclaves in Singapore, this is one way to encourage their intermingling.

==========

And now, to address common objections against developing HDB flats in Dover Forest.

**1. Why don't we stop importing foreigners?**

First of all, if I'm not wrong, purely foreign households cannot buy HDBs, so stopping the import of foreigners isn't going to make any difference in this case. Maids live with Singaporean households, and foreign workers live in dormitories. So they aren't exactly contributing to the spike in the domestic public housing demand, are they? **(Mic drop)**

Anyways, recently [CNA ran an article](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hdb-household-smaller-size-multi-generation-sample-survey-14160170) on a changing taste and preferences of Singaporeans when it comes to the household structure, and Singaporean households are getting smaller, with more one-person households and fewer inter-generational households. That may explain why there are still more and more households even though the population of Singaporeans living in HDB flats is getting smaller. If you are always looking for people to blame for this issue, you can blame Singaporeans like you and me.  So now we've got the xenophobic argument out of the way. Next!

**2. Why don't we develop elsewhere, like golf courses?**

**Surprise, surprise!** We've been doing that this whole time! Guess what? [It has been going on for a while now.](https://www.todayonline.com/sports/govt-reacquire-land-2-golf-courses-3-give-land)

However, there are limits to what can be done with golf courses. Let's look at some of the far-flung one like those in Tanah Merah or Tuas. **Touch your heart and ask yourself, do you seriously want to live there?** There are a few problems. Firstly, for those far flunked regions, [a commute to the city will easily take an hour.](https://medium.com/@yinshanyang/isochronic-singapore-a-gentle-introduction-to-isochrone-maps-9cceebc72f60) Those who live deep in Pasir Ris, Sembawang, Jurong West, and those far flunked new towns, I can feel you. It's a tragedy. Ideally, it will be great to minimize the number of people living that far from the city, which will add even more to the congestion and crowdedness of commutes, causing even more pollution. That's why we should develop Dover Forest.

Secondly, urban planning is a complicated subject; there's a reason why the golf courses are allocated to be in such geographically useless locations. **This makes its redevelopment tricky.** For example, those golf courses in Tanah Merah are right under the flight paths of Changi Airport. Can you imagine the noise pollution level that the residents have to bear if they live under the runway? What about the one in Tuas? Bear in mind that Tuas is a heavy industrial area that may have quite a bit of pollution. [If the pollution from Pasir Gudang at Punggol is already that bad](https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/hdb-punggol-pasir-gudang/), imagine living next to the factories in Tuas.

And for those people citing Sime Golf Course as a potential location for residential given its central location, I don't think it's a good idea to live that close to our biggest nature reserve. The environmental destruction caused by human activities on our biggest nature reserve won't be negligible. Also, some plot of land nearby has already been zoned for residential, so now you have your answer.

**3. How about we use those empty plot of lands or abandoned buildings nearby?**

Firstly, **how sure are you** that the plot of unused land will stay unused in the future? Just go and look at the [URA Master Plan](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/) and you can tell that every inch of land in Singapore has a purpose of its own. Eventually, even that plot of land that you cited is going to be used as well. And before you accuse me of a false dichotomy, well the thing is, I'm not even presenting you a choice on where to develop. It's not a matter of what; it's a matter of when. The plan all along is to have enough land to carry out this development cycle until the first of the 99-year leases run out.

Also, not all plots of empty land should be used immediately. There is always a need to have some vacant land plots everywhere, which can be tapped on in case of emergencies. Remember the migrant worker Covid-19 fiasco? The government had to allocate spare land to build some middle-term dormitories, and there's one at [Choa Chu Kang Grove](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/migrant-workers-move-into-first-quick-build-dorms) which you can see from the train between Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang stations, sitting on vacant land. If there wasn't any vacant land, how would they be able to build these quickly? Also, you need some space for election rallies. Yeah.

**4. Why don't we just en-bloc old buildings and build higher?**

Anyways, when environmental enthusiasts mention the word en-bloc, you will bring a new point of contention with heritage enthusiasts. **Environmental and heritage conservation, they are often in conflict with each other.** With each en-bloc, some of Singapore's cultural heritage gets destroyed and will never be seen again. [Would it not be sad if you look back one day and there aren't any real tangible objects in the form of point and slab block HDBs you can be nostalgic about?](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/partial-conservation-dakota-crescent-gives-heritage-enthusiasts-hope)

Besides that, one does not merely demolish HDBs and build something with an even greater density in it. You have to remember, that when you build 4 times higher, you generally have 4 times the amount of people living in the same amount of space, the traffic that the roads and public transport network below it increase multifold. Can the streets handle such traffic? If not, can they be widened? Are you able to build more MRT lines to take additional commuters? And do you have space for more bus transportation?

It is also observed from artist impressions that [flats in Dover forest will be about 30 stories in height.](https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/ulu-pandan-bto-flats-2021-prices-hdb/) So, don't worry about the plot of forest land being poorly-utilized.

**5. Wouldn't the destruction of Dover forest worsen the urban heat island effect?**

That's one valid argument to preserve Dover forest. **But I would say that's a reason to destroy Dover forest as well.** Perhaps not in its entirety; the northwestern part of the forest, which is much less fragmented, still has some preservation value. But think about it. By destroying a part of the forest, you maximize the number of Singaporeans who can enjoy the lowered temperatures that the forest's remaining sections provide. It will no longer be an exclusive thing for the wealthy landowners and those living east of Clementi, but for these new Ulu Pandan HDB owners as well. Wouldn't that be great?

==========

So, I guess that's all the pointers I have on this issue. Hope we can have a constructive discussion below in the comment sections regarding this alternative point of view that seems to be out of most people's mind."
5,4,[RANT] Am I the only one who feels as though the Dover Forest issue has a lot class elements to it?,176,lanej6,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/lanej6/rant_am_i_the_only_one_who_feels_as_though_the/,169,02-02-2021,"Context for those unaware: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-land-preservation-housing-clementi-dover-forest-14075252](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-land-preservation-housing-clementi-dover-forest-14075252)

Who are the people who are opposing Dover Forest developments? Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel that many of those who oppose development on Dover Forest tend to come from an upper/middle class. Most or all of my own peers, who have never lived in such expensive areas would love the opportunity to buy a home in such an area. There's even a couple of top-tier primary school within 1.5-2km from there (Henry Park, Fairfield). And the ones who have come out in opposition to the development are mostly rich people who live in that area. So it really feels like a ""F-U, I got mine"" type of scenario here. 

What's worse is that the same people who oppose it have the most classist sort of responses. ""Why not build in Paya Lebar Airbase?"" ""Why not build over golf courses?"". Do you know where the airbase is? Have you seen where most of the golf courses are? They are in the most ulu parts in the middle of nowhere. And asking the government to buy over these golf courses/landed property will just add more costs to new homebuyers. But who cares about them, right? We got ours already.

If it was really an environmental issue, one has to wonder where was all this concern when they were bulldozing Tengah Forest? It takes up a much much larger area and is more important (for biodiversity) than the Dover Forest. But Tengah Forest of course doesn't get as much attention, because no one lives there. Its all the way in the West and nobody cares about that area. 

I dont see any difference between these pseudo-environmentalists and having NIMBY syndrome. Remember when the govt tried to build worker dorms closer to residential areas and so many racist boomers freaked out? The parallels are striking and the environmental issue seems so fake. All these so-called ""progressives"" too. They say they want more equality, more access to good primary schools for young couples. But when the idea to build more houses in these areas comes up, it gets shot down. 

Thus far, there has been no ""alternative"" solution that offers the same or more area, at the same price, with the same or more amenities (great primary schools and distance to city centre). All the solutions seem to just be ""let the young couples live far away in some area that nobody wants"". Like that might as well tell govt to buy land in JB and build houses there."
