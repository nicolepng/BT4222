You have to fill in a form and go through an audition at NAC. Your license will only permit you to busk in areas assigned to you. 

I did study in a music course when I was younger so I know this because a bunch of my friends went to get one. It’s not difficult to get one but if all you want to do is play music it’ll seem like it‘s more of a hassle than it’s worth.

It's done whenever there's any chance the fire may spread sideways, and especially if the adjacent structures are particularly dangerous if they're on fire (oil tanks, highly combustible storage materials, etc). 

You'd normally use a water curtain for this by using ground monitors (found in the fire engines), Rosenbauer monitors (mounted on the fire engines), or apollo monitors (mounted on the red rhinos). Even bigger monitors are mounted on even bigger vehicles for even bigger fires like those you'd see in highly industrialised islands like Jurong Island. There literally is a vehicle called Large Monitor Vehicle in the Jurong Island stations.

But I don't think that's what he was doing la since the amount of water will only evaporate into steam. Part of the training emphasises on using hosereels while the real jets are being set up, but I don't think it's really useful for such a fire.

I was in my no.4 uniform (reservist) having McDonald's at Clementi Mall for breakfast with my other buddies. 

A not-so-old man (probably 50s) approached us and asked to borrow phone to call police because ""a China man stole his phone"". We didn't give in at first and offered to call on his behalf. He then refused and then started to ask for money, $10 to be specific, from each of us.

I said no, but I told him that I'm willing to give him $2 instead, to make his whatever phone calls, etc. He then candidly said to me that he is ""not so cheap"" so the $2 is like an insult to him.... (in my mind I was like wtf?)

That's when I told him sorry, please find some other table. 

Moments later I saw him approach ~~his next target~~ a teenage girl, probably still in her studies. Not sure if he was successful or not, didn't care much.

After our breakfast, saw him just outside the McDonald's, using a phone. Probably his, probably someone else's that he managed to con, idk.

It was my first time encountering such an issue and I didn't know what to do. On hindsight maybe I should have informed the cafe staff and ask them to help look after him while waiting for his mum?

Anyway I ordered the ice cream and coke for him and while waiting for the order to be ready, I talked a bit with him. Found out he has 2 toddler siblings that he doesn't like and no, he doesn't ask people for money everyday, just today because he forgot to bring his money. When the order was ready, he went to collect it and ran off.

514,20,fkjdxdf,t1_fkh3wgq,"I personally think the GRC system allows a party to build a team with people of complementary skill sets which can serve their constituents better. One person can work the ground perhaps, another with great town council management skills, one with financial expertise etc. I much prefer it over having to entrust an area to a single individual who isn’t well rounded enough.

We are land-poor but talent rich. Why not have a different system of representation compared to other countries? We set up every aspect of our society to maximize our advantages and minimize our weaknesses. Why not governance and representation as well?",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
515,20,fkjf7h2,t1_fkjdxdf,"They're both sides of the same coin, inho. And while it does sound good on paper, the current practice is for MPs to be allocated certain neighbourhoods/precincts that they're in charge of, which is not much different from that of running a SMC. It is also quite hard for MPs to cover overlapping areas to ensure well-rounded support for the people, as a single neighbourhood alone consists of multiple families, let alone trying to canvas multiple neighbourhoods at once.

There's also the thorny issue of GRCs being used to ""parachute"" (allegedly) otherwise unelectable newcomers into parliament. Take Dr Koh Poh Koon, for instance. Despite being hailed as the son of Punggol, he did not run again for Punggol East SMC in GE2015. Rather, he campaigned under the AMK GRC team instead, where it was arguably easier to gain admittance into Parliament as compared to campaigning alone in a SMC.

It is therefore my opinion that the concept of GRCs should be relooked at and perhaps amended to be more democratic.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
516,20,fkjhrij,t1_fkjf7h2,"Funny how I look at those aspects as positives rather than negatives. Being able to divide and coalesce responsibilities where appropriate - that’s the strength of group representation. Obviously some tasks are better tackled individually, and some tasks are better tackled collectively. That’s efficiency and we’re bloody efficient if nothing else.

The GRC system being able to bring in high potential but low experience representatives is also a fantastic strength. That’s how we groom young executives in large corporations - bring them into a team to work on big projects they otherwise could never get exposure to on their own, get them to learn from experienced mentors, and eventually fulfill their potential. It’s a fantastic system, compared to young hopefuls being thrust into SMCs with no experience or guidance. Again, it’s efficient, proven and similar to methods employed by tons of extremely successful organizations.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
517,20,fkjj7sp,t1_fkjhrij,"And herein lies the rub. The system benefits incumbents greatly, while simultaneously raising the bar for any team willing to mount a challenge. No offense, but the way you're looking at it reminds me of the mindset of a business executive. Sure, what you're proposing is great from an organisational standpoint, but from a democratic point of view, it is deeply flawed. If we're truly about electing the best team for the job, why is there a huge divide in requirements for both sides? Sure, one could argue that the incoming party would have to prove themselves first and that some measure of safeguards have to be in place. But the current playing field is so skewed that it might as well be a one-sided game of chess.

And last I checked, we're still a democracy, not a one-party centralised dictatorship like China.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020

> SINGAPORE - A 6-year-old girl was found dead at the ground floor of an Ang Mo Kio Housing Board flat on Tuesday (June 4).

> She is believed to have fallen from height.

> The police said that they were alerted to a case of unnatural death at Block 637 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 at 5.38pm.

> A girl was found lying motionless at the foot of the block and was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene.

> Chinese-language evening daily Lianhe Wanbao reported that the girl had fallen from the 11th storey.

> Police are investigating the incident.

> Ms Letecia, a domestic helper who works at an opposite block, told Wanbao that at around 3pm, she saw a girl standing at the kitchen window shouting: ""Daddy, daddy!""

> The 53-year-old said that the girl was crying for about 10 minutes before moving away from the window.

> About an hour later, the girl appeared again at the window crying loudly for her father, said Ms Letecia.

> The cries were heard again after 5pm when she was cooking dinner but this time she also heard a loud sound, and the cries suddenly stopped, added the domestic helper.

> When she looked out of the window, the girl was lying motionless on the ground.

> Wanbao reported that around 6pm, a woman who looked to be in her 50s appeared at the scene and starting crying.

Only to change her tune a couple months after that confrontation, when she saw two of my cousins leaning precariously over the window's edge.

Fortunately, both my cousins are safe, but the same can't be said for the young girl in this article.

*So in the past when we say, let’s design something for one in a hundred years, one in 50 years, we are beginning to see that hey, you know, this so called one in a hundred years is happening twice during the hundred years, so obviously things have changed.*

*And indeed, the Ang Mo Kio anti-escalator smoking system was designed for one in a hundred years. So our study, which is still ongoing, is ‘are you sure that’s adequate?’ But for the incident that happened on February 5, it is much more than adequate, nothing to do with these extremes of people traffic. It is just poor maintenance.*

*So as I said, this study is ongoing, but as a result of that study, as part of that study, they have gone into looking at current maintenance, and in fact, at a joint LTA-SMRT meeting on January 29, which is just a few weeks ago, among other things, they discussed and decided we need to replace the motor in the escalator.*

*So we are late by a few days. Had they proceeded to replace, this thing might not have happened.*

*But I suppose, that is life.*",t3_7vcmu9,05-02-2018

> SINGAPORE - A former general manager and secretary of Ang Mo Kio Town Council (AMKTC) who allegedly took bribes from two building firms and their director was on Wednesday (March 14) charged with corruption.

> Wong Chee Meng, 58, who is also known as Victor Wong, faces 55 counts of corruptly accepting gratification worth about $107,000 in total from the director of 19-ANC Enterprise and 19-NS2 Enterprise, in exchange for advancing the business interests of the firms with the town council, according to court documents.

> These bribes included overseas remittances to his mistress in China, a job for his daughter-in-law, entertainment expenses at KTV lounges, a $13,500 discount on the purchase price of a car and the use of a mobile phone line.

> The alleged offences took place between December 2014 and September 2016.

> His alleged co-conspirator, Chia Sin Lan, 62, a director and shareholder of 19-ANC Enterprise and 19-NS2 Enterprise, is accused of 54 counts of corruptly giving gratification and one count of abetment by conspiring with 19-ANC&apos;s project director Yip Fong Yin to corruptly give Wong the $13,500 car purchase discount in December 2014.

> Chia&apos;s companies also each face one charge of conspiring to corruptly give Wong gratification to advance their business interests with the town council.According to the Building and Construction Authority directory, both firms are licensed builders, and are also registered to carry out repair and redecoration works.

> Wong, who worked for CPG Facilities Management, the managing agent of the town council, was removed from duty after the town council received a complaint about him in September 2016 about ""the way he handles contracts and dealings in the town council"".

> He was later investigated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).

> The town council [appointed a new general manager](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-gm-for-ang-mo-kio-town-council), Mr Ang Boon Peng, in April last year - about five months after Wong was removed. The general manager is the most senior executive in the town council, similar to a chief executive in a private company.

> Wong and Chia intend to claim trial and are out on $100,000 bail each. Their passports have been impounded. Their case will be heard on April 11.

> If convicted, they each could be fined up to $100,000 and jailed for up to seven years, or both, on each charge.

> The companies could also be each fined up to $100,000 under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

> In a statement, the CPIB said that Singapore adopts a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The bureau ""takes a serious view of any corrupt practices and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.""

796,20,eqtlrvv,t3_bzmpyo,"I have my reasons to believe it's a domesticated cat and not a stray, mainly


1. We live on the 7th floor. 


2. It tried to get into the house through the window


3. It has a collar


Right now it's hiding under our neighbor's shoe cabinet, I tried feeding it some cat treats that I (secretly) brought but it only ate a little. It's very likely one of the neighbors' but if you think it's yours, pm/dm me asap since I can't be here for too long






Edit1: It has come out and right now it's uhhhh rubbing itself on my leg, and it's purring. I checked the collar, it's just a pink collar with feathers of multiple colors but there's nothing in there about the home of the cat



Edit 2: I got to go now, so I left a can of cat food and a container of water plus a box for the cat, hopes either the owners finds it or it stays safe until the posters are printed


Edit3: so about an hour later I came back to do a last check on the cat, but when I arrived the packet of cat treat was squished and the contents were on the floor, and the cat was gone. I'm hoping it was just a kind person using the stairs, since the container of water, can of cat food and box were left untouched. The cat only ate a bit of the cat food, so I'm worried about it since it was here last night when it rained. Stay safe, kitty!


Edit4: Just received word from my parents that the cat is from one of the neighbors upstairs, seems like the surroundings outside of our house looked similar to the neighbor's and the cat got mistaken. The neighbor took back the cat while I was away, so by the time I came back the cat was already with its owner",t3_bzmpyo,12-06-2019

> The incessant downpour on the first day of 2021 resulted in some flash floods in Singapore.

> Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park was one of the places flooded, with muddy rainwater alarming some members of the public.

> Here's how it looked on Jan. 1 afternoon:

> The Straits Times also posted a video of flooding in the park:

> However, unlike other areas, the flooding at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is not much of a cause for concern.

> Transformation of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park

> The naturalised river or streams and its adjacent areas that you see during dry days in the park were specifically intended to become floodplains during extreme wet days.

> The 3.2km meandering naturalised river at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park used to be a 2.7km long straight concrete Kallang channel in the past, which would not otherwise have been able to contain as much rainwater as it now does.

> This was what it looked like previously:

> Here's what it looks like now:

> Designed to be flooded during extreme wet weather

> This redevelopment of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park was part of the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme, a joint collaboration between PUB and NParks, which fulfilled two purposes, namely:

> - to create more recreational spaces for us, as well as more importantly,

> - to increase the capacity of the Kallang channel along the edge of the park.

> The river channel was redesigned to resemble a floodplain that connects to a network of drains in town.

> The usual volume of water will form only a narrow stream in the middle of the river while the adjacent area doubles up as a conveyance channel to dissipate large amounts of rainwater downstream in the event of a storm.

> After the redevelopment, the naturalised river's carrying capacity increased by 40 per cent, with an increase in length from 2.7km to 3.2km, as well as an increase in width by almost five times.

> These bio-engineering techniques also created habitats for wildlife to return, contributing to a 30 per cent increase in biodiversity that we enjoy today.

> This, of course, includes the Marina otter family we occasionally see, as well as many beautiful dragonflies, and more.

> The new park was designed by a German landscape architectural firm Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl (previously known as Atelier Dreiseitl) in 2007, and was built between 2009 and 2012.

> Here's a cool time-lapse video of the transformation of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park:

Addition edit :
Its not recommended for a merchant to refund to a cardholder without consent. Refunds are used for very specific purposes. E.g. return of goods.

Plus what occured here might be a processing related error, which may require further investigation. E.g. where the error actually occured. Reversals can be used to correct this.

> SINGAPORE — A former general manager and secretary of Ang Mo Kio Town Council who was sentenced to 27 months’ jail for taking tens of thousands of dollars in bribes from a contractor on Thursday (16 July) had his jail term increased to 39 months at the High Court.

> Along with the jail term, Victor Wong Chee Meng had been given a financial penalty of $23,398.09 as disgorgement for the financial gratifications he had received. He was sentenced at the State Courts in November last year.

> Both the prosecution and Wong appealed against the sentence.

> The 59-year-old had pleaded guilty in March last year to three counts of receiving tens of thousands of dollars in bribes over a period of two years. These amounted to a $13,500 discount on a purchase of a car, about $27,800 in remittances to his mistress in China and $34,070.40 in entertainment expenses at various KTV lounges, restaurants, massage parlours and a hotel.

> Wong had faced 55 counts of graft for offences committed between December 2014 and September 2016.

> He took the kickbacks from Omar Chia Sin Lan, 62, the director and major shareholder of two firms, whose core business was the carrying out of works for town councils. Chia’s two companies, 19-ANC Enterprise and 19-NS2 Enterprise, were awarded tenders and contracts by AMKTC worth millions of dollars during the period that Wong accepted the bribes.

> On Thursday (16 July), Chia also had his jail term increased from 21 months to 33 months. He had also faced 55 counts of graft and pleaded guilty shortly after Wong threw in the towel.

> Two charges of a similar nature, involving Chia finding employment for Wong’s daughter-in-law as well as the use of a free mobile phone line and free phone, had been taken into consideration for the duo’s sentencing.

> The 55 counts faced by Wong and Chia were amalgamated. The total amount involved for all the charges against the duo was $86,141.49.

> The prosecution had earlier sought a jail term of at least four years and eight months for Wong, as well as a financial penalty of $23,398.09. It also asked for four years and two months’ jail for Chia.

> Both men, who began serving their jail terms in November last year, appeared before Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon on Thursday via teleconference.

> Wong had initiated the graft by asking Chia for a discount on the car and to provide financial assistance to his mistress. Chia had given the gratifications with the purpose of advancing his companies’ business interests, as Wong’s position had given him the perceived ability to grant favours to contractors

> Wong had allowed himself to be cultivated by the contractor and his corrupt acts were particularly reprehensible, as he had reminded his staff of the need to remain corruption-free in an email on 7 January 2015, said District Judge John Ng, who heard the case at the State Courts.

> Wong “acted hypocritically” and “committed a grave mistake by succumbing to corruption and falling from grace,” the judge said.

> DJ Ng also imposed a fine of $75,000 each on 19-ANC Enterprise and 19-NS2 Enterprise, an amount based on factors such as the gratification given, the size and reach of the company and the number of people caught in the web of corruption.

> He also agreed with the defence that the contracts awarded to the companies were obtained in open tender, and not as a direct result of Wong’s intervention.

> In December 2016, media reports said that Wong was being investigated by anti-graft investigators. Wong, who worked for CPG Facilities Management – AMKTC’s managing agent – was asked to go on leave following a complaint filed against him in September 2016. He was removed from his positions at the town council in November that year.

> SINGAPORE: A three-year-old boy who was found dead at the foot of a block in Ang Mo Kio in February had been left alone in the seventh-floor flat, a coroner found on Tuesday (Aug 18), reiterating her advice against such a practice.

> The boy was living with his grandparents at a block in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, as his father was frequently in jail and his mother had lived apart from the family about a year after he was born.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The toddler was usually cared for by his grandfather while his grandmother worked as a stall assistant in the coffee shop downstairs.

> However at that time, the boy's grandfather was overseas for work. On the morning of Feb 18, the boy would not rouse from his sleep, so his grandmother decided to leave him at home while she went to work, expecting him to continue sleeping.

> This was the first time she had done so, as she previously would take the boy with her to work if her husband was away, saying that the boy was afraid of the dark if left home alone.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> On the day of the incident, the woman intended to return home at 7am after opening the stall at 5.30am. Her colleague would have already reported for work. She planned to take her grandson to a childcare centre at 8am before returning to the stall.

> She left him at home with the main door shut but unlocked. The main gate was also unlocked, with only a padlock hooked onto it.

> The window in the master bedroom had no grilles installed on it and was shut as the air-conditioning was on, but the window was old and could be opened easily.

> About an hour after the grandmother left for work, a neighbour heard a loud thud while preparing breakfast in her kitchen.

> She looked out of the window and saw the boy lying motionless at the foot of the block and immediately notified the police.

> Police officers found the boy lying in a pool of blood on a concrete pathway with his slippers nearby. Paramedics pronounced him dead that morning.

> The cause of death was found to be from multiple injuries sustained in a fall from height.

> Imprints found on an air-con ledge outside his flat window matched the boy's slippers.

> GRANDMOTHER DOTED ON THE BOY

> His grandmother said she doted on him and was shocked to learn of his fall. She regrets leaving him at home and is learning to cope with the loss.

> She said her grandson was a very active boy who would run around the house, climb up on the sofa and jump around.

> While she had observed that her grandson liked to stand on the bed in the master bedroom to look out of the window, she said she had never seen him open the window or lean against it.

> She and her husband had previously warned the boy that it was dangerous to go near the window, which was next to the bed.

> State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam said the boy's death was a tragic misadventure. He had likely woken up and found himself alone, she said.

> As he was afraid of the dark, he must have decided to look for his grandmother and put on his slippers and opened the window, climbing onto the air-con ledge before falling.

> The boy's death ""clearly illustrates the potential harm of leaving a young child alone at home"", said the coroner.

> ""Young children are known to be impulsive and unpredictable. They lack the cognitive maturity to appreciate the consequences of their actions,"" she said.

> This was not an isolated incident, said the coroner, listing several other cases where young children had fallen to their deaths when left alone.

> In January last year, a five-year-old boy fell from the window of an eighth-floor office after waking up alone, she said.

> In June last year, a six-year-old girl fell to her death from a flat on the 11th floor after her mother left her alone at home for almost six hours.

> ""As a rule, a young child should not be left alone at home. The potential for grave harm is enormous,"" said the coroner, conveying her condolences to the family of the boy.

If it is to recover cost, 50 cents does seem to be too much.

> This is likely the first time a five-room unit in the area has crossed the million mark.

> This is the second HDB unit in Ang Mo Kio town sold above S$1 million.

> The said unit was sold by Derek Yap who is both the homeowner and property agent of this transaction, according to Shin Min Daily News.

> It took him about half a year to seek buyers amid Covid-19. More than 10 interested buyers have viewed the unit before a willing one that offered this price.

> The unit is located on a high floor, between 25th and 27th storey.

> Teck Ghee Vista was completed in 2011 and the unit has a remaining lease of 90 years and 11 months.

> Yap listed three reasons why the unit garnered such a high price:

> An unblocked view that overlooks Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park Teck Ghee MRT station of the Cross Island Line will be nearby in the future The floor area of this unit is 121 sqm, which is bigger than the current BTO 5-room units (an area of 110 sqm).

> SINGAPORE — A postman who threw away mail belonging to residents has been found to have special needs, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) said on Tuesday (May 21).

> In January this year, photos posted on social media showed unopened letters belonging to residents in Ang Mo Kio in a rubbish bin.

> Singapore Post (SingPost) said it referred the case to the police, and a 29-year-old postman was subsequently arrested.

> IMDA said on Tuesday that it has completed its investigations into the case and found the postman in breach of the Postal Services Act.

> “In the course of its investigations, IMDA found that the postman involved is an individual with special needs and has expressed remorse for his actions,” it said, adding that the postman was “fully cooperative” during the investigations.

> “In view of the facts and circumstances, IMDA decided to issue an advisory to the postman.”

> A stern warning was issued to SingPost given that mail integrity and security had been compromised in the incident, IMDA said.

> CNA has approached SingPost for comment. CNA

It is actually quite easy to not detect personality issues that have strong correlation with low IQ - it does not require average intelligence to drive a bike, just training, for example.   A quick Google search will reveal many people holding down supervised jobs with IQs of between 70 and 80.

Hiring a mailman (I imagine) is simply evaluating if the person can get from point A to B and put the correct mail in the correct slot.  However, low IQ is also associated with personality issues that aren’t easy to detect in an interview setting.

The issue isn’t the “special needs”, it’s the “personality disorder”.  Mailmen don’t need to be geniuses, they just need to be responsible.

> He also shouts: ""You used force! I saw since just now. You used force!""

> Two police officers try to calm him down, but he continues shouting.

> At the 2:36 minute mark, a policeman says to the woman in Mandarin: ""We are here to help you.""

But it does seem like some civic education is needed here, because it seems like a fair number of Singaporeans don't know what police can or cannot do under the law. Previous news stories and reactions to them seem to support this idea.

Then maybe we can cut down on the number of sinkies who suddenly become self-professed experts in what the police can and cannot do whenever they spot any in action. The legendary patience they must have to deal with the bullshit.

My understanding is that for regular patrols and call downs, they always move in pairs for safety reasons. The TRANSCOM staff always move in larger groups right? 

Another example from yesterday:

Came back home after work and my mum told me there was an incident at our void deck about a glue sniffer. Showed me the photos she took of that afternoon. 5 officers surrounding one man lying on the ground. 

Lying on the ground because the sniffer’s brother apprehended him before they arrived. Hence, all drama and commotion like blood on the floor and a mask.

> SINGAPORE: A postman serving areas in Ang Mo Kio has been arrested after a resident said she found unopened mail in a rubbish bin.

> 

> Singapore Post (SingPost) said on Tuesday (Jan 29) it was investigating images circulating online of unopened letters, including some from government agencies, that an Ang Mo Kio resident said she found in a rubbish bin.

> Advertisement

> In an update later that day, the national postal agency confirmed that the postman has been arrested after it referred the case to the police.

> ""Following the findings from internal investigations, we have referred the case to the police,"" said SingPost in a statement. ""The postman serving the affected areas was arrested in relation to the case.""

> ""As police investigations are ongoing, we are unable to comment further, but would like to thank Facebook user Alyce Kathlyn for highlighting this case, and allowing us to look into this.""

> It also apologised ""unreservedly"" to residents of the affected blocks. They are: Blocks 175 to 182 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4, Block 611 Ang Mo Kio Ave 5, Blocks 612 to 615 Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 and Blocks 616 to 619 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10.

> The resident, who only wanted to be known as Mrs Loh, told Channel NewsAsia that she discovered around 30 to 40 unopened letters – some sent by the Land Transport Authority and the Community Health Assist Scheme – in a bin at Block 179 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 on Monday night.

> She uploaded photos of the letters she found on Facebook the same night. Her post has since been shared more than 6,000 times.

> 

> The resident says she found around 30 to 40 letters inside the rubbish bin. (Photo: Facebook/Alyce Kathlyn)

> In response to queries from Channel NewsAsia earlier on Tuesday, the national postal agency said it dispatched a team on Monday night to search for the letters.

> ""SingPost is aware that images of letters allegedly discarded in a bin are circulating online. Based on the addresses on the letters, a team was immediately dispatched to comb the area overnight,"" it said in a statement that was also posted on its Facebook page.

> The team located the rubbish bin and proceeded to ""search every bin within the vicinity"", but did not find the letters, it said.

> ""Letter boxes were also opened to check if these letters had been delivered to affected recipients,"" SingPost added.

> Mrs Loh, who is known as Alyce Kathlyn on Facebook, said she removed the letters – which were addressed to residents of different units and blocks – from the rubbish bin. She placed them at the ""nearest letterbox, hoping neighbours could find their lost mail"".

> 

> Some of the letters that the resident says she found in the rubbish bin. (Photo: Facebook/Alyce Kathlyn)

> SingPost said that it was conducting interviews with the postman on duty and is trying to locate the letters so it could have them delivered to the intended recipients.

> ""Please bear with us as we continue to investigate this and will provide an update as soon as possible,"" it added.

> SingPost also reached out to Mrs Loh via the comment section of her post and apologised for the ""unpleasant experience"". It also assured her that it would ""get to the bottom of this"".

> Mrs Loh said she found the letters in the bin while searching for her missing parcel. She added that she has seen letters ""dumped twice within six months"" at the same block.

> Her neighbour, who also lives at Block 179, told Channel NewsAsia that he reported to SingPost last year about mail going missing. The civil servant, who asked to remain anonymous, said he has lived at the same block for nearly 30 years and only experienced issues with mail in the last year.

> In February 2018, a SingPost postman was fired after he was found to have thrown away returned letters and direct mail at a condominium.

> After a member of the public confronted the postman, he admitted to throwing the mail away and complained that he was tired and had been treated unfairly.

The postman gets one stack and is supposed to put one in every mailbox. Actually, I would be quite grateful if the postman just threw the stack away. But the company who paid SingPost would be unhappy.

Returned mail is most likely this: Let's say you receive a letter that was addressed to the previous tenant/owner of your home. You are supposed to strike off the address and write on the envelope that this person doesn't live here. Then out of all the mailboxes for the HDB block or condo, there's one box that is labeled returned mail. You're supposed to put that letter in there. Sounds like the postman just discarded everything in that box. And generally it doesn't hurt anyone because when Starhub or whoever gets the returned mail, they won't do anything.

> SINGAPORE: The Ang Mo Kio Town Council said on Monday (Sep 7) it is investigating the cause of a pipe choke after fecal matter overflowed at a void deck last week.

> A preliminary investigation showed that an “underground pipe was choked”, said the town council, causing fecal matter to spill at the void deck of Block 639 in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6.

> The incident first started last Thursday morning, a spokesperson from the Ang Mo Kio Town Council said in response to CNA’s queries.

> “The incident started with a resident who (gave) feedback that the water in his toilet was unable to flow down his gully trap,” the town council said, adding that the issue was rectified on Thursday itself.

> But the next morning, it was alerted to another incident with “an overflowing of fecal matter at the void deck”.

> In response, the town council cordoned off and cleaned up the area, the spokesperson said, noting that public safety and public health considerations were “paramount”.

> 

> “To prevent further recurrence, we have temporarily diverted the waste matters into the manhole.”

> 

> The exact cause of the choked pipe is still under investigation, the spokesperson added.

> 

> The town council said it will continue with inspection and rectification works on Monday together with the Home Improvement Programme contractor.

> 

> The affected block is currently under the Home Improvement Programme, which addresses common maintenance problems related to ageing flats.

> SINGAPORE - The swift action taken after a complaint was received about the former general manager and secretary of Ang Mo Kio Town Council (AMKTC) shows the ""essence of how the Government is run"", said Minister of Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam on Friday (Jan 6).

> ""Regardless of who and regardless of the fact that this is the general manager of Ang Mo Kio Town Council, if there is an allegation, it will be investigated and no one will be spared,"" he said.

> ""No town council, no one, nothing will be swept under the carpet. That is why Singapore is successful, because we take probity in public office very, very seriously.""

> Mr Shanmugam was asked about the case on the sidelines of a press conference to announce the results of a review of criminal investigation processes.

> Mr Victor Wong, who works for CPG Facilities Management, the managing agent of the town council, is under investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).

> He was asked to go on leave by his company after the town council received a complaint about him in September, town council chairman Ang Hin Kee told The Straits Times on Dec 29.

> Mr Ang had said that the complaint ""arose out of his dealings which relate to probable behaviour needing investigation done by CPIB"".

> Mr Shanmugam also contrasted the actions taken by AMKTC to the practices of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC), which had come under fire last year (2016) for lapses in governance by auditor KPMG.

> ""(In) the only place where this Government is not in charge ... you have people appointing their cronies to run the Town Council. You have the Town Councillors being misled about the terms on which the cronies were appointed,"" he said.

You call that good behaviour with public funds?""

> A 68-page report by KPMG on AHTC&apos;s accounts released in November last year (2016) revealed that payments totalling at least $23 million were approved by town council members with a conflict of interest.

> Improper payments totalling about $1.5 million were also identified.

> The Court of Appeal had ordered the town council managing the opposition wards of Aljunied GRC and Hougang single-seat ward to appoint a Big Four accounting firm to establish whether any past payments it made were improper, and ensure it complied with the laws.

> The report is part of an ongoing audit of AHTC following significant lapses in governance flagged by its own auditors as well as by the Auditor-General&apos;s Office (AGO) in a special report in February last year, which was debated in Parliament.

> The Worker&apos;s Party, in a media statement on Friday afternoon, advised against jumping to conclusions on the case.

> ""Since CPIB is investigating the AMKTC case, we should let due process take its course and not jump to conclusions,"" said the statement.

> ""Premature speculation, especially when done by influential people, may pervert the course of justice by shaping investigations. So let’s wait for the findings of the CPIB on the AMKTC case and let the law take its course,"" it added.

> SINGAPORE: The mastermind behind a S$119,000 daylight robbery of a jewellery shop in Ang Mo Kio was sentenced on Thursday (Nov 12) to three years and three months' jail and six strokes of the cane.

> M Jegatheesh, 28, admitted to plotting the scheme with two other men, choosing to target the shop at Block 574, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 as it looked old and its owners were elderly.

> Advertisement

> The court heard that Jegatheesh was a Gojek driver at the time of the offence. His co-accused, Veeramani Subran Das, was a Grab driver then, while the third accused, 32-year-old Sharavindran Suppiah, was unemployed.

> Jegatheesh planned to use his Honda Civic in the scheme along with a Toyota Vellfire belonging to Veeramani.

> On Aug 13, 2019, the three men met in Geylang, where Jegatheesh told the rest of his plan to rob the shop the next day.

> He targeted the place as it looked old and he thought it would not have any alarms installed. He also thought that the elderly owners would not be able to put up resistance.

> Advertisement

> Veeramani agreed to play the role of the getaway driver and to transport the gold to Sharavindran, who was asked to help sell it.

> At about 2.40pm on Aug 14, Veeramani drove the Toyota to the car park at Block 521, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, before Jegatheesh parked his car next to him.

> Veeramani then took over the wheel of the Honda, while Jegatheesh moved to the back seat and put on clothes including a long-sleeved shirt, a hoodie, gloves and a helmet.

> When Jegatheesh entered Hock Cheong Jade & Jewellery shop at 4.07pm, the co-owners, aged 70 and 75, were there.

> Advertisement

> Jegatheesh tried to pull down the roller shutter at the entrance, before shouting ""Don't move! Don't talk!"" and jumping over the jewellery display counter.

> The two co-owners pressed hidden alarm buttons to notify an external security company. They did not confront Jegatheesh as they feared for their safety.

> 

> Jegatheesh swept the jewellery, including gold necklaces, bracelets and pendants, into a duffel bag he brought with him.

> One of the co-owners asked Jegatheesh not to take so much jewellery, as he had a small shop, and shouted ""tolong tolong"" or help in Malay.

> A shopkeeper next door realised that the shop was being robbed and called the police.

> THE ESCAPE

> Once Jegatheesh had filled the bag with S$119,288 worth of jewellery, he jumped over the counter and fled to the Honda. Jegatheesh removed his robbery clothes and changed into another outfit before placing the used clothing into the duffel bag.

> He instructed Veeramani to drive off with the Toyota, which contained the duffel bag, to await further instructions, while Jegatheesh drove the Honda away.

> Veeramani kept some of the items for himself before handing the bag with the gold inside to Sharavindran. Sharavindran transferred the jewellery to a plastic bag and tried to get help to sell it but was unsuccessful, so he decided to safekeep the jewellery. Veeramani drove them both to Dakota Crescent, where there were abandoned HDB blocks.

> Sharavindran climbed to the sixth floor and placed the duffel bag with Jegatheesh's clothing inside a toilet of a unit, before placing the plastic bag containing the jewellery inside the cistern of a toilet bowl in another unit, securing it with black tape.

> Police at the scene of a robbery that took place at a jewellery store in Ang Mo Kio on Aug 14, 2019. (Photo: CNA reader)

> ​​​​​​​

> When the police raided Veeramani's home at 1.30am on Aug 16, he threw the jewellery he had taken for himself out of his window. The police later arrested the three men and managed to recover all the jewellery.

> Jegatheesh had been set for a trial but pleaded guilty on Thursday to one charge of conspiring to commit robbery, with two other charges taken into consideration.

> PROSECUTOR ASKS FOR HIGHER TERM THAN CO-ACCUSED

> The prosecutor asked for three years and six months' jail and six strokes of the cane as Jegatheesh was the mastermind of the offence.

> He said the robbery caused ""wide public alarm"", was committed by a group of people, and was elaborately planned and premeditated.

> Jegatheesh, who had no lawyer, said the prosecutor cited past cases that involved violence, threats or weapons, whereas he ""did not even threaten anyone"".

> ""I did not even say I want to kill anyone or kill the old man,"" he said. He added that the gold was recovered with his help, and said he had decided to plead guilty after ""deep consideration"" and ""deep thinking"".

> The driver of the getaway car, Veeramani, was sentenced earlier this month to three years' jail and six strokes of the cane for his role. The third accused, Sharavindran, will be sentenced at a later date.

> For robbery, Jegatheesh could have been jailed between two and 10 years and given at least six strokes of the cane.

> Mr Mohamad Fazir was in the living room, absorbed with his Nintendo Switch, when he was shocked out of his wits by an explosion in the kitchen.

> There was an e-scooter being charged in the kitchen at the time and very quickly, Mr Fazir, 30, noticed a fire had started.

> ""I didn't hear anything, then all of the sudden, there was an explosion. I could feel the heat of the explosion on my face,"" the car washer told The New Paper yesterday.

> His parents were out, along with two other siblings, but his younger brother was asleep in the two-room rental flat on the fourth storey of Block 224, Ang Mo Kio Ave 1, at the time of the explosion and the pair quickly fled the unit.

> The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a Facebook post yesterday that it had responded to a residential unit fire there at about 3pm.

> When the SCDF arrived, the fire was raging and involved the contents of the entire flat. It was extinguished with one water jet.

> SCDF officers rescued one woman and her four children from the next-door unit and around 60 people in all were evacuated.

> ""Preliminary investigations into the cause of the fire indicate it was from a personal mobility device (PMD) placed in the kitchen,"" SCDF said.

> This is the second fire involving PMDs in less than a week.

> While investigations are ongoing, it is suspected that a flat in Bukit Batok caught fire last Thursday also because of a PMD being charged.

> A 41-year-old man who was unconscious in the unit was rescued by SCDF firefighters but died two days later after suffering third-degree burns on 40 per cent of his body.

> Some residents who were evacuated yesterday told TNP that PMDs should not be charged in flats.

> The woman who was rescued with her four children from the unit next to the flat that caught fire, a housewife who wanted to be known only as Mrs Muhammad, felt it was not right.

> The 24-year-old, whose husband was at work at the time, said: ""It's not safe. It's so dangerous. PMD users should think about others.

> ""While I was trapped in my flat, I was worried my gas stove would explode because of the fire.""

> Mr Salim Embik, a driver in construction, agreed.

> The 63-year-old, also a fourth-storey neighbour, said: ""I don't feel safe. It's too dangerous to charge indoors. It'd be better to charge PMDs outdoors instead.""

> Fires caused by PMDs being charged in residential units are becoming more frequent as the devices become more popular.

> Last year, there were 74 such fires, a 51 per cent increase from the 49 incidents in 2017.

> The latest incident has resulted in Mr Fazir and his family being relocated to another flat.

> In a Facebook post yesterday, Ang Mo Kio Member of Parliment Koh Poh Koon said: ""Although no one was hurt, some families are affected as their homes were damaged. Temporary HDB units have been arranged for and are ready to accommodate them overnight.

> ""They are receiving support from agencies, community partners... and we hope to be able to help them through this difficult period.""

Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which in the United States is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Soviet response would often be ""What about..."" followed by an event in the Western world.The term ""whataboutery"" has been used in Britain and Ireland since the period of the Troubles (conflict) in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s or 1970s, while other historians state that during the Cold War, Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term. The tactic saw a resurgence in post-Soviet Russia, relating to human rights violations committed by, and criticisms of, the Russian government.

Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which in the United States is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Soviet response would often be ""What about..."" followed by an event in the Western world.The term ""whataboutery"" has been used in Britain and Ireland since the period of the Troubles (conflict) in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s or 1970s, while other historians state that during the Cold War, Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term. The tactic saw a resurgence in post-Soviet Russia, relating to human rights violations committed by, and criticisms of, the Russian government.

> SINGAPORE - The war on dengue has received a boost with the opening of a new facility in Ang Mo Kio that can breed millions of mosquitoes a week to prevent urban female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from producing offspring.

> The launch on Monday (Dec 2) comes at the tail end of a year in which Singapore has experienced its third-biggest dengue outbreak. As of Nov 21, more than 14,470 people here had been infected with the disease, with 20 lives lost.

> The new facility will allow the National Environment Agency (NEA) to scale up Project Wolbachia by producing up to five million mosquitoes a week.

> The project involves the release of male Wolbachia-Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to suppress the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito population, which is the primary vector of dengue, chikungunya and Zika here.

> When the released male Wolbachia-Aedes aegypti mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that do not carry Wolbachia, the resulting eggs do not hatch.

> The NEA said that over time, the continued release of male Wolbachia-Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is expected to bring about a gradual reduction in the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito population, and hence lower the risk of dengue transmission.

> Speaking at the launch of the new facility, Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor said: ""If we are serious about confronting climate change and other challenges, dengue control cannot simply be just 'business as usual'. We cannot just do more of the same.""

> Explaining the need for action, Dr Khor, who is also Senior Minister of State for Health, said the dengue situation is likely to worsen over the next few decades as a result of global warming.

> This is because higher temperatures result in mosquitoes breeding faster, and cause the dengue virus to replicate at a quicker rate.

> Related Story NEA to test releasing mosquitoes via drone as Project Wolbachia moves to phase 4 of fight against dengue

> Related Story Mosquito trials raise hopes of defeating dengue

> The new $5 million facility in Techplace II at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 is expected to provide scalability in the production and release of Wolbachia-Aedes aegypti mosquitoes needed for Project Wolbachia.

> NEA chief executive Tan Meng Dui said the facility's target capacity a week is a tenfold increase over that of the previous facility, which was located in Neythal Road and is now defunct.

> ""This facility and the technologies it houses will play a key role in Singapore's efforts to deploy Wolbachia technology as part of our integrated vector control programme to tackle these diseases (dengue, chikungunya and Zika),"" he added.

> The highly automated facility in Ang Mo Kio, which is thrice the size of the previous one, incorporates new technology and machines to boost production capacity and increase productivity, including a male-female pupae sorter, which was co-developed by NEA and local start-up Orinno Technology.

> The sorter is 10 to 20 times faster than the previous method used to separate the two types of pupae and larvae, and uses lighting, water-flow control and a specially designed sieve to achieve high accuracy and high efficiency in the separation process.

>

> 

> The facility also uses automated larvae and pupae counters.

> The NEA has also been working closely with the Joint Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to incorporate low-dose X-ray irradiation in the production process.

> This step causes any female Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes that are inadvertently released to become infertile, preventing any build-up of such mosquitoes, which would hamper Project Wolbachia's effectiveness.

> More devices, such as a high-throughput larvae-rearing system designed by FAO, IAEA and Orinno, are in the pipeline to further improve scalability for Project Wolbachia in future.

> Dr Khor said the impact of Project Wolbachia goes beyond the realm of public health.

> ""The innovative solutions developed and collaborations formed through this important scientific initiative have also advanced research and provided economic opportunities in Singapore,"" she added.

> SINGAPORE - The prosecution has called for a lengthy jail term and a fine for the former Ang Mo Kio town council (AMKTC) general manager who pleaded guilty to corruption in March this year.

> Stressing the need for a ""stiff deterrent sentence"", Deputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke-Yue on Wednesday (June 26) called for a jail term of at least four years and eight months for Wong Chee Meng, 59, along with a penalty of $23,400.

> Wong received over $86,000 in bribes between 2014 and 2016 from Chia Sin Lan, 63, the director of two construction companies that submitted bids for town council contracts.

> The prosecution also sought a jail term of at least four years and two months for Chia, along with a $100,000 fine for each of his two companies, 19-ANC Enterprise and 19-NS2 Enterprise.

> They will be back in court for sentencing on Aug 23.

> DPP Jiang told the court that Wong and Chia's actions caused a ""great deal of public disquiet"".

> ""This is because of its propensity to erode the belief and trust in town councils, public institutions which are entrusted by Parliament to administer public funds in an accountable manner,"" he said.

> He said that the power of a town council to award works to contractors has to be exercised according to established processes and procedures under the Town Council Act.

> Only then can it be ensured that the public funds held by town councils are properly administered.

> Related Story New code to strengthen town council governance

> Related Story Town council graft trial AMKTC ex-GM, businessman plead guilty

> Related Story Contracts worth millions awarded to firms when former Ang Mo Kio Town Council GM was allegedly bribed

> Citing a 2017 parliamentary debate, DPP Jiang said town councils now serve more than 3.2 million residents and manage over $1.6 billion worth of public and residents' monies.

> ""Given the sheer size of resources managed by town councils and the extent to which town councils impact upon the private lives of a majority of Singaporeans, absolute probity is demanded of all officers and employees of town councils.""

> From 2014 to 2016, Wong was treated to KTV sessions - including alcoholic drinks, tips for staff and flower garlands for lounge singers - by Chia, and also received bribes such as a $13,500 discount on a used car and financial transfers totalling close to $27,800 to his mistress in China.

> According to court documents, Wong, who worked for CPG Facilities Management, which was AMKTC's managing agent, had become ""beholden"" to Chia. In that period, 19-ANC and 19-NS2 were awarded tenders and contracts by AMKTC worth $9,874,650.

> In mitigation, Wong's lawyer Melanie Ho said her client has had an ""exemplary career and public service record"" of over three decades.

> She added that it was Wong's first brush with the law, and the offences were a one-off discretion due to difficulties in his personal life.

> Wong also never compromised his duty to AMKTC, and the town council did not suffer any harm, said Ms Ho.

> Hence, she asked the court for a sentence of between 11 and 14 months of jail, along with a penalty of $1,505 for Wong.

> Responding to the prosecution's argument that the case caused an ""erosion of trust of the Institution of Town Councils"", Ms Ho called it ""an exaggeration of the facts"".

> She argued that Wong was fundamentally a private sector employee who was deemed to be a public servant.

> SINGAPORE - A 54-year-old woman was charged on Monday (Oct 28) with the murder of a 63-year-old man, believed to be her husband.

> The incident took place in the early hours of Sunday and was the first of two murder cases that day.

> Appearing handcuffed and in a red polo T-shirt and dark shorts at the State Courts, Chinese national Wang Shuzhen was accused of killing Mr Teh Hock Pine some time between 5am and 6.02am.

> She will be back in court on Nov 18, following a three-week psychiatric assessment at Changi Prison. Police said they had responded to a case of unnatural death at Block 633 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 at 5.46am on Sunday.

> Mr Teh was pronounced dead by paramedics and Wang was arrested at the scene.

> While court papers did not state how Mr Teh was killed, Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao reported that he had been stabbed.

> Mr Teh was a former policeman.

> However, it is not known when he left the force.

> In 2000, he held the rank of senior staff sergeant and received the Long Service Medal at the National Day Awards that year, a list on the website of the Prime Minister's Office showed.

> When The Straits Times visited the scene at 9.30am on Sunday, a trail of bloody footprints was seen leading out from the third-floor unit into the common corridor.

> The area outside the unit as well as the staircase leading up to the flat had been cordoned off.

> According to housing records, the unit was owned by Mr Teh.

> A 60-year-old neighbour said he had heard repeated ""drum-like banging"" coming from the flat around 5am on Sunday.

> Neighbours also told ST that the couple had been living there for about two years.

> They were often seen going to the hawker centre together and were also seen pushing a stroller with a toddler around the estate.

> Lianhe Wanbao reported that the couple lived in the flat with their daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter.
