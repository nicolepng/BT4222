0,20,g45mprt,t3_in43ap,"Thanks for sharing this pic. This is where I grew up. Where I learn to ride my first bicycle. Behind this picture, before reaching the stairs, is an overhead bridge, my mother would take me and my bike to Bishan park. 

One time when we reach the stairs, I decided to go down the slope on the right that is mend for bicycle and not wait for my mother. I was so young and lost control of the bike, the bike and me went straight for the stairs. 

As you can see how long that flight of stairs are, by some miracle, I didn‚Äôt even roll down, like some unknown force just stop me, I roll down two steps and that‚Äôs all. My bike went all the way down and got totalled. 

That was the first time I remember seeing my mother crying. So I‚Äôm going to call my mother and tell her I love her now. Bye.",t3_in43ap,05-09-2020

The robot is then a platform for organisations to develop software on for their own use. Literally one of the main features is that it is a developer platform: https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot

If anything, the code would be produced by DSO, DSTA, or A*, depending on whether it is military. They're not spaghetti-code producing sweatshops. You're also overestimating the difficulty in coding a facial recognition database, for example. It's something I can knock up in a week, and I'm not even a software engineer. Actual software engineers can likely do a much better job. A lot of rather high performance computer vision stuff is open source or available in published papers.",t3_gg6ios,09-05-2020

That tells you a few things - their products are more usable than the usual lot, and they probably develop a lot of other software libraries they can provide in a black-boxed fashion to their clients.

Saying ""they don't do data analysis"" code, is a weak hypothesis in this case. They, most probably do the data analysis code, it's only a question of price and red tape whether they will provide it to a client.

Lastly, developing data a rudimentary identification library and associate identity database is a task a graduate student can do. Developing a library usable in the wild is what makes or breaks a product. Boston Dynamics has a history of delivering unique products, combining hardware and software.

I think seriously your issue is you just don't realise this technology has been here for a long time. A robot has nothing to do with it. There are many more companies out there that actually specialise in this; boston dynamics isn't one. Even if Boston dynamics did, as a profit-seeking enterprise they could easily provide their software for use without the accompanying robot.

You're getting hung up on a robot. The point is that cameras are cameras; robot or otherwise. The capabilities you're worried about exist in the wild and can be adopted by any developed country. You don't need a noisy robot to track someone when you can have much quieter and impossible to avoid cameras on every street.

The fact of the matter is that whether a city decides to adopt such capabilities en masse is largely opaque to the populace, and has nothing to do with whether there are a couple highly visible and noisy robots going around. The technology exists. It only needs cameras, which are everywhere, and some computing power in a datacentre somewhere.",t3_gg6ios,11-05-2020
326,20,fqgwaa6,t1_fqa9wsp,"Cameras are static, left in place for years, and calibrated for a definite focus length and field of view. That applies to the newer covert commercial surveillance screens as well - they may have many cameras, but those cameras are always pointed in one direction and have the same focus length.

A robot, equipped with cameras is none of those things. 

Additionally, private surveillance companies and commercial surveillance initiatives associating people's real life identities with their online profiles, have been present in the cities since, at the very least, 2010. 

That doesn't mean that indiscriminate surveillance is acceptable - it is absolutely not, nor that it prevents crime  - it doesn't - fungibility of previously ""luxury"" goods, like phones, video players does, as well as cheap food and open entertainment locations.",t3_gg6ios,13-05-2020

Of course, at the end of the day the design still looks nice, but when free passes are given out like this to foreign architects to grow their brand, then they‚Äôll sell the exact same idea to the next country that‚Äôll pay them for ‚Äúbrand‚Äù rather than design. Singapore always likes to build all these ‚Äúfirst‚Äù and ‚Äúlargest‚Äù kind of buildings to show off (for example Singapore flyer), but the moment china or any other country builds another similar one but 1m higher, then we‚Äôll just be a country with buildings that aren‚Äôt unique or the biggest. Moshe Safdie, who we‚Äôve given so much liberty to construct our entire tourist experience, has sold the exact same indoor waterfalls and boat rooftop structure span to china with no qualms as to how it would affect us.

Also, if you want to look at Architecture competitions, look at the current one on Founders memorial, and how the showcase before the selection was full of Foreign star architects names tied in with smaller singaporean firms (for foothold).

603,20,fi0321v,t1_fi031qa,"**No U-turn syndrome**

No U-Turn Syndrome (NUTS) is a term first coined by Singaporean entrepreneur Sim Wong Hoo to prominently describe the social behaviour of Singaporeans having a mindset of compliance to higher authorities before proceeding with any action. He makes a comparison of traffic rules in Singapore to those found overseas, to describe the phenomenon. In Singapore, drivers are not allowed to make a U-turn unless a sign specifically allows them to do so, while in some other countries drivers may make U-turns freely so long as a ""No U-turn"" sign is not present. Following that, this analogy is used to explain the red tape he has encountered with hard-nosed bureaucrats, which in turn stifles the very creativity that the Singaporean government has been trying to promote in the recent years.NUTS is also considered as one of the major criticisms of the rigid Singapore education system, where students are taught from a young age to obey instructions in an unquestioning manner, in a society where grades and paper certification are emphasised at the expense of some life skills.In 2003, the term was referred to by Singaporean MPs during discussions about encouraging entrepreneurship.

1020,20,gdn6yml,t1_gdn0y9k,"Yup! It's one of the invasive species of apple snail. There are [two of them recorded in Singapore](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/app/uploads/2017/06/2014nis031-047.pdf) and much of Asia, *Pomacea canaliculata* and *Pomacea maculata*. Both species look very similar and are very difficult to tell apart, and it's likely that they're hybridising. Previously, until genetic evidence showed that two species had been established in Asia, only a single species was thought to be present, *Pomacea canaliculata*, and they were all called Golden Apple Snails.

Both species of invasive apple snails are from South America, and they were introduced to Asia in the 20th century, likely via the aquarium trade and as stowaways of imports of aquatic plants. There were attempts to raise them for food, since they're edible and grow larger than many of the native Asian species of apple snail in the genus *Pila*. But these South American apple snails escaped, were accidentally transported, or were released when the aquaculture ventures failed, and so they're now all over the region. They're considered [a serious agricultural pest](https://blog.invasive-species.org/2018/09/14/invasive-snails-leave-a-trail-of-destruction/), especially in rice-growing areas, and devour aquatic plants in many important wetland habitats. In Singapore, they're probably responsible for the [decline and near-disappearance](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/app/uploads/2017/06/2013nis135-141.pdf) of the possibly indigenous apple snail *Pila scutata*.

These invasive apple snails are technically edible (which is why there were attempts to cultivate them in Asia for human consumption in the first place), but people who eat them need to be wary of parasites like the [rat lungworm](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3689487/), which can infect humans when raw or undercooked snails are eaten.

By the way, the eggs of these apple snails [contain a neurotoxin](https://www.proteinspotlight.org/back_issues/100/), which is why practically nothing eats them, and is probably one of the reasons they have become so invasive, since they produce so much young that will survive to hatching.",t3_k1b2or,26-11-2020

Relax, they're just snail eggs***](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/alien-invasion-relax-theyre-just-snail-eggs)*"" (FEBRUARY 18, 2014)*..""*SINGAPORE - Tens of thousands of alien-like pink eggs sprouted overnight on the banks of Whampoa River last weekend, much to the surprise of residents.*

*According to Chinese newspaper Lianhe Wanbao, residents woke up on Saturday to the never-before-seen sight of the canal walls blanketed with clusters of tiny, elongated blobs, which some have described as ""raspberries"".*

*Others fretted that the blobs would affect the water quality.*

*One expert interviewed by the paper identified the clusters as the eggs of a type of freshwater snail: the Pomacea canaliculata.*

*==>Also known as the* ***channeled apple snail or golden apple snail üçèüêåüëè***\*, the freshwater animal originated from South America.\*

*It is listed among the* [top 100 world's worst invasive alien species](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Invasives/Species/Channeled-Apple-Snail)*.*

*According to the Global Invasive Species Database, the snail was introduced to South-east Asia around 1980 as a food source, but later became a crop pest, particularly as it feeds on rice.*

*On average, each cluster has 200 to 300 eggs, although some clusters are known to contain up to 1,000 eggs.*

*The snails usually lay the eggs on solid surfaces up to about 50cm above the water surface. The eggs hatch in one to two weeks.*""",t3_k1b2or,26-11-2020

**[Aquatic Organisms Observed at Bishan Park](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2016-137-140.pdf) (S'pore Biodiversity Records - 30 Sep 2016)** -- PDF pg 2 (pg no. 137):
>> ""The identity of the ubiquitous apple snail in many water bodies in Singapore has been resolved by Ng et al (2016), and *Pomacea maculata* is noted from Bishan Park (Fig. 12)""""

*Pomacea maculata* wasn't at Bishan Park when the site was a concrete canal. I noticed gazillions of them appearing overnight, when PUB & NParks converted the canal to a naturalistic waterway -- literally by importing & installing tonnes of soil substrate & plants at the site starting from 2009/10.

I LOL'ed when they showcased the park's ""newfound biodiversity"" by showing photos of PM LHL at the waterway during the official opening, with numerous masses of toxic bright-pink egg-cases by his feet.

Also, as a result of PUB's *ABC Waters* programme, *P. maculata* (& other invasive species) became widespread across S'pore's urban freshwater sites. For instance, *P. maculata* started appearing in significant numbers at Pandan Reservoir in 2010, shortly after the reservoir edge (along West Coast Road) was ""ABC'ed"" with imported substrate & non-native plants. Before that, I'd NEVER seen this snail species there.

It was also in end 2010/11 that the chironomid (midge) population at Pandan Reservoir exploded to pestilence proportions. If you observe the marginal aquatic plants & ""floating wetlands"" (*reality-check*: rotting, sinking planted mats that require periodic replacements) between sunset & sunrise with a flashlight or camera flash, you would see swarms of chironomid emerging continuously & more or less exclusively from the ABC flora & organic substrates.",t3_k1b2or,27-11-2020

Short of a concerted effort to constantly search for and destroy every apple snail and egg mass maybe every week for several months, eradication at this point is simply impossible. I would say that some level of control or even complete removal is possible for say, smaller, shallow ponds. But not for the reservoirs or canals.

The worst part is even if they're absent or removed from some ponds, they can still show up and take over in a very short period of time, given that very young apple snails can easily hitchhike on aquatic plants as people transport them from one place to another.

There's an egg-laying tube, which is connected to various internal organs that are involved in egg production. It's not exactly the same as how it works in humans and other mammals.

* *Hand remove any adults and egg masses found. During the day, adults are typically submerged in water. At night, adults feed and lay eggs on exposed, dry vegetation.*
* *Crushing egg masses and adults is more effective than knocking egg masses into the water, which ultimately suffocates and kills the eggs.* 
* *Spraying egg masses with a powerful stream of water is an effective way to suppress egg masses, particularly those in areas hard to reach. A boat outfitted with sprayers is an ideal approach.* 

*Once a population has established in a new area, intensive hand removal and egg mass suppression efforts may be an effective means of control, but likely cannot remove the population entirely.""*",t3_k1b2or,26-11-2020

I'm not too keen on the whole floating wetlands either, although I have seen a variety of bird species using them. And I guess the explosion in midge populations was an unintended consequence. Interesting though that the Bedok Reservoir midges are a different species from the one at Pandan Reservoir, and their reproductive ecology is different; I don't recall Bedok Reservoir incorporating floating wetlands.


And yes, unfortunately, some of the PUB and NParks greening efforts have inadvertently benefited invasive species. Quite a bit of this greening incorporates non-native plants which can turn invasive - I've been seeing non-native pennyworts growing everywhere, and I wonder if their spread in some parks is linked to them being used in the floating wetlands.

1047,20,gduizt5,t1_gdrom8m,"I think you might be talking about members of the family Viviparidae, also often known as ""mystery snails""; there are a number of species that are native to Southeast Asia, but the ones present in Singapore are likely introduced, since they've only ever been found in manmade waterbodies like our reservoirs. Some of them should be plant-safe, I've kept [*Filopaludina sumatrensis*](https://singapore.biodiversity.online/species/A-Moll-Gastropoda-000394) in planted tanks without any visible damage - they seem to graze on algae, uneaten food, and detritus, but don't attack live plants,, but I can't guarantee that the other species found here, like [*Filopaludina martensi*](https://singapore.biodiversity.online/species/A-Moll-Gastropoda-000393) and [*Sinotaia guangdungensis*](https://singapore.biodiversity.online/species/A-Moll-Gastropoda-000400), are the same.

For other snails, I think the usual ramshorn and pond snails are generally alright with plants as long as the plants are healthy and thriving (I usually go for fast-growing stem plants), but can reproduce so quickly that they can become unsightly in the aquarium. Same goes for the Malaysian Trumpet Snail and its relatives - they don't damage plants, and I have a thriving population in some of my setups, but not everyone likes them.

As an aside, the Assassin Snail is [now established in Singapore](https://www.reabic.net/journals/bir/2016/3/BIR_2016_Ng_etal2.pdf), likely through escapees from the pet trade.

Bivalves like clams and musself are another component of the freshwater ecosystem that is not native to Singapore. Freshwater clams (*Corbicula* sp.) have become established in some areas, but because they're often buried in the mud at the bottom, I think it's still a lot easier to wait for them to show up in the aquarium shops. The Chinese Pond Mussel (*Sinanodonta woodiana*) is widespread and easily found, but I think it's only suitable for larger setups, and definitely out of the question for a nano tank.

By the way, the Science Centre guidebook series includes A Guide to Snails and other Non-marine Molluscs of Singapore. It covers most of the freshwater molluscs known to occur in Singapore, so if you need help identifying some of the snails you encounter in the reservoirs and drains, this is one of the most important resources.

We've got native freshwater shrimps in some of our reservoirs and ponds (likely *Caridina johnsoni*), but they're not colourful (usually transparent or slightly brown), and depending on what species you already have in your setup, there might be a risk of hybridisation.",t3_k1b2or,28-11-2020

The midges you encountered are biters ? What are the symptoms ? Where's the location -- near freshwater habitat, tidal area, or terrestrial site with lots of plants ?

Since the species in the Chironomidae family responsible for infestations at some of S'pore's urban reservoirs are supposed to be non-biting, could it be that:

- You are allergic to midges, such that any physical contact with them causes itching/ pain/ redness/ rashes ?

- You encountered sandflies (Psychodidae) or biting gnats instead ?

There are of course biting midges, but they come from the [Ceratopogonidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratopogonidae) family, which has thousands of species.   

https://extension.entm.purdue.edu/publichealth/insects/bitingmidge.html  
https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/biting-midges-and-their-control

Some biting Ceratopogonidae can be found in S'pore, & their habitats include [tree-holes, seepage spots with lots of organic debris, algae-covered soil](https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/149070), & even [bamboo internodes](https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/149060). It is possible that you might have encountered these, instead of Chironomidae.

&nbsp;

> ""Off!"" brand of DEET-based insect repellents (found in Guardian/Fairprice, etc) = ok-ish, but presumably the stuff that NS-men get for jungle = more hard-core?

The [SAF Enprotec Insect Repellent Spray](https://black-tactical.com/products/saf-enprotec-insect-repellent-spray-deet) ? This has 75% DEET -- which purportedly protects for 12-24 hours, as long as the applied surface remains dry. If you perspire, you may have to reapply the spray sooner.

The DEET concentration is just an indication of *how long the protection lasts* -- & not how ""lethal"" (zero lethality, in fact) or ""repulsive"" it is to insect pests.

DEET-based repellent sprays for adults found in local retail pharmacies generally sport 15-25% DEET, which typically provide 3-6 hours of protection on dry skin before requiring a re-application. In S'pore's weather, I find that I have re-apply 25% DEET every 1.5-2 hours when walking leisurely in a forested environment.

However, do note that some people might be sensitive to very high DEET concentrations, & experience stinging or rashes. So 75-100% DEET is indeed ""hardcore"" (in the longer-lasting sense), but not necessarily better than 25% DEET. For adults, the best balance is not to go below 15% DEET.",t3_k1b2or,19-12-2020
1055,20,ggc224m,t1_gdukndw,"> Bedok Reservoir midges are a different species from the one at Pandan Reservoir, and their reproductive ecology is different; I don't recall Bedok Reservoir incorporating floating wetlands.

There are also new (ie. different) species of chironomids emerging at Pandan Reservoir over the recent 5 years -- due to periodic introductions of imported aquatic & marginal plants, as well as substrates to replace the regularly-dying flora & decaying organic substrates. Some of the newer midge species don't mind migrating to the nearby drains when Pandan Reservoir gets too crowded.

In any case, besides residents near infested ABC sites who realized what the culprit cause is, I understand that poor NEA -- who has been tasked with fogging away the chironomids daily, as well as manually scooping up the egg-cases -- had also specifically flagged the ABC flora issue to PUB.

But PUB appears to very stubborn. Afterall, PUB's ""expert opinion"" signages about the said ABC ""floating wetlands"" keep touting how these wetlands are supposed to attract the build-up of beneficial ""biofilm"" -- which happens to be the very same substrate (organic debris) that attracts invasive midges to lay their jelly-like egg-cases in. And the planted installations tend to accumulate a lot more ""biofilm"" than the purely-hardscape installations.

Also, after a handful of ""floating wetlands"" were introduced to Marina Reservoir, I also started seeing small swarms of chironomids there, where there were none previously. Fortunately, the ""floating wetlands"" there are very few in number, so the chironomid population isn't so high.

Another newly-emerged chironomid swarming hotspot is alongside the lit-up bridges over the re-engineered naturalistic Bishan River (another ABC Water site), which is overrun with imported & pest plant species (plus tonnes of imported substrates). Fortunately there too, the midge population appear to be controlled by natural predators (due to proximity to the Central Nature Reserve).

&nbsp;

> but PUB still seems to be focusing on plants that can grow in urban areas, regardless of whether they're indigenous or not.

PUB's plant selection & horticultural style are reminiscent of Parks & Recreation Dept (NParks' predecessor) & NParks in the 1980s-2000s. Not so much whether the plants can grow (well) in a urban setting, but more of whether they ""look nice"" & are easily available. A lot of PUB's plants at ABC sites are either infested with insect/fungal pests &/or dying from unsuitable conditions -- & are regularly replaced like they are disposable consumables.

NParks' recent style (since the mid 2000s) is more focussed on ""exotic"" & ""unusual"" (read: what's the newest trend at the moment), although a minority are advocating for greater usage of native species. However, due to extensive species loss in S'pore, even the overwhelmingly majority of ""native plant species"" are non-indigenous stock routinely imported from Malaysia, Thailand & Indonesia. Such a practice also heightens the risk of inadventently importing invasive non-native flora & fauna species along with the ""native"" cargo.

&nbsp;

> some of the PUB and NParks greening efforts have inadvertently benefited invasive species.

That brings to mind another very prominent invasive fauna introduced by NParks since 2006 -- 2 species of tractor millipedes: *Anoplodesmus saussurii* & the similar-looking *Chondromorpha xanthotricha*.

I first saw large swarms of these in soil & compost substrates since mid-2006 in NParks-managed parks -- starting with the new HortPark & Sengkang Riverside Park (then called Sengkang Fruit Tree Park, before the concept was abandoned due to lack of suitable soil substrates to sustain commercial-type fruit trees). And by 2011/12, *Anoplodesmus saussurii* has become the most common millipede species across S'pore.

Kids visiting urban parks tend to get excited about such black-&-yellow millipedes, but I wonder if this is only millipede they would ever know, & think is native -- just like how many people think the Javan Mynah is native.",t3_k1b2or,19-12-2020

Oh yes I have bladder snails and mini ramshorns in my shrimp tank right now. Got some regular ramshorns quite some time back but they didn't survive. Think my water was too soft and/or the temperature was too high (~29¬∞C) at that time. Lol yep my tank only has stem plants, and they grow so fast that I have to trim them every week. Where did you get your trumpet snails? I couldn't find any in the aquarium shops in my area.

Yeah agree with you on the clams. Would definitely not want to dig around the mud to fish for them. Lol the Chinese Pond Mussels are way too big. I recently got some asian gold clams from an aquarium shop. They just buried themselves in the gravel and now I can't find them at all XD.

But once the snails grow beyond a certain size, they're probably immune to most predators. A small Estuarine Crocodile in a freshwater environment like Kranji Reservoir could theoretically munch on them (although I personally haven't heard of any eyewitness accounts), and [Long-tailed Macaques](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2016-090.pdf) living along the edges of the reservoirs are known to eat the snails.

It's always possible that they'll establish a new regular migration path, or maybe even spread down Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, and become resident breeders here one day.

So me and the other people crash onto the daughter which lucky the force manage to free her or else will the daughter will be crash underneath.
Second time at sengkang mrt also downwards escalator lady long dress got stuck at the landing , so she and the guy she with stand at the landing trying to yank the dress out at a downwards going escalator at peak hour crowd. So had to push past them to press the button.

So please know that the red button is at the top and bottom landing of the escalator underneath the handrails and longer escalator will have 1 in the middle of the escalator.

edit - to add, this effect was a lot less pronounced as the DTL began operations. People are getting used to new lines opening and are more attuned to exploring how each new line might make their commute shorter or otherwise more pleasant.

Always keep an eye open for an escape route. The best designed units (even with a suicide drop on the left) often have a landing strip on the right that you could potentially climb onto and then ride the downwards unit.

* [The Smooth-Coated Otter *Lutrogale perspicillata* (Mammalia: Mustelidae) in Singapore: Establishment and Expansion in Natural and Semi-Urban Environments](https://www.iucnosgbull.org/Volume33/Theng_Sivasothil_2016.html)

So far, the increase in the otter population has been seen as a good thing for our aquatic ecosystems. They're often touted by the authorities and the media (both local and international) as an example of how Singapore has done the right things, cleaning up the waterways and allowing wildlife to flourish in urban environments. I mean, nobody, not even our most experienced biologists and conservationists, expected otters to adapt to living in the city.

As for their impact on the ecosystem, otters appear to target whatever fishes or crustaceans are most abundant and easiest to catch. In Singapore, a large proportion of these are fish species that are not native and thrive in our reservoirs or waterways, or those that are abundant partly because of escapees from offshore fish farms. The otters don't hunt in the forest streams and freshwater swamp forest of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, which is where most of our threatened native aquatic fauna resides. They're just one of several fish-eating predators that have adapted to urban ecosystems thanks to the abundance of non-native fishes.

Regarding their numbers here, the current total population of Smooth-coated Otters in Singapore is estimated to be around 90 indivduals, and the numbers do not seem to be increasing that much compared to a few years ago.

Among the otter families, deaths and disappearances take place all the time, and while we don't know whether predators take a heavy toll on pups, it seems to be the norm for every litter to suffer losses for various reasons. There have even been some families that lost entire litters. Eyewitness accounts of territorial battles indicate that otters will not hesitate to fatally maul members of rival clans. Although some families have been able to raise several litters of pups, the population hasn't really grown all that much, especially now that most of the available territories appear to be occupied.

Their numbers will always be constrained by habitat and abundance of fish, as well as the presence of other families. We're always seeing the antics of a few highly visible, habituated families navigating urban areas, when there are many other families that live in more secluded parts of Singapore and mostly keep to themselves.",t3_gi9qbc,12-05-2020

1355,20,fqgb016,t1_fqdws0b,"Yeah the Botanic Gardens are hardly a natural setting though.

You're talking about a bunch of large fishes trapped in small waterbodies, without much aquatic vegetation or hiding places. And koi have been selectively bred for centuries to be much more conspicuous compared to their wild counterparts. No wonder they're such easy targets. A wild fish-eating animal would have to be stupid to not take advantage of this opportunity.

In the reservoirs and canals, the fishes have much more room to swim around and escape. Otters have to expend more energy hunting in these places, and after some time, the fishes become too dispersed and too challenging to catch, so the otters move on to another area in their territory. In the meantime, the fishes reproduce and replenish their numbers, so it's really unlikely that the otters will ever become so abundant that they wipe out their prey. Instead, the presence of predators like otters is a sign that the ecosystem is healthy enough to support the prey required for them to thrive.",t3_gi9qbc,13-05-2020

1399,20,e1b54tc,t3_8twi70,"I think when Bishan station was designed the Circle Line was not factored in. Same goes for stations on NSEWL networks.

The MRT, in its conception in the 80s, was more of an experiment because there were policymakers like Tony Tan who would rather an all-bus system than a rail-and-bus system of public transportation. The Toa Payoh-Bishan-Ang Mo Kio stretch was built to give us an idea of what are the engineering challenges and what would the adoption be like for an MRT system - remember this was before The Next Lap masterplan where the Circle Line was first mooted.  


I guess that is why the Downtown line interchanges have an entry-exit format, like Newton. Not only there wasn't enough space to build the downtown line stations above/under the existing station, it's a kind of crowd control for  commuters to switch between the two lines. My theory is that the ticket gates acts a natural battier for the flow of commuters from one line to another, unlike the Bishan station where the flow of passengers are further aggravated by escalators, etc. Maybe the powers that be learnt from the Circle Line and applied those lessons on the Downtown line.  


So I think what should have been done for Bishan interchange is to have a Newton kind of layout - people have to exit and enter the fare gates again instead of having a direct connection between two lines. You're right that Ang Mo Kio has a better design for crowd control - in fact, the middle track could have been there for a future line. I speculate that if the circle line has been overground it would have an interchange at Ang Mo Kio instead of Bishan, maybe? However, the alignment has to be changed and we would be talking about an alternate history of our MRT lines in Singapore.",t3_8twi70,26-06-2018

1406,20,e1bajrj,t3_8twi70,"I'm very surprised nobody has yelled for me yet. If it helps OP sleep better, I believe the guys who designed the station are now working in Malaysia.

>There are huge blocks of pillars everywhere on the platform itself. The capacity of the platform is drastically low compared to above-land stations. Queues cannot stretch longer than a few metres. During peak hours there is zero space to house people. Staff have to STOP people from entering the platform regularly because there is no more space to stand in the platform. Queues in the Circle Line link and the main entrance often stretch to more than 30 metres.

Are you referring to the northbound platform? Believe it or not, the entire platform is about the same size as other stations. There's a reason why they walled off the old southbound platform, where the Circle Line trains are.

(yes, nearly every other station is this size as well, with the exception of Queenstown, Buona Vista, Clementi, City Hall and Raffles Place).

The passageways to this platform, though, are a mess. And that's apparently because there isn't much support for the southbound track above, so they had to very carefully dig ~~with tiny shovels~~ out the transfer passageways. And the escalators/stairs are the way they are, because, again, they were built in the space of the old southbound platform.

>I'm referring to the NS line platform mainly. The escalators to the main exit is in the middle of the station, like all stations. This normally wouldn't be a problem. Except the escalator leading people in from the Circle Line is also in the middle! During peak hours there is a huge strain in the middle of the platform due to people from circle line and alighting passengers clashing with each other. They could have alleviated this by placing the escalators leading to CL at the two ends of the platform instead, like Paya Lebar station.

Well, there's no other place to put it. The north end of the old platform contains some plantrooms, and an access track to the depot is just past that. There's only barely enough space for one up escalator and one down escalator, and then we'd *still* be having this conversation because obviously 1up/1down isn't enough.

--

Here's how I'd fix it. I'd build an additional platform for northbound trains on the outside (Bishan Road) side of the station. Then have the old platform be used for boarding passengers, and the new platforms on the outside for transfers to the Circle Line. But alas, we make do with what we have :/

I've experienced the same thing at Outram Park station during evening rush hours several times as well. Problem isn't the linkway from NE line to EW line though, it's the fact that there is only ONE escalator for going up and a single staircase for going down. Even though there are two entry points into the EW line station, when there's too many people trying to enter the station from NE line it creates a HUGE congestion on both entry points as too many people are trying to squeeze onto a single escalator. End up the linkway gets jammed with snaking queues.

I reckon the crowds will only get worse when Outram Park station becomes a triple line station with the opening of Thomson line in a few years time...

The designers had to contend with the placement of the circle line platform and walkway with respect to the pre-existing NS line platform (both north-and south-bound). 


If you fix the NS line platforms, and the circle line exit that leads to the bus interchange, how would you configure the spacing in between? 


Bear in mind that the circle line track lanes have to follow an overall shape, so you can't change the position of them either. So, would you shift the circle line platforms to beyond the current exits (so that the placement is below the CC/starbucks, since there aren't underground developments there) or closer to the existing NS line/Junction8 mall. If the latter, would the crowd control solution from 15 years ago be to ask travellers to travel 200m toward the CC, take an escalator up and then backtrack 250m in the opposite direction in order to gain entry into Junction 8?


From right now, the year 2018, can you forecast stations bearing heavy crowd strains within the train network? Are you able to list out when and how an MRT station would fail to cope with crowds in the year 2033? You'd have to list the station and state the root cause to be at all relevant to the discussion. Another user mentioned Mini Metro. If you give it a try, you might notice that new stations and train lines will create an indirect stress on pre-existing train lines.


The NSL and EWL will bear the brunt of additional train network expansions because they serve so many commuters. Further expansions will place a greater strain on these two networks than the more recent lines. If engineers from the early 2000s had to consider all the permutations of failure at the inception of the project, work on the circle line would never have begun. Still, i don't think what you've raised should have been a problem for the engineers of that time to consider.


It might not be the protocol for SMRT, but a crowd control mechanism for Bishan circle line could be to empty out trains that approach Bishan (Marymount and Lorong Chuan) so that empty trains can ferry passengers at Bishan to other stations on the network. This would be in addition to stopping entry at the NSL and CCL entrances. Doing so would maintain the integrity of the system while enabling commutes to function. On the crowd control front, i don't think Bishan station would experience failure that would destabilise the whole network.


With the new condominiums that have sprung up around Bishan since 2003 (precisely because it was an interchange station), it would be harder for meaningful underground expansions to occur at that station to cater to the circle line crowds.",t3_8twi70,26-06-2018
1500,20,e1b7hbf,t1_e1b5h3w,"regarding why they did not choose Ang Mo Kio ... (what i think)

1. It is not a good choice for the circle line to go further north from Serangoon to AMK and back to Marymount area as it would add unnecessary travelling time for people living in, say, Serangoon (without any extra benefits to those on the NSL). Tighter curve radius is also another reason.

2. Going from Serangoon to Braddell to Caldecott would seem like a good choice, but the government probably wants to bring convenience to students studying at NYJC, RI and other schools (and the many people living in Lorong Chuan area as well). This means going through Lorong Chuan and Marymount, and Bishan so happens to be in between.

3. Going S‚Äôgoon > AMK > Upper Thomson > Marymount also seems like a good choice, but additional travelling time is one reason (as the circle line was meant to connect the existing lines, w/o people having to get to the CBD area to change, reducing the crowd in the CBD). Also, the LTA probably already had a rough idea of Thomson Line in mind, so it was unnecessary to go to Upper Thomson.

Anyw, kinda get your point cuz Bishan is rly overcrowded nowadays. 

Side note: Tampines was also v crowded previously that they had to stop the escalators during the evening peak hour because there was no space at all on the platform level. Sometimes had to wait 4 to 5 trains just to get to the front of the line and board. But with the DTL, it alleviated the crowd issue a lot (not just in Tampines, but the eastern section of EWL).

I was more insinuating that it is not possible for people to forecast future congestion problems. The more the train network expands to cater to passengers, the more fault lines in the system as a whole will be exposed.


Bishan is such a fault line. I'm of the opinion that Bishan's congestion is a symptom of the overly efficient train network. To avoid congestion in Bishan (given the geographical limitations and prior infrastructure as of 2003), they could either close down the circle line platform at Bishan (so Marymount and Lorong Chuan would be adjacent stations on the circle line) or they could have not expanded the network (meaning no DTL and expanded circle line).


Unless a person has had the foresight and has been publicly opposing the expansion of the train network (losing battle, this) since 2009, I can't take their current-day complaints seriously. That's probably too cynical of me though heh.",t3_8twi70,26-06-2018

> Two otter families have gotten into a territorial fight at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.

> Marina otters have often been caught clashing with their arch-rivals, the Bishan otters.

> However, it's not the Bishan otters this time, but the wandering Zouk family, which was recently also spotted at Little India.

> What happened?

> The Zouk family has been exploring the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park recently, beyond their usual haunt.

> An otter enthusiast, Jeff Tan, shared that May 10 was his first time seeing the seven Zouk otters visit the area.

> The curious critters did not bump into the Marina otters that day, even though they have intruded the latter's territory.

> However, two days later, Tan heard loud squeaks in the park on May 12 morning.

> The squeaks came from Marina otters, perhaps on high alert after sensing the presence of other otters.

> Swimming down the stream at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, the 10 Marina otters eventually found the seven Zouk otters near the McDonald's bridge.

> The 17 otters then got into a series of gang chant squeaking, warning the other to back off.

> The brazen Zouk otters were clearly not frightened despite being outnumbered by Marina otters, and the 17 otters got into a brawl in the bushes as the humans watched on from a distance.

> After the short tussle, the two otter families took a time out as they regrouped themselves, did a head count, and caught some rest before getting into more chases and gang chant squeaking.

> The Marina otters eventually let the Zouk otters off and went back to the waters.

> There were no casualties and no otters were caught by SPOT the safe distancing officer.

> You can watch the video here:

> Actress-turned-entreprenuer Jazreel Low has fallen victim to the lovable otters in Singapore.

> In a Facebook post on May 12, the 54-year-old revealed that the otters killed all the prized fishes in the pond at her spa.

> Since exiting showbiz, Low has set up several businesses, including Aramsa The Garden Spa at Bishan Park 2.

> Other ventures include yakitori restaurant ToriYard and Canopy Garden Dining, both of which are at Bishan Park as well.

> The predators were caught on camera, although not red-handed.

> In a separate post on the same day, Low paid tribute to her 13-year-old Arowana named Ah Huat, which was also eaten by the otters.

> When Singaporean comedian Hossan Leong expressed his shock that the otters would eat Ah Huat, Low replied: ""He [Ah Huat] survived floods and draughts but did not escape this massacre.""

> Leong then promised to scream at the otters on behalf of Low the next time he sees them.

> A photo of what is likely the same pond in happier times:

> Recently, a family of otters was also spotted at KK Women's & Children's Hospital, which is not too far from the spa.

> A fight had also broken out between the Zouk otters and Marina otters on May 12:

Smooth-coated Otters were possibly locally extinct or nearly so in Singapore for several decades, until one was seen at Sungei Buloh in 1990. After that, more otters started showing up, but for the most part, they kept to the mangroves, coastlines, and more secluded areas of the reservoirs in the north. Eventually, some of these otters managed to swim around Changi, since there were sightings along East Coast Park. A pair became established in Gardens by the Bay in 2013, and had their first litter in 2014 - this became the Marina family. In 2014, a lone male swam up Kallang River to Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, found a mate, and they too had pups, giving rise to the famous Bishan family. And so that was how the public discovered that otters were adapting to our urban areas, and now we're being inundated with videos and photos of the same few families, when there are more otters living in more secluded areas that tend to keep away from humans.",t3_gjh7cz,14-05-2020

1777,20,fqlgd55,t1_fql6kwh,"Coexistence really depends on a lot of things:

1) As far as I'm aware, the incidents where otters bit people are linked to people getting too close, especially when there were young pups around. A lot of people really don't know how to admire wildlife from a safe and respectful distance. So mitigating this really requires more public education on safe interactions with wildlife in general.

2) The authorities and experts can recommend certain measures that people with ornamental fish ponds or fish farms should implement so that they don't lose their fishes to otters, but we can't force people if they don't want to do so. This conflict will happen regardless of how many otters we have; as long as there's easy access to a source of food, wildlife will always take advantage. 

3) Public attitudes towards wildlife are also linked to how much the general public is willing to listen to those with knowledge and experience; unfortunately, based on my own experiences online, when it comes to living with wildlife, a lot of people (not just in Singapore) seem immune to facts and evidence.

4) Even if the authorities decide to start culling otters, it won't fix the issue - as long as the factors that attracted otters in the first place still exist, they'll keep coming back, especially since removing an otter would actually mean that a patch of formerly occupied territory is available again. And then we're back to square one. How do we decide how much culling is necessary or acceptable? Remember, the entire population in Singapore is believed to be around 90 individuals, and the species as a whole is considered globally threatened. We will also have to ask ourselves what's the point of culling. The biggest worry is that much like how the authorities dealt with conflict between humans and Long-tailed Macaques for so many years, it probably won't be for ecological reasons, but simply to mollify those who complain about wild animals.

5) In the end, how we manage otters will really depend on our attitudes towards native wildlife in general. Some people simply cannot accept sharing the landscape with other species, although these are usually a very small minority. Some people think that wildlife should be rounded up and confined in zoos, or even worse, killed, whenever they appear in urban areas. Most people are generally ambivalent, or have positive feelings about urban biodiversity. And to be honest, Smooth-coated Otters are ""easy"" to advocate for, compared to say, Long-tailed Macaques or Reticulated Pythons.

1833,20,dyhwn4e,t1_dyht5dn,"I don't know enough about Smooth-coated Otter reproductive ecology, but here are a few possible scenarios:

* A young lone male that has dispersed from another family comes across the Bishan family and the newly 'widowed' matriarch of the clan, manages to gain her acceptance, and pairs up with her. Or maybe this male pairs up with one of her adult daughters, to form the new breeding pair (or the other way around, lone female pairing up with one of her sons). Although I'm not sure whether the rest of the family will readily accept a new member of the clan, especially since if their dad was still alive, the entire family would have ganged up on the newcomer and mauled it to death.

* Bishan mum stays single, no more new pups are born, family eventually disbands (as the grown pups leave to look for mates of their own and start their own families), or worst case scenario, dies out.

* Bishan family gets displaced by another family that takes over their current territory, forcing them to find another area (much like how the Bishan family displaced the original Marina family and hunted them time and time again).

I need to ask the people at OtterWatch about updates regarding the Marina family, since that family had lost its dad last year.

UPDATE: Seems like the Marina family is now residing in Lower Peirce Reservoir, and is soemtimes seen in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. However, the matriarch is now apparently one of the young adult females from a previous litter; the original Marina mum is nowhere to be seen.

> Here's how it turned out.

> Upon entering, you'll notice numerous blue-coloured lighting illuminate the house, making it look pretty futuristic:

> The walls in the living area are white in colour, which perhaps add on to the sci-fi vibe.

As announced by the Ministry of Health (MOH) today, one of the new cases confirmed is a Year 1 student from Raffles Institution (RI) who has tested positive for COVID-19. He is linked to another confirmed case in his family. He became unwell on Friday, 21 February, and has been on medical leave and not been in school since.

2. In light of this, RI will be stepping up precautionary measures to protect its students and staff and prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures include:

1. Suspension of school for Year 1 to 6 tomorrow, Friday, 28 February, to conduct a thorough cleaning and disinfecting of the school premise. School will resume on Monday, 2 March 2020
2. Issuance of a 14-day Leave of Absence (LOA) for students, teachers and staff who had recently come into contact with the student. Contact tracing is on-going
3. Suspension of CCAs for Year 1 to 6 in RI for two weeks

3. These measures will provide another layer of protection for RI, in addition to the earlier precautionary measures that MOE had announced for the entire school system. These earlier whole-system measures will limit exposure to the school community in the event that a school staff or student gets infected. They include:

1. Suspension of large group and communal activities such as assemblies, camps and mass celebrations
2. Staggering of recess times in schools
3. Suspension of all external school activities, inter-school activities and Learning Journeys until the end of the March school holidays

#### MEASURES FOR MOE LANGUAGE CENTRE (BISHAN)

4. As the student had attended a language class on Thursday, 20 February, at MOE Language Centre (Bishan), classes will also be suspended for one day, on Friday, 28 February, to conduct a thorough cleaning and disinfecting of the school premise. Students, teachers and staff of the Language Centre who were in close contact with the student will be issued a 14-day LOA.

5. MOE will continue to monitor the situation closely, and work with students, parents and the community of the two institutions. We also urge all students and staff to continue practising good personal hygiene. This includes washing their hands frequently with soap, wearing a surgical mask if they have a cough or runny nose to prevent infecting others, and seeing a doctor if they are sick and returning to school only when fully recovered.",t3_fabxay,27-02-2020

> The incessant downpour on the first day of 2021 resulted in some flash floods in Singapore.

> Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park was one of the places flooded, with muddy rainwater alarming some members of the public.

> Here's how it looked on Jan. 1 afternoon:

> The Straits Times also posted a video of flooding in the park:

> However, unlike other areas, the flooding at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is not much of a cause for concern.

> Transformation of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park

> The naturalised river or streams and its adjacent areas that you see during dry days in the park were specifically intended to become floodplains during extreme wet days.

> The 3.2km meandering naturalised river at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park used to be a 2.7km long straight concrete Kallang channel in the past, which would not otherwise have been able to contain as much rainwater as it now does.

> This was what it looked like previously:

> Here's what it looks like now:

> Designed to be flooded during extreme wet weather

> This redevelopment of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park was part of the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme, a joint collaboration between PUB and NParks, which fulfilled two purposes, namely:

> - to create more recreational spaces for us, as well as more importantly,

> - to increase the capacity of the Kallang channel along the edge of the park.

> The river channel was redesigned to resemble a floodplain that connects to a network of drains in town.

> The usual volume of water will form only a narrow stream in the middle of the river while the adjacent area doubles up as a conveyance channel to dissipate large amounts of rainwater downstream in the event of a storm.

> After the redevelopment, the naturalised river's carrying capacity increased by 40 per cent, with an increase in length from 2.7km to 3.2km, as well as an increase in width by almost five times.

> These bio-engineering techniques also created habitats for wildlife to return, contributing to a 30 per cent increase in biodiversity that we enjoy today.

> This, of course, includes the Marina otter family we occasionally see, as well as many beautiful dragonflies, and more.

> The new park was designed by a German landscape architectural firm Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl (previously known as Atelier Dreiseitl) in 2007, and was built between 2009 and 2012.

> Here's a cool time-lapse video of the transformation of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park:

> SINGAPORE: An SMRT technical officer in a fatal workplace accident at Bishan Depot last year was hit by a rod that shot out of a machine he was operating, a coroner's court heard on Friday (Feb 26).

> Mr Muhammad Afiq Senawi, 30, was operating a hydraulic press machine in the rolling stock workshop ‚Äì where maintenance of trains and their components are carried out ‚Äì when the incident occurred, the court heard on the first day of an inquiry into his death.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The investigation officer in charge of the case testified that Mr Afiq had gone to work as normal on Mar 23, 2020, and was assigned to a particular work station with a buddy.

> At least two people were assigned to each station, which required the use of a hydraulic press machine to remove components from guiding rod arms, due to the weight of the guiding rod arm.

> Mr Afiq went to the work station first after the safety briefing ended that morning, but his buddy ‚Äì who was assigned with him to that station for the first time ‚Äì went off for a work-related discussion.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> When the buddy arrived at the work station, he did not check with Mr Afiq if he had done the safety checks, as he assumed Mr Afiq had completed them.

> They were tasked with removing and installing components on a pallet containing eight to 10 pieces of rod arms.

> They agreed to take turns, with one person operating the machine while the other acted as an assistant to guide or help place equipment.

> Mr Afiq's buddy went first, and the pair went through two guiding rod arms with no issue. When Mr Afiq began operating the machine on the third arm, his buddy said he wanted to help the way he normally did but Mr Afiq ""insisted he wanted to do (it) himself"".

> Advertisement

> His buddy stood aside to watch, but noticed that a pad was not aligned properly and asked Mr Afiq to remove the newly installed component as it was damaged.

> The buddy turned to check how many arms were left in the pallet, and turned back to see Mr Afiq placing components on the work station. He was unsure of what Mr Afiq was doing but did not think much of it as he thought Mr Afiq, who was his senior, would know what he was doing.

> When Mr Afiq pressed on the piston of the machine, his buddy asked him to stop as he noticed that the piston was moving very slowly and thought something was stuck or that something had gone wrong.

> Mr Afiq agreed and lifted up the piston slowly. At this point, the buddy said he looked away at the pallet again to check how many rod arms were left.

> BUDDY HEARD A LOUD BANG

> He heard the piston operating, followed by a loud ""bang"". He jumped backwards in shock and saw Mr Afiq falling backwards. He also saw various pieces of equipment scattered in the machine, and a hole in a hydraulic press fencing gate that was meant to keep people from reaching into the machine.

> Mr Afiq was lying face up in front of the hydraulic press machine, gasping for air. Immediately, colleagues rushed to help him, while the buddy was in shock and could not answer questions.

> According to the investigation officer, a spacer rod that was initially inside the hydraulic press machine is believed to have shot out, penetrating the fencing around the machine and hitting Mr Afiq.

> Mr Afiq was seen lying down with his eyes open and his mouth closed. A colleague saw blood stains around his chin area and opened his mouth with a gloved hand to check if he was choking, as Mr Afiq did not respond to his name.

> Blood started gushing out of his mouth, said the investigation officer, and the colleague pulled out Mr Afiq's tongue to stop him from choking and put him in a recovery position.

> Paramedics arrived swiftly and took him to hospital, where doctors observed that he had been working when an object that weighed 5kg flew into his face.

> He died later that day, with an autopsy report identifying face and chest injuries as the cause of his death. No foul play was found, the investigation officer said.

> The inquiry was attended by Mr Afiq's loved ones, including his sister and fiancee.

> The coroner told the family that he will adjourn the hearing to a later date for an officer from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to respond to some queries he had on the ministry's report into the incident.

> The questions he posed to MOM include whether there was a safety checklist, if there was a set of standard operating procedures for the machine and if this was complied with.

> This is Eve, an otter pup who was only about the size of a human palm.

> She was so young that her eyes had barely opened to see the world.

> Otter newborn abandoned by Bishan family

> Eve was found by an otter watcher on New Year's Eve (Dec. 31, 2020) at Republic Avenue of Beach Road district.

> She was prematurely brought out of the natal holt by her family, the famous Bishan otters, but was left behind by the adult otters.

> No otters came back looking for her and the family moved holt subsequently, as observed by otter watchers.

> These were taken as signs of abandonment by the family, according to a post by long-time otter watcher Chun Kit Soo.

> According to an official statement by the Otter Working Group (OWG), it is unclear why the family abandoned otter Eve.

> One possibility is that otter Eve did not belong to the main breeding pair of the family but from one of the younger females.

> The younger pups would not be able to keep up with the family which is moving between hunting grounds.

> Otters have a complex social dynamic which could have resulted in the pup‚Äôs abandonment, OWG stated.

> This is not the first abandonment case observed in the Bishan family.

> In both instances, the otter pups were not given birth to by the alpha-female of the group.

> Eve was eventually rescued and sent to animal welfare charity Acres after seeing no signs of reunion between Eve and her family.

> A tricky rescue mission

> Eve, estimated to be only two weeks old, was much younger than the otters involved in past rescue missions.

> Hand-raising her proved to be extremely challenging.

> Those who have been following updates on the local otters will know that as an otter grows, it learns how to swim and fish with the adults.

> It takes a village to raise a child, and the same applies to the smooth-coated otter family.

> All in all, it takes 10 months for an otter pup to grow to be independent.

> So how does one provide Eve with the proper environment to grow up equipped with the necessary skills? How will the lack of social interaction with other otters affect her behavioural development?

> Here's another consideration that the Otter Working Group has to take into account: How do they raise Eve until she's ready to be rehabilitated back into the wild, without allowing her to become reliant on humans?

> Lack of expertise and facility

> Members of the Otter Working Group which includes personnel from the National Parks Board, Acres, Wildlife Reserves Singapore, otter watchers, as well as biologist Sivasothi N., gathered in the past week to discuss how to help Eve.

> Many phone calls and text messages were exchanged, and meetings were arranged for discussion and debates, Ottercity's Facebook post said.

> Unfortunately, the group came to the sad conclusion that no one is experienced enough, and Singapore does not have the right facility to raise this otter pup.

> One of the key constraints is the lack of a large rehabilitation space that mimics otters' habitats e.g. rivers, lakes, or ponds for semi-aquatic animals.

> The zoo also does not have a smooth-coated otter collection to take in Eve.

> If Eve were to be left in the wild, she is unlikely to survive on her own.

> With the above considerations, ""every step will be so experimental that it will be at the expense of Eve"", Ottercity explained.

> Euthanasia is regrettably the last resort

> After studying overseas cases and exhausting all possible options, the team made the tough decision to euthanise Eve.

> This is especially so when smooth-coated otters are listed as 'Vulnerable' on the IUCN Red List since 1996. This species, threatened by loss of habitat and illegal pet trade, is at high risk of extinction globally.

> The OWG said:

> ""With the potential for successful rehabilitation unlikely, and in consideration of animal welfare, the OWG therefore made the difficult decision to euthanise the otter pup on humane grounds. ...[The OWG] values and understands the importance of the conservation and welfare of our wildlife, and the decision to put down the otter was not made lightly.""

> Eve died on the afternoon of Jan. 7.

> The otter community said that this is ""an outcome that none [wish] to see"", but is a result of limitations that the team has to accept.

> Following the euthanasia, a necropsy will be conducted by WRS to investigate if there were any health issues that contributed to otter Eve's abandonment.

2220,20,givvmn5,t3_kupy69,"I just want to point out the difficulties involved in hand-rearing very young wild mammals, which require round the clock care for weeks, if not months. Even zoos, with the resources and facilities at their disposal, usually prefer to let the mother raise the young; hand-rearing is usually a last resort. Orphaned babies will be even more challenging, especially if it belongs to a species that's not already represented in the collection.

The challenges of hand-rearing and rehabilitating very young otter pups can be shown by looking at the guidelines written down for other species that are well-represented in zoos and other captive collections.

[Hand Rearing 1.1 Asian Small Clawed Otter (*Amblonyx cinereus*) 21 February 2007 through 2 July 2007](http://www.otterspecialistgroup.org/Library/TaskForces/OCT/HAND_REARING_ASCOTTER.pdf)

Highlights:

> **Hand-rearing is not recommended as an elective process for various reasons**. In almost all cases, the philosophy of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) managers is for the offspring of captive born species to be parent-reared. At times this goal cannot be reached. **When an animal requires hand-rearing it is very important to have a clear and well planned course of action for all staff. The dietary, medical, and social needs of the species must be included in the hand-rearing protocols**. 

> ...

> Fortunately for these two pups they have each other for companionship during the handrearing period. We believe this was beneficial to their well being and contributed to their physical and mental development. They were definitely bonded to the keeper staff, but they played with each other and competed for space in their enclosure when they were not being handled.

Here's another relevant document:

[Successful Hand-rearing and Rehabilitation of North American River Otter (*Lontra canadensis*) Section 1 ‚Äì When to rehabilitate, young pup care, formula feeding, and weaning.](https://www.otterspecialistgroup.org/Library/TaskForces/OCT/North_American_River_Otter_Rehabilitation_Section_1.pdf)

Highlights:

> To maximize the chance of successful rearing and potential release of rehabilitated otters these questions should be asked first:

> * Does the rehabilitator have adequate facilities and time to raise the animal properly?
> * Does the rehabilitator have adequate funds to supply formula and weaning diets to, and perhaps after, release?
> * Is there an appropriate release area available? What is the current state of the otter population in the area?
> * Are facilities and resources available to support and monitor release?
> * Is another rehabilitator more qualified and/or does someone else already have an orphan(s)? If so, it is better for the orphans to be raised together. There is a lower risk of imprinting and they learn from one another.
> * Does the rehabilitator have access daily to large amounts of whole fresh fish?
> * Does the rehabilitator have access to live fish and a pool with a fresh water source for the animal to fish and swim in?
> * Does the rehabilitator have an established relationship with an experienced otter veterinarian?
> * Does the rehabilitator already have an otter diet, husbandry, medical, and release plan established?
> * Does the rehabilitator have a suitably isolated, natural pen (no dogs and limited human presence) where the orphans can be placed as they become more independent?
> * Does the rehabilitator have facilities to hold the otter for at least 9 months?
> * If release is not an option, rehabilitators should begin researching good placement options early.

> If the pup is indeed an orphan and the decision to hand rear is made, the following rules apply.

> * Know the animal's natural history and development time line.
> * **Have as few care takers as possible (ideally just one). Keep human contact to a minimum. The animal will not be releasable if it becomes imprinted, tame, or too accustomed to humans**. This becomes even more critical in the case of single pups.
> * **Few otter pups are suitable for release**. Before this is attempted experienced professionals should be consulted and a plan put in place.
> * Do not house these animals near human or pet trafficked areas.
> * There must not be any positive exposure to dogs.
> * Be prepared ahead of time for the next stage of the animal's growth so he/she need not face undue delays when reaching the next point in development.
> * If you receive a single pup, network with regional rehabilitators in an attempt to locate another orphan(s) so **pups can be raised together**. Otters are very social, active and playful and do much better in groups than when raised alone. The development of normal social behavior skills, natural companionship, healthy competition, added body heat, and physiological comforts are just a few of the benefits of rearing otter pups together. 
> ...
> * **Raising a single otter pup to successful release can be challenging but is possible. This is not the preferred method**.

Even if the Singapore Zoo or a very dedicated individual was able to commit the time and resources to care for this lone pup, what next? Rehabilitation and release is next to impossible, since it will have grown up without the necessary social interaction and guidance of its parents and siblings, and lacking most of the basic skills needed to survive as a wild otter. It can't be introduced to the Asian Small-clawed Otters or Giant Otters that are already in the WRS collection; they're different species and there's a high likelihood that any attempt to mix them will result in bloodshed. Keeping her alone in captivity would not be a great outcome either, for such a sociable species. Hand-raised by humans, she would not have fully developed the necessary skills to actually behave like an otter, and it's unlikely that she could be socialised to the extent that she could be paired with a male of her own species in future and contribute to captive breeding efforts. 

Sure, she could live as someone's pet, but is that really ideal? Just because some people keep otters as pets in some countries doesn't mean that it's easy or even feasible - and note that nearly all of these pets are Asian Small-clawed Otters, the smallest of all the otter species. Smooth-coated Otters grow larger, and apart from zoos, the only people who keep them on a regular basis are some traditional fishing communities in Bangladesh, which as you would expect, live in a very different setting from Singapore. As [this site](https://pethelpful.com/exotic-pets/pet-otter) says about the prospect of keeping pet otters (referring to Asian Small-clawed Otters):

> They are considered to be very high-maintenance, as you would imagine. It takes a tremendous amount of time, effort, patience, and experience to house them, provide them with enrichment, and keep them safe and secure. No matter how much you fantasize about them, you must accept the fact that they are not house pets. Otters are not ferrets; they are not animals that should be kept with the intention of cuddling it.

Even if she managed to survive to maturity, there's a high chance that she would be imprinted on the person who raised her from young, and that person is pretty much stuck with her for the rest of her life. So that person will have to make some dramatic adjustments to their lives in order to accommodate the needs of their ""pet"". In the end, you're left with an otter that doesn't know how to be an otter, probably with separation anxiety, but not exactly tame and domesticated to the same extent as a dog, cat, or even a ferret, with space and other living requirements that most people in Singapore would find difficult to meet, a high risk of being developmentally and socially stunted in many respects because it was raised without any interaction from others of its own species, and that's not even going into the reasons why it was abandoned by its own family in the first place.

As a pet owner, this is a phrase that is uttered many times to me and to others. Raising an animal can be tough, even more so for a non-domesticated animal, considering otters are extremely social and territorial creatures.

They need adult otters to properly teach the young how to swim, hunt, build a home, survive and they need a lot of space for this. 

While they may look cute, otters are known to attack, kill and practise cannibalism especially on unfamiliar/weaker otters.

But I think Mothership actually explains it better:

> ‚Ä¶isochrones means a line on a diagram or map connecting points relating to the same time or equal times.

> Isochrone maps that are colour-coded allows one to intuitively understand how far one can travel from a specific location within a certain amount of time by, say, using public transport.

2343,20,e5srjhc,t1_e5sgjds,"Welps, the point of departure for using hawker centres was to use them as a crude measure to weight various parts of Singapore, as opposed to weighting all points equally.

But as /u/evilpinksayaka has mentioned, it unfairly penalises the northern areas.

I think the ideal measure would have been to use geographic distribution of residents and jobs, but a good reliable source for those datasets is kinda hard to come by. So I settled on a poorman‚Äôs solution of using hawker centres as a proxy measure for both.

The interactivity is a good idea though, since accessibility is contextual to the end user; a firm might deem accessibility to be access to a workforce, while a homeowner might deem accessibility to be access to amenities and/or work.

[From the WHO website](who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses):

> The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets generated when a person, for example, coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.

So probably not through sweat directly, but in a gym where people exert themselves physically and increase respiratory activity, there's probably a lot of aerosolised particles from gym-goers breathing hard.",t3_f7xrvz,23-02-2020
2463,20,filtete,t1_fiino10,"It's similar to SARS & there was a study published about the SARS virus in sweat glands. 

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15141376](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15141376)

""In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS-CoV in the  intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces,  urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission. ""

It's not about skin to skin contact like a handshake that is the concern but you touch the sweat with your hand then to your mouth/nose transmission.

Asymptomatic spread has been confirmed by China, how does that spread?

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html)

**There is still more to be learned**

COVID-19 is an emerging disease and there is more to learn about its transmissibility, severity, and other features and what will happen in the United States. New information will further inform the risk assessment.

**So the point to note is don't assume how it's limitations of spreading, remember it's (SARS-CoV-2) already been said to be more infectious than SARS (SARS-COV). The other relevant difference is that the illness ""co vid-19"" that SARS-CoV-2 causes seems to be less fatal than SARS.**",t3_f7xrvz,24-02-2020

> The People's Action Party has been accused of putting up posters this 2020 General Election campaigning season that do not bear the official stamp issued by the Returning Officer.

> This accusation was levelled at the PAP in a Facebook post by Williamson Lee, a Singapore People's Party candidate.

> Lee wrote that he had seen multiple PAP posters in the Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC where he is contesting with his team that are without the stamp.

> Lee wrote in his post:

> Every poster and banner put up must have a sticker accompanying it. This sticker is one that is issued by ELD and can only be collected after nomination. The purpose of this sticker is to limit the number of posters and banners one can put up so as to try and level the playing field. If one is allowed to put up banners without stickers, then of course they can ""flood"" the GRC with an seemingly unlimited number of posters.

> According to the Elections Department Singapore, the official stamp issued by the Returning Officer is necessary.

> ELD wrote in their campaigning rules: ""All posters and banners displayed must bear the official stamp issued by the Returning Officer.""

> The stamp is needed to cap the total number of posters put up by one party in each constituency.

> Mothership has reached out to ELD for comment

> What is official stamp by Returning Officer?

> The official stamp by the Returning Officer is visible on posters put up during the GE campaigning period.

> This is what it traditionally looks like:

> In the current GE2020, posters are marked by a brown stamp:

> The posters put up by PAP in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC apparently lacks the stamp by the Returning Officer:

> Rules governing the quantity of posters and banners a political party can put up can be found in the latest candidate handbook for general election issued by ELD.

> According to the document, it wrote:

> At the end of nomination proceedings, the Returning Officer will issue to the candidate or his election agent a permit authorising the display of posters and banners in public places within the electoral division where the candidate is contesting in. Posters and banners may take the form of a small or large printed election advertising. The permit will specify the maximum number and size of small and large printed election advertising (whether in the form of a poster or a banner) allowed to be displayed in public places within the electoral division and may contain certain conditions restricting the type of printed election advertising authorised to be displayed, and the place at and manner in which they may be displayed. The formulae to compute the maximum number of small and large printed election advertising is as follows: Number of small printed election advertising allowed: 1 small printed election advertising to every 50 electors in the register (rounded to nearest 100) Subject to minimum of: ‚Ä¢ 500 per SMC ‚Ä¢ 2,000 per 4-MP GRC ‚Ä¢ 2,500 per 5-MP GRC

""Miss, miss, please do you have 5 minutes? I need to share with you about God The Mother"", this woman loudly said.

""God..the Mother"", I pondered and stood still in my tracks while glancing at her with a raised eyebrow.

The middle-aged woman quickly walked over and waved the flyer at me.

""God the Mother"", were the words written on the flyer.

""Hi Miss, thank you for stopping. I'd like to discuss briefly about God the Mother to you. So...avberfeireorne ejnfg3engfw iwrwjregwr gjrpiwg...."", she said.

A sigh left me again as I finally met her gaze, and I mustered the courage to say a few words that eventually left her stunned, angry and, most importantly, speechless.

> Those exercising at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park in the next few days might catch a glimpse of a new safe distancing ""officer"".

> SPOT the four-legged robot will be helping out with safe distancing operations on the ground.

> This is part of a pilot trial between the National Parks Board (NParks) and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG), which comprises the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office and Government Technology Agency.

> Reduces manpower needed for patrols

> From May 8, SPOT will be deployed over a 3km stretch in the River Plains section of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park for two weeks during off-peak hours.

> The robot will broadcast a recorded message to remind park visitors to observe safe distancing measures.

> SPOT is also outfitted with cameras, with GovTech-developed video analytics, to estimate the number of visitors in the park.

> They received the robot in September 2019, the GovTech team developed the software needed for safe distancing purposes. The original from Boston Dynamics does not have these software installed.

> SPOT can travel at speeds of around 1.6m/s, and is quite a loud walker, so joggers are made aware of its presence. SPOT is weather-proof and is able to constantly measure its own center of gravity so it can right itself up if it does fall.

> It can also cause mass confusion to organic doggos.

> NParks and SNDGG assured in their press release that the cameras will not be able to recognise specific individuals or collect personal data.

> The robot, which can controlled remotely, helps reduce the manpower required for park patrols, and simultaneously minimises the physical contact between staff, volunteer safe distancing ambassadors, and park visitors.

> Here are some snapshots from SPOT's first day at the job.

> Built-in algorithms enable it to detect obstacles within a 1-metre proximity to avoid any sort of collision.

> During this pilot trial, SPOT however, will still be accompanied by one NParks officer.

> Currently trialling at Changi Exhibition Centre too

> If the trial is successful, NParks will consider deploying SPOT at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio park at peak hours in the morning and evening.

> Plans to deploy SPOT to other parks like Jurong Lake Gardens are also in the works.

> Currently, not only is SPOT roving around at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, it is also being trialled at Changi Exhibition Centre.

> The centre is designated as a community isolation facility, where around 2,700 Covid-19 patients are housed.

> At the facility, SPOT is used to deliver essential items like medicine to patients.

> SNDGG will explore the use of SPOT to support other Covid-19-related operations.

> In the past six months, there have been four other resale transactions in Natura Loft that involved prices over $1,000,000.

> Here's the pricing information from the HDB website:

> The trend of million-dollar resale transactions at Natura Loft seems to have began even earlier, however.

> It was previously reported that a flat was sold for S$1.07 million at the start of the Circuit Breaker period.

> DBSS flats

> DBSS flats tend to attract premium prices.

> Flats built under the DBSS scheme are purchased directly from the developer and not from HDB.

> The flats also have different features from HDB BTO flats (which tend to have a standard layout), so they resemble condo units more than HDB flats.

> There are 13 DBSS projects in Singapore, including Park Central at Ang Mo Kio, Trivelis at Clementi, The Peak @ Toa Payoh and Parc Lumiere at Simei.

> A five-room DBSS flat in Boon Keng was sold for S$1.185 million at the start of 2019.

> In 2017, resale prices for over 40 HDB flats crossed the million-dollar mark.

> These included a five-room flat at the [email protected] (S$1.14 million), and a five-room HDB resale flat at Natura Loft (S$1.18 million).

2811,20,fctsg9e,t3_eiw3rm,"> # New S$100m Eunoia JC campus is Singapore‚Äôs first ‚Äòhigh-rise‚Äô junior college

> SINGAPORE: With their sleek green-tinted glass windows, expansive open spaces and greenery lining their walls, the two new towering blocks along Sin Ming Place could be mistaken for office buildings.

> But they are not.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> They form part of Eunoia Junior College's (EJC) new campus which boasts the tallest buildings among JCs in Singapore.

> The campus was built upwards to compensate for the smaller four-hectare plot of land it sits on, compared to the six-hectare average plot size of other JCs. One of the academic blocks is 10-storeys high, the other reaches 12 storeys.

> 

> 

> The Ministry of the Ministry of Education (MOE) said EJC cost S$100 million to construct. In its 2019 budget documents, the ministry said the total project cost for the development of the campus was estimated at almost S$144 million.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The total development cost of the project, which includes consultancy costs, improvement works and other related fees, is still being finalised and is expected to be lower than what was budgeted, said the ministry.

> The main building of Eunoia Junior College has 12 storeys that give a scenic view of the surrounding neighbourhood of Bishan. (Photo: Rauf Khan)

> DESIGNED FOR STUDENT INTERACTION

> A duplex library takes up the ninth and tenth floors of one of the academic blocks. It offers a panoramic view of nearby Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. The library is part of a student hub, which includes an activity deck on level 10, an art studio and special learning rooms.

> A stage within the library provides a space where students ‚Äúcan perform spontaneously‚Äù, said principal Mrs Wong Mei Heng.

> The interaction areas are ‚Äúreally huge spaces created for the students to carry out many of the activities to facilitate their bonding and facilitate the ability to initiate activities‚Äù, said Mrs Wong.

> The multiple floors of Eunoia Junior College are separated with green spaces that are accessible for staff and students. (Photo: Rauf Khan)

> ‚ÄúThe learning spaces are designed from the start with the intention of encouraging collaboration, encouraging active student life, and encouraging the students to really make use of space to support their learning,‚Äù she added.

> The 2-storey library of Eunoia Junior College aims to provide students with a conducive area to study with a view overlooking Bishan Park. (Photo: Rauf Khan)

> Students were invited to give input on how they would like the spaces in the new campus to be furnished and who gets to operate stalls at the canteen.

> ‚ÄúWhen we selected and shortlisted our canteen vendors, the students joined us in tasting the food and giving us the vote. So all the vendors that we bring in really are a result of students‚Äô vote,‚Äù said Mrs Wong.

> Eunoia Junior College at Sin Ming Place ((Photo: Muhd Raydza Abd Rahman, Shi Hui Por, Raszman Abdul Rasid)

> PERCEPTION OF IP SCHOOLS ""HAS NOT BEEN VERY FAIR""

> EJC took in its first batch of students in 2017 at its interim campus at Mount Sinai. Students from the Integrated Programme (IP) of Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls‚Äô School and Singapore Chinese Girls‚Äô School make up about two-thirds of the 1,250-strong student body.

> The remaining one-third are students from the O-Level track, and they come from about 80 different schools, said Mrs Wong. The school has about 120 teachers.

> Responding to questions on the perception that EJC is an elite school with mostly IP students, Mrs Wong said: ‚ÄúActually maybe the perception of IP schools has not been very fair because our students grow in the heartlands of Singapore as well. And they face every challenge that every teenager faces.‚Äù

> Mrs Wong said that classes are mixed, all students choose their co-curricular activities at the same time, and the college‚Äôs flagship IP programmes are available to students from the O-Level track as well.

> ‚ÄúAbout two-thirds of our students come from IP schools that have rich traditions, and they have four years of forging friendships and they‚Äôre going to have another two years to continue that. But they are also sensitive to the fact that there will be another batch of college mates that come in and join in. Inclusivity is something that we have focused on right from the start,‚Äù she said.

> ‚ÄúFor us, I think it is important that once our students come into EJC, then they are Eunoians and we don‚Äôt differentiate between IP and JAE (joint admissions exercise) students.‚Äù

> Eunoia Junior College's 900-seater auditorium will also serve as a lecture theatre. (Photo: Rauf Khan)

> Student mixing is one of the major factors that influenced the design of the college‚Äôs new campus. Next to the classroom blocks is a five-storey student activities centre that houses an eight-lane track and full-sized field on its roof. It also houses a 900-seat lecture theatre, the canteen, and Bishan North Community Club.

> As the first JC to be co-located with a community club, Mrs Wong said that the plan is for students to be involved in activities such as reading programmes for children, digital literacy programmes for the elderly, and organising activities for residents.

> An elevated stadium is located on the top of the student activities block, consisting of a football field and an 8 lane running track. (Photo: Rauf Khan)

> LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEW CAMPUS

> On Jan 6, a symbolic relay from Mount Sinai to Bishan via Rifle Range Road and the Central Nature Reserve, will mark the move to the new campus.

> ""We will miss Mount Sinai but we look forward to the Bishan campus. In terms of giving closure to our students, some of them were also involved in saying goodbye to Ghim Moh, because, in a way, we would say that the school has grown up in Ghim Moh,"" said Mrs Wong.

> Appreciation notes written by the students had been distributed to the stallholders at Ghim Moh hawker centre, a Eunoian haunt for the past three years, she said: ""It‚Äôs touching to see the students value a space that they also have been able to learn from.""

> SINGAPORE: Two men were hurt after a¬†fire broke out at a coffee shop in¬†Bishan on Monday night (Apr 2).

> The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted at 11.06pm to the incident at Block 514A¬†Bishan Street 13¬†and dispatched resources to the location.

> The fire involved contents at the¬†coffee shop and was extinguished¬†using two water jets, SCDF said.

> The two men were¬†taken to Singapore General Hospital.¬†

> Video footage of the fire showed bright orange flames and plumes of thick smoke rising from the building.¬†

> Aircraft engineer Melvin Huang, 30, told Channel NewsAsia he was waiting for a bus at the Bishan Bus Interchange when he saw the blaze at around 11pm.

> ""The police and SCDF (had) already arrived and blocked off the whole area,"" he said.

> ""I didn&apos;t smell any smoke from the interchange,"" he said, adding that the fire ""looked like it burnt half of the coffee shop"".

> Members of the public were not allowed to go near the area, he said, but added that nearby shops were not affected.

We don't even have enough information to know the severity of her symptoms on the 15th for her to still go to work (could be one of those mild morning flu from her pov, once again I'm speculating here just like some of you cos no details given).

But what we do know is it got to the point where she actually went to the doctor 2 days later to get herself checked from feeling unwell.

Fyi that's the purpose of us masking up, in case we are symptomatic/asymptomatic carriers and if so, to prevent ourselves from spreading it to others. If she maintained her mask-wearing and social distancing in her front-line of duty as all SMRT staff are required, it's not complete incompetence. Negligent?

More than 1,500 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats could be available by 2025  in Bishan, one of Singapore's most sought after housing estates.

The Housing Board has called for a quotation for a traffic im-pact  assessment (TIA) for a proposed public housing development in the area.

In documents seen by The Straits Times, HDB said that the proposed  development will consist of six residential blocks from 22 to 39 storeys  high.

They will have roof gardens and offer a total of 1,504 two-, three-and four-room units.

Proposed amenities include a childcare centre, a residents' committee centre, a minimart, a coffee shop and other shops.

The 44,424 sq m site in Bishan Street 14 is next to the Kallang  River, and between the Kuo Chuan Presbyterian primary and secondary  schools and the Ministry of Education Language Centre's Bishan campus.

It is about 400m, or a five-minute walk, from Bishan MRT station.

#### [Why HDB flat dwellers have the best of both worlds](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/why-hdb-flat-dwellers-have-the-best-of-both-worlds)

The last time new flats were built in Bishan was in 2006, when 176 studio apartments designed for the elderly were launched.

An HDB spokesman said: ""The TIA study at Bishan East is for a  proposed future comprehensive development that includes public housing.  More information will be provided when the detailed plans are ready.""

Mr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA Realty, said  of the proposed development: ""It is very rare to get BTOs in Bishan...  With the site's close location to a primary school and an MRT station  which already has a mall, you can expect very high application rates.""

""Chances are flat prices will be more expensive, but it is fair,  given that they will likely fetch a higher price on the resale market  too,"" he added.

Dr Steven Choo, a veteran urban planner and chairman of real estate  advisory firm Vestasia Group, said that the waterfront view of the  Kallang River should make the homes very attractive, in particular the  units on high floors.

The Bishan East site used to house the ITE College Central's Bishan campus until the school moved out in 2013.

The campus was then taken over by St Joseph's Institution until end-2016.

The area is now designated for residential use in the Urban Redevelopment Authority's masterplan.

Other housing projects in the pipeline include 4,500 BTO flats in Ang  Mo Kio, Tampines and Tengah, which HDB will offer next month.

Another 3,000 BTO flats in Sembawang and Toa Payoh will be released next February.

Last week, The Straits Times reported that more than 5,000 new homes could be launched in Queenstown by 2027.

About 2,060 of these homes could be ready by as early as 2021 or 2022.",t3_dlqmf6,22-10-2019
