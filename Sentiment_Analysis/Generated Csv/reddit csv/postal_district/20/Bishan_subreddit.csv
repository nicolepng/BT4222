23,20,Rant on Bishan MRT station,241,8twi70,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8twi70/rant_on_bishan_mrt_station/,118,26-06-2018,"As you all know, Bishan MRT caters to 2 lines, the NS line and the Circle line. Who on earth thought it was a good idea to convert this MRT station into an interchange?

It is seriously the least conducive station to house an interchange. The layout of the station itself is problematic. Even before the circle line, this bloody station was overcrowded every single day.

My problems are below:

* **There is very little space in the station platforms.** **The layout itself is problematic.** There are huge blocks of pillars everywhere on the platform itself. The capacity of the platform is drastically low compared to above-land stations. Queues cannot stretch longer than a few metres. During peak hours there is zero space to house people. Staff have to STOP people from entering the platform regularly because there is no more space to stand in the platform. Queues in the Circle Line link and the main entrance often stretch to more than 30 metres.
* **I cannot stress how poor the layout of the station is.** I'm referring to the NS line platform mainly. The escalators to the main exit is in the middle of the station, like all stations. This normally wouldn't be a problem. Except the escalator leading people in from the Circle Line is also in the middle! During peak hours there is a huge strain in the middle of the platform due to people from circle line and alighting passengers clashing with each other. They could have alleviated this by placing the escalators leading to CL at the two ends of the platform instead, like Paya Lebar station.
* **The staff are overworked and poorly equipped.** I pity the staff working there so much. They have to physically stop people from entering the NS platform during peak hours.  They need to co-ordinate between allowing people in from the circle line + ppl from the main entrance to prevent over-crowding. Never seen such an overworked crew. However they don't seem to co-ordinate properly. I don't see them talking on their radio sets often. They let people in after a train leaves the platform. But by the time im at the platform, the next train arrives and a fuckton of people alight, causing a gridlock people who want to exit the platform and people who want to enter it. They frequently shout at passengers to ""move to the end of the platform"" but the situation there is no better than the middle.
* **The link towards Circle Line is too small.** On each NS Line platform, there is 1 wide opening. For the escalators connecting the Circle Line and the NS line. There is 1 escalator going up and another 1 going down, in the middle got 1 staircase. This isn't nearly enough during peak hours when there are trains coming in dropping people off every 2 minutes. The influx of people doesn't match the rate of outgoing. With each arriving train, the human buildup increases. It's such a annoying sight to put up with every morning. Already having your face pressed against the door in the train, finally reaching Bishan to transfer to the Circle Line, then seeing a giant queue in the platform itself.

This is the end of my rant. I hope the person who made the decision to have Circle Line in Bishan gets fired. It's obvious the planning was not as forward-thinking as they thought. Ang Mo Kio, literally one station after Bishan, is infinitely better equipped to handle greater capacity crowds. But they chose Bishan to house the interchange instead."

Here are some observations in case anyone is thinking of going down to check it out.

TLDR: The nicest parts are in the segment nearer to Bishan Park. For people living in the area: Hurray! It’s open again. If you are thinking of traveling over from elsewhere to take a look: Forget it, stick to Bishan Park.

Improvements:

* The vegetation and rocks are arranged to produce a waterfall like sound. Really soothing.
* New platform and another larger gathering spot provides good place to stop, rest and chill out
* More brightly lit at night
* Path feels wider cos they merged the running and cycling path

Like that only ah?:

* From certain angles, looks like a big longkang with a smaller longkang inside
* Was expecting the whole thing to look like the Bishan Park stream. You mean we waited so many years for just like that?
* Still not fully linked to Kallang as the overhead bridge is not completed. But there are no clear signs telling you how to temporarily get to the other part of Kallang PCN.

My first impression of it was a bit underwhelming. The best parts were the ones that they already opened a month ago for “preview”. The remaining portion is just a big longkang. There are a number of negative comments about the cost and no doubt some people might be thinking that $85 million is a waste of money for “like that only”. But to be fair the ABC waterways projects are mainly drainage upgrading projects which have beautification as a secondary objective. The canal does look a lot bigger and deeper than before, especially nearer to Braddell. Overall I’m just glad that the route is open again. Looking forward to more runs to Bishan Park.

<Edit: included map on alternate ways to get around the segment that is still closed>
