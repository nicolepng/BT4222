2,1,Rating Work/Study areas (Part 1 ?) - Golden Village Gold Class Lounge Suntec City,124,jtfyjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jtfyjb/rating_workstudy_areas_part_1_golden_village_gold/,13,13-11-2020,"hey kiddos! ive seen a lot of people (students) asking about areas to study/work and decided to just jot down my thoughts on my experience and have something to do other than my assignments hehe :D if anyone wants, i'll try to do this every week (depends on my workload ;\_;) to help out whoever needs it lol. didnt post on sgexams bc i had no idea how to tag it \\\^\^"" TL;DR at the end\~

&#x200B;

**Assessiblity:** üëçüëçüëç out of 3üëçs

\- About 5 minute walk from Promenade MRT

\- Free wifi that is not slow :D managed to watch all my lectures and another long video without buffering (long video was in HD too!)

\- Got socket to charge your devices! Staff also got give extension cord so everyone can use

\- Toilet is in the lounge too!

&#x200B;

**Comfort:** üëçüëç

\- Free-seating but only a few tables got access to the socket

\- I sat in the chair with no backing so my back is like crying after 6 hours. Chair is soft soft cushion kind so quite comfy la

\- Aircon is good! Not super strong its like low low temp and the fan speed low so just nice no need jacket. Also heard today very hot and i hate the hot weather so thats a plus!

\- Table is literally stone cold kind so i started sneezing and everyone scared of me now ;\_;

\- Table also a bit small because i went with two other friends, didn't really have space to write anything since i had my laptop. But if you're going alone or with one other person, there should be enough space :D

\- Got this two TVs flashing all the movie trailers a bit distracting lol so i sat with my back to it :D

\- good lighting

&#x200B;

**Price:** üëçüëç

\- $15 for 6 hours (12pm-6pm) until 20 Nov, subsequently $25 after 20 Nov

\- Inclusive of a cup of coffee or tea (I dont drink either ;\_;) and a regular popcorn + Free flow of cold/normal (probably tap) water in plastic cup with straw

\- Includes a $9.50 discount movie ticket voucher) valid for 2 weeks on Friday-Sunday only because i went on Friday (If you go Mon-Thurs, then you get Mon-Thurs discount voucher)

\- Not good for broke students lol

&#x200B;

Other stuff:

\- Eat before you come lol i forgot to eat breakfast/lunch so i wanted to buy their lounge food (range from $10-$20 - GV Movie Club got 10% off!!) but they only open at 3pm -\_- so i brought in food from BK next door - staff nv chase us out so i guess its sort of ok

\- You can purchase the ""pass"" for access to the lounge beforehand in the same week, but tbh it wasnt crowded at all so walking in to buy is ok la

\- Please remember wear mask after you eat finish. The two guys next to me just maskless like majority of the time i was there ;\_;

&#x200B;

**Overall:** 4/5, could be 4.5 if i got a better chair :P probably won't go back when price becomes $25 lol
