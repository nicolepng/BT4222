109,1,gia1rsg,t1_gi9xtyz,"No. This is a public place. There's a high chance of CCTV, or random members of the public who might have seen him before or after he died. There should be quite a lot of fresh forensics evidence to know how he died (they haven't told us anything about injuries or lack thereof). Maybe a little bit of digging will reveal that he was involved in a gang, or he was depressed and jumped, or someone had a clear motive.

You jump to TT right away, you're going to get a long list of IC numbers who were near him (or his body). And if it was murder, it could have been someone who was only near him for a minute, so if the murderer had TT on, it would look like any random person who stood or walked near the victim for a short while. Imagine if you worked OT at One Raffles Place and the police start questioning you. You have no alibi because you actually were there at the scene. Is the police going to dig into the personal histories of potentially hundreds of people just because they were nearby, to see if they could possibly have a motive? It doesn't make sense and it's intrusive.

I mean, if this guy died in an ulu forest in the middle of the night and there's no leads, maybe TT could help? But certainly not in this case.",t3_krgasp,06-01-2021

It was only after I finished reading the book that I realized that he had been a thinker years ahead of his time and that the national media had been demonizing the man.

This was a man who pointed out that:

1. the asset enhancement programme (and the growth of property prices) promised by Goh Chok Tong would destroy the retirement adequacy of many Singaporeans
2. Singapore's education system is excessively focused on exams
3. our over dependency on MNC's means that we have no way of upgrading our technological capabilities in industry and moving up the value chain without their help (unlike countries like Germany and South Korea who have their own national champions)
4. the move to import foreign talent in large numbers is a sign of the failure of our schools  to produce the kind of human resources needed to meet the needs of our economy

These are issues that are only now being discussed in Singapore without prejudice. If only we had listened to this man...

I know you started this thread not with the intention to bring him disregard.. but the comments seem to have taken a turn that way. 

What is wrong for a man to be more vocal about his begging? In my opinion, most people who beg need the money. 

Do you think they are psychopaths who are willing to do anything it takes to act as a beggar to get money? If that was the case, they could have acted in other roles to do so. This world has plenty of opportunities for such nasty people. 

Alternatively, if he is acting, he has mental illness. That in itself is something that should be pitied. 

It is not easy being him, i have seen him begging outdoors at 12pm. It is very hot at the time!

Bought tissue from him couple times but I never actually spoke to him before. But every time I do he’ll be sure to say “Thank you sir, God bless you good luck”.

I must say he “works” very hard and treats it like a real job. Shouting out there in the hot sun for hours can be very tiring. He takes the mrt here in the morning and leaves in the evening like most of us.

And in the past two years when chevron house / change alley mall was under construction, there was no lift access from the mrt to the ground plaza - the nearest lift is at republic plaza and he has to navigate through an obstacle course just to get there.

Whether he has a mental illness I don’t know, and why he still chooses to be a tissue peddler at Raffles Place and shout his throat out instead of doing Grabfood I’m not sure too. But it’s very easy to just ignore him instead of getting irritated by him. He’s just there to make a living his own way like the rest of us. 

I don’t know his story but thank you for asking.

> Stand-off in Raffles Place over owed rent

> Landlord seizes 4 eateries over $686,000 rent arrears, staff locked out

> A stand-off over rent arrears has led to the landlord of the Singapore Land Tower locking up, in total, four restaurants, bars and lounges in the 48-storey skyscraper in Raffles Place.

> Some 50 staff of the food and beverage establishments turned up yesterday in a bid to retrieve their personal belongings left within the premises on the 45th floor.

> Owner S.L. Development moved in on Monday to repossess the premises after some $685,957 was allegedly owed in unpaid rent and three letters of demand were sent by its lawyers from Lee & Lee.

> Mr Christopher Lim, the managing director of Fifty Raffles Place, which owns the four outlets, claimed the company was willing to settle the debt. However, talks had stalled over conditions attached.

> Fifty Raffles Place is a glass penthouse located on the 45th and 46th levels of the building and offers a 360-degree view of the Marina Bay, Fort Canning and blue seas.

> The 45th level houses the multiconcept F&B quartet of Angie’s Oyster Bar, Empire Sky Lounge, Sear Steakhouse and Lower East Side 45.

> DRAGGED INTO DISPUTE Whatever the dispute, you should not get innocent people like us involved. ’’ MS ERICA NG (left), whose headphones, laptop and hard disk were locked inside one of four locked eateries.

> Mr Lim said yesterday: “When I went to work on Monday, I had no access to anything there, including suppliers’ stocks, staff shift details to pay salaries, customer reservations and bookings and staff belongings.”

> He added that reservations and private corporate events had to be cancelled and walk-in patrons found the premises locked up.

> Events manager Jezzle Meier, who was among the employees who turned up yesterday, said: “It is all very frustrating, not only for me but also my team and my clients and I don’t think we deserve this.”

> Ms Meier said she was there to get her personal laptop, events documents and personal phone. They have been stuck in the premises since the lockdown on Monday.

> “Whatever happened, it’s not our fault, it’s between the two managements. I don’t think you have the right to stop the staff, especially when we have personal belongings.”

> Another employee, Ms Erica Ng, added: “Whatever the dispute, you should not get innocent people like us involved.” Ms Ng said her belongings, including her headphones, laptop and hard disk were “trapped inside”. She was one of 14 employees who submitted forms to access the premises, three at a time, between 11.15am and 1pm yesterday.

> Mr Lim said they were told only at about 4.50pm that access to the venues would only be until 8pm, but it was too late to notify other employees.

> The landlord’s lawyer, Mr Toh Kok Seng, said “the tenant had made various offers of partial payment with conditions attached which the landlord was unable to accept”.

> He added that the tenant was first informed on Monday that employees could collect their belongings the following day.

> They had to submit a list of names with items to be collected by each employee, to avoid allegations of loss or damage to property.

> He said the tenant responded on the same day but “made no mention of any desire to have their employees collect belongings”.

> The forms were eventually accepted yesterday from the tenant’s representative and access was granted from 11am.

> “They can request if they need more time,” added Mr Toh.

> ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO Fifty Raffles Place managing director Christopher Lim (wearing cap) speaking to his staff outside the Singapore Land Tower yesterday. They were locked out after a dispute with the landlord.

> SINGAPORE: Turn up at 12pm at Raffles Place and pay S$3 into a box to get S$50 in return was the premise of what seemed to be a publicity stunt on Wednesday (Feb 28).

> But the excitement of the afternoon ended after an hour, as hundreds of people had gathered in hopes of getting free money, resulting in the organiser calling a halt to proceedings.

>        Hundreds showed up at Raffles Place for the 3 dollar baller machine on Wednesday (Feb 28). (Photo: Christy Yip)   

> The crowd, that was jostling and shoving around the box, was asked to disperse at 12.45pm by the organiser, who was previously seen talking to two uniformed officers for about 10 minutes. 

> The organiser claimed that she was told to stop by the police. 

> “I’m very sorry but because the police is already here, we have to stop the activation. It’s very unfortunate that we cannot continue so for your safety, please slowly disperse from this location,” the organiser told the disappointed crowd.

>        Police were seen at Raffles Place, where hundreds turned up to try their luck at the 3 dollar baller cash vending machine. (Photo: Christy Yip)   

> Earlier that morning at 11.30am, about 300 people were seen lining up in front of the cash vending machine, called #3dollarballer on its website, that was stationed just outside Chevron House.

> At 11.45am, efforts were made by the organiser to move the box to the pavement by Battery Road - triggering a mad rush as crowds surged forward to follow the money booth. 

>        Hundreds turned up for the 3 dollar baller machine at Raffles Place on Wednesday (Feb 28). (Photo: Christy Yip)   

> Then at 12pm, the box was shifted once more to the grass patch in front of Chevron House where the crowd grew in strength. 

> The first person to successfully feed the machine S$3 to receive her S$50 was 30-year-old Kate Koh.

> “I work around here and my colleague told me about this event happening. I was quite lucky because I was standing near the area the box moved to,” she said. 

> Channel NewsAsia saw six people successfully try the cash vending machine. 

> Another man who got his chance, 74-year-old Jeffrey Yao, said he only followed the crowd after seeing the box. 

> ""I was just passing by, so I didn’t know what was going on. I queued for about 20 minutes to get the S$50,"" Mr Yao said. 

>        A man with the S$50 note he got from the cash vending machine. (Photo: Christy Yip)   

> Teenager June Yeo did not get her chance, however. She waited for about an hour in line. 

> ""It’s quite sad that I didn’t manage to get (the money). But I think this kind of thing is good because who doesn’t want free money?"" said the 16-year-old. 

> Another teenager who did not want to be named told Channel NewsAsia that the crowd scared him. “All this pushing and shoving, I’m wondering now if it is worth it,” he said.  

> Ash Low, 28, turned up only because he wanted to find out who is behind the stunt after finding out about it on Instagram. 

> ""I think it is quite interesting as they haven&apos;t revealed who is behind this so I want to find out,"" Mr Low said, adding that he had intended to spend the entire lunch time here. 

> ""We wanted to come early at first because we were not sure how it was going to turn out. But looks like there is a very big turn out.""

>        The 3 dollar baller cash vending machine gives out a S$50 note for every S$3 inserted. (Photo: Christy Yip)    

> The promotion, which has gained prominence on social media, is due to make another appearance at 313@Somerset this afternoon, according to its website. It appeared on Orchard Road on Tuesday between 5pm and 8pm. 

>        (Photo: Christy Yip)   

> The machine is actually a man inside the box handing out the S$50 dollar whenever someone feeds S$3 in. 

> When the organisers were asked if the second installment for Wednesday would go on, they said they had no comment. 

> Channel NewsAsia has reached out to the police for more information.

at this point why not just nationalise the trains?

but now with lta owning so much of the assets and making so many decisions wrt rail operations. why not just nationalise it. any inefficiency with government control will be outweighed by the gains from better running train system right?

i mean the government should be better at this than smrt. and the licensing scheme seems quite toothless considering there is only 2 companies who can run trains in sg. duopoly is hardly much different than monopoly and both are not even remotely close to a competitive market where benefits of privatization are comparatively huge.",t3_7z74lx,22-02-2018

360,1,dumwjro,t1_dumrws8,"Both schemes, Bus Contracting Models (BCM) and New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF) has roots in generally, European countries and is 'imported' here, slightly modified to suit our needs here.

While privatization did not work, under NRFF and BCM, LTA can actively penalise the train companies, which keeps them in check. It isn't really true that only a duopoly can operate the lines in Singapore, the licensing for Thomson East Coast Line changed due to the line having to open in five stages, hence a provision license of only 8 years under a slightly modified NRFF scheme with more similarities to BCM. A third and even forth operator may be possible, just not in the near future since the NRFF has just recently materialised.

Nationalisation is not a simple, let's buy over all assets and operate be operated by the Government. There are certainly factors to consider, such as profitability, innovation and passenger satisfaction. LTA has also been actively training their own crew of maintenance staff, supposedly in a way, to look after the operator's operations and to take over in case of bankruptcy ([straits times article!](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/rail-nationalisation-govt-may-simply-be-reclaiming-its-engineers))

British Rail is one good example and it had declining satisfaction rates since the start until the government re-privatised railway companies in the 1990s. 

Assets wise, LTA all operating assets under NRFF so as to ease the process of handing over the license to another operator once the lease it up. Decisions wise, under NRFF, as stated in the article, LTA makes decisions about infrastructure or trains. They are operating it as a on-contract basis, SMRT and SBS Transit are just two examples of companies who operate rail lines and stations, maintain trains and assets on behalf of LTA.",t3_7z74lx,22-02-2018

What do you propose? Dig up the roads? No one's going to do that in busy, built up areas in 1968 (yes, 50 years ago) where a better alternative (tunnel boring machine) is available, let alone 2018.

Even the MTR and Taipei Metro are built the same way.

>They cut one section of the track away and bring in a prefabricated section in

I did think about this, but it's actually far more disruptive, because you're literally demolishing the entire railway track and putting it back together, which means you have to reconnect all the power, signalling and whatnot.

At least this way temporary measures can be put in place to keep all the other systems where they should be while the roadbed is rebuilt.
",t3_7z74lx,22-02-2018
366,1,dumx95b,t1_dumvxu2,"Yes this is what i mentioned too, there's only two issues:
1. this replacement is time critical, unscheduled, meaning it broke before the supposed durability period is up, ie. sooner or later the replacement has to be done, if not the slab will disintegrate

2. prefab segments of rail is good for a new rail line, not for a in operation line, by doing that, the only nearest point to bring the prefab segments in is via Bishan Depot, which means a complete shutdown is requried to hack, remove rails and hang in the new prefab segments. We, especially in the city, don't have the luxury of that since people are getting in and out, the earliest only can be planned similar to ECLO, after the CNY period, meaning thats half a month after the faults started, which isn't feasible.

Other countries can shutdown cos 1. they have an alternative track for existing trains to ply, 2. passenger numbers along the stretch is not a lot hence they can, provide bus bridging. 

For NSL, during the Early Closure, Late Opening (ECLO) programme, they have indeed shutdown the segment between City Hall and Raffles Place, but long wait times will occur, since from Orchard to City Hall, thats 1 train doing the shuttling and 15minutes per train, same goes to Raffles Place to Marina South Pier segment. 

To do that, either on a weekend or weekday on a full day basis is disruptive to the city life and its Chinese New Year period. Prefab orders also take a while to arrive and line speed wouldn't instantly increase back to 80km/h, its progressive so with less work and at a faster speed, cast in-situ is still the least disruptive way of performing such repairs",t3_7z74lx,22-02-2018
