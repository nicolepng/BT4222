37,1,ftdq6vh,t1_ftcm2rp,"In physics, there's the idea of mirror particles. Essentially, the idea is that there are particles that are functionally identical to the ones we're familiar to, like photons, electrons etc; however, they have the opposite parity. As such, they're unable to interact with ordinary matter except via gravity. As these particles are all functionally identical, there could be an entire universe out there, with stars, planets, even life, superimposed on top of ours, but we cannot see it and can only detect their gravity.

This is all hypothetical, but I've always found it to be an eerie idea. This is also a proposed way to address the Dark Matter problem, though as far as I know it is not possible for mirror matter to account for all Dark Matter due to observational limits.",t3_gyr6pv,08-06-2020

58,1,fte8f5p,t1_ftdvlko,"Gravity is considered to be a distortion in the geometry of spacetime, as opposed to a traditional particle interaction, so it would make sense for gravity to be felt regardless. This is the general relativity view, at any rate.

I think this is also rather natural in quantum gravity models based on string theory, but I am not a string theorist so I am not 100% sure.

At the end of the day, because this is just a hypothesis, really you can do whatever you want and make anything the 'shared interaction' as long as you can come up with a semi-coherent mathematical description of the interactions. The other interactions like EM, weak, strong just can't be shared in the same way as gravity because they are too strong, and we'd have noticed it in our physics experiments by now.",t3_gyr6pv,08-06-2020

>""We would like to remind all visitors that access to the infinity pool is strictly for hotel guests and remains an exclusive privilege for guests staying on-property.""

>By pretending to be guests and accessing a private property without permission, these travellers might have broken several laws, say lawyers.

>Chief among them is trespassing, which the hotel can use to take action against these uninvited tourists, says police investigator-turned-lawyer Luke Lee.

>""Trespassing is a civil tort, and the hotel has the right to evict them. In this case, the police will not be involved,"" he says.

>""However, if they cause a nuisance or do anything harmful, it can potentially be criminal trespass, and the police can arrest them.""

>Criminal trespass carries a maximum penalty of three months' jail and a $1,500 fine, according to the penal code.

>Also, taking bathrobes from the housekeeping carts can be considered theft even if one returns the items later on, says Mr Lee.

>Lawyer Ravinderpal Singh says these travellers also risk breaking another law ‚Äî cheating by personation.

>""Let us say that if you enter a golf country club by pretending to be a named member, that would be impersonating the person,"" he explains.

500,1,dvdfps3,t3_82v958,"I think I have something to add here. Myself and 6 friends booked a family room for one night whilst backpacking across Asia.

Originally, because we didn't want to pay for extra adults I booked it for a couple and paid at the desk with one friend and snuck everyone in. Upon realising we couldn't all get to the pool with two cards I knew we were going to have get creative.

First of all I went back to the front desk and got kids pool cards for ""my two kids"". They asked the kids ages and I said 2 and 8. First thing to note is I'm 20 years old, so they're obviously not checking/caring enough to call your bluff on the extra kids pool cards.

Of course we still had 4 cards between 6 adults. I did some creeping and found the entrances on level 56 (If i recall correctly, if not 56 whatever level is one below the main pool level) are scanned either side of the elevators down long corridors (think a T intersection where the stem of the T is the elevator's doors and the left and right arms are the corridors to the underground change rooms/bathrooms and the stairs up to the main pool.

I would speak to the security guard near the elevators, ask directions to things and my friends would exit the elevator behind me in the robes/looking as luxe as possible and go and scan as a group using the other 3 cards. Multiple ""bleeps"" meant the guard didn't notice the bleeps didn't perfectly align the with the number of guests and we rinsed and repeated for exit.

Well if we started to hunt down people online for the reasons stated, that'd be considered stalking and harassment which you seem to be an advocate for. You creep. 

Anyway it won't be us who'll be hunting /u/haitchpea down, that'll probably be left to the MBS security and the IT department, seeing as it'll be relatively easy to trace him if he's used the free hotel WiFI. All they have to do is match the reddit post timestamps with any user who've accessed reddit on their network. Given the information that OP has so kindly provided in this post, it should be a slam dunk tbh.

Also, nowhere in any of my posts have I mentioned anything about ‚Äúforeigners stealing our power, facilities and not abiding by our rules‚Äù, so stop projecting your issues onto the majority of us.

Sorry as I do not have a direct comparison to the OG Max, but low-light performance is markedly better than the Redmi Note 4x. It tends to get kinda noisy after a certain threshold (no idea how to quantify it), but nothing that's unusable. In manual mode, noise performance is pretty decent up to ISO 400, manual focus is aided by the inclusion of focus-peaking (although it doesn't automatically disappear like the one found on the Samsung S8). Low light shots are best taken at ISO 100 with the help of a tripod and manual focusing. [Here's](https://flic.kr/p/25tqT12) a low-light shot I took a couple days back. ISO 100, 2"" shutter speed IIRC.",t3_86sy24,25-03-2018

> Two otter families have gotten into a territorial fight at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.

> Marina otters have often been caught clashing with their arch-rivals, the Bishan otters.

> However, it's not the Bishan otters this time, but the wandering Zouk family, which was recently also spotted at Little India.

> What happened?

> The Zouk family has been exploring the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park recently, beyond their usual haunt.

> An otter enthusiast, Jeff Tan, shared that May 10 was his first time seeing the seven Zouk otters visit the area.

> The curious critters did not bump into the Marina otters that day, even though they have intruded the latter's territory.

> However, two days later, Tan heard loud squeaks in the park on May 12 morning.

> The squeaks came from Marina otters, perhaps on high alert after sensing the presence of other otters.

> Swimming down the stream at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, the 10 Marina otters eventually found the seven Zouk otters near the McDonald's bridge.

> The 17 otters then got into a series of gang chant squeaking, warning the other to back off.

> The brazen Zouk otters were clearly not frightened despite being outnumbered by Marina otters, and the 17 otters got into a brawl in the bushes as the humans watched on from a distance.

> After the short tussle, the two otter families took a time out as they regrouped themselves, did a head count, and caught some rest before getting into more chases and gang chant squeaking.

> The Marina otters eventually let the Zouk otters off and went back to the waters.

> There were no casualties and no otters were caught by SPOT the safe distancing officer.

> You can watch the video here:

In the 1910s - 1930s saw the use of iron and steel in construction, and glass and thin pillars were the new thing and used to project futurism. It was a symbol against the ornamentation which was seen as greedy and excessive. Later it became symbol of corporatism and modernism and never left, and became the thing it sought to change. 

Riechstag dome is a symbol of transparency and also a rehash of the previous pre 1930s glass dome. It was To restore the parliament building to a democratic nature after being torched by Nazis back in 1930s. Parliament chamber placed at the bottom and open for viewing by all visitors. Dome also gives daylight to the chamber and represents a new optimism and transparency in a newly reunited a Germany.

Motor Yacht A (MY A) is a luxury motor yacht designed by Philippe Starck and engineered by naval architect Martin Francis. It was built by the Blohm + Voss shipyard at the HDW deepwater facility in Kiel. It was ordered in November 2004, and delivered in 2008 at a rumoured cost of US$300 million. With a length of 119 metres (390 ft) and displacing almost 6,000 tonnes, it is one of the largest motor yachts in the world.

> SINGAPORE: Six toilets in Marina Bay Sands have received the¬†six-star rating from the Restroom Association of Singapore¬†-¬†the first toilets in Singapore to be awarded its¬†top rating.

> The association had introduced the six-star rating¬†in 2014, but it was only on Tuesday (Apr 24) that any toilets here hit the mark.¬†

> Under the grading system, six-star or ""magnificent restrooms"" are expected to use¬†smart technology and employ cleaners who have completed a Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) module in washroom cleaning.¬†

> This is on top of the standards laid out under the five-star rating. Toilets under this category are expected to have facilities in working condition, provide basic amenities such as soap and toilet paper, be odour and litter-free, have a ""reasonably dry floor"" as well as include ""special delights, user-friendliness and/or eco-friendly facilities"", according to the Restroom Association.

> In one of¬†Marina Bay Sands&apos; six-star toilets, for instance, there is¬†a detector which measures the level of ammonia in the air and relays this information to cleaners via SMS.

> Once odour levels exceed a certain threshold, a text message will be sent to the cleaners with information about which toilet is affected.

>     Once odour levels exceed a certain threshold, a text message will be sent to the cleaners with information about which toilet is affected. (Photo: Revathi Valluvar)  


> The six-star toilets are also equipped with smart tablets that allow users to provide real-time feedback.

> If negative feedback is given, the programme will also send text messages¬†to the cleaner in charge so that problems can be tackled as soon as possible.

> Both these tech solutions were provided by Singapore¬†companies. Convergent Smart Technologies provided the ammonia detectors while Infinergy Systems Solutions was responsible for the feedback software.

>        The six-star toilets are also equipped with smart tablets that allow users to provide real-time feedback. (Photo: Revathi Valluvar)   

> The six-star rating is due for renewal on an annual basis.

> Speaking to reporters at the certification of Marina Bay Sands&apos; six-star toilets, president of the Restroom Association Tan Puay Hoon said it is hoped that including technological solutions in its criteria would lead to better standards and quality.

> ‚ÄúWe also hope that it (will) encourage other toilet owners to implement tech solutions to help manage their resources and manpower more effectively,‚Äù said Mdm Tan.¬†

The Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX-1) is a floating, self-propelled, mobile active electronically scanned array early-warning radar station designed to operate in high winds and heavy seas. It was developed as part of the Missile Defense Agency's Ballistic Missile Defense System.

The radar is mounted on a fifth generation CS-50 twin-hulled semi-submersible oil platform. Conversion of the vessel was carried out at the AmFELS yard in Brownsville, Texas; the radar mount was built and mounted on the vessel at the Kiewit yard in Ingleside, Texas.

1606,1,gnlx6s1,t3_lf8778,"To promote inclusivity, top tier residential property tax should be up to 28.6% of AV *(annual value).
(Annotations, pls see bottom)

Currently, the max residential property tax is only 16% at max tier. https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Property/Property-owners/Working-out-your-taxes/Property-Tax-Rates-and-Sample-Calculations/


For residential leasehold (LH) properties under 99 years, the max property tax tier shall be 22% of assessed annual value (AV) (in line with max personal income tax rate https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Income-Tax-Rates/ ) .


For freehold and LH above 99 years, an additional 30% surcharge will apply on the property tax charged, thus the total effective property tax for the grandest FH property would be effectively 28.6% of annual value.


This is because in a diverse economy there are many forms of income not adequately taxed  by the current income tax methods of assessment. These include capital and investment gains, inheritance, undeclared earnings, stock trading profits, online earnings earned offshore  etc. Singapore also has a low wage Vs capital share of GDP https://thehearttruths.com/2013/09/23/singapore-has-the-lowest-wage-share-among-high-income-countries/ thus suggesting that wealth from capital gains ought to be taxed more. Not few of these Uber expensive and massive properties also contain a treasure trove of expensive furniture and oft times, artwort, wines, jewellery and gold bullion worth much more than the property itself, since Singapore's gun free and safe environment, strong army and fast response time of home team services permits dual use of the large residence as a reliable physical wealth store.


It is thus not unreasonable to expect that the top tier of residential property taxes ought to exceed the top personal income tax bracket. (Due to lower tax levels of preceding tiers, the total tax payable shouldn't exceed 28%).


The Singapore PAP is also actively promoting rich foreign billionaires to live in Singapore https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/singapore-billionaires-saverin-brin-dyson-dalio-family-offices-14145418 the current residential property tax rates do injustice to the revenues that IRAS collects since the vast majority of Singaporeans live in LH properties and thus cannot effectively bequeath much property to their descendants, unlike the Singaporean billionaires who hold their FH property in perpetuity, thus the need for an additional FH surcharge to the ordinary LH property tax charged. Setting the top tier property tax level somewhat in stone and linked to the very competitive personal income tax levels  *(one of lowest in the world) will give these billionaires more confidence that the government is not corrupt or confused and is able to give a coherent, reasonable and sustainable explaination of the methodology of property tax charged. In addition, having a consistent property tax rate which is largely tagged to the income tax and GST rate will serve as a sustainable property cooling measure and also leverage upon Asians often times maleficent obsession with property amassment to the detriment of society (like in Hong Kong where gross inequality of access to home is prevailent) - without the need for shallow, knee jerk, economically inefficient/disruptive and unjust *property cooling measures like additional stamp duties etc which instead caused a property buying frenzy the night of its implementation. Due to the one off surcharge of stamp duty, such cooling measures only create more unpredictability and instability of the property market in the long run.


All FH property owners may at any time excuse themselves from paying the FH additional property tax surcharge by converting their land titles to LH titles.


Government will not need to raise GST as a result of this increase in property tax, in part due to the probable overall increase in tax revenues collected ( especially from massive FH properties) an in part because the greater recycling of residential properties either due to FH property tax surcharge or the sale of recycled LH land will be a renewable source of government revenue income to fund government budgets for subsequent years.


In view of the high wealth inequality in Singapore, it is suggested that the per capita 50%tile of all residential property taxes is deposited into a 'living-costs' account if each citizen under the CPF umbrella (like skills future account).


This non-withdrawal cash account can be used for government sanctioned uses like fully paying residential property taxes or property rental (for rental tenants), a portion of utility and medical bills, educational courses etc etc. Upon death or relinquishing of Singapore citizenship, the balance of savings in this account cannot be withdrawn.


PS: for retirees who are asset rich and cannot afford the increased property taxes in their very large old properties, they can opt to tenant out additional rooms, convert their land titles to LH to avoid the FH additional tax surcharge or even opt for a reverse mortgage to draw income from their wealth assets and let the next generation repay the reverse mortgage, which is normally at the low interest rate for property loans due to the a/m stable property tax regime to keep property prices in Singapore always stable and free from mad swings in prices etc. Retirees shouldn't grumble about the higher property tax rates for FH/ large landed properties because they must remember that by property value, they are probably the biggest beneficiaries of the SAF, Home team etc protecting their wealth with zero inheritance tax. As of 2019, budget for SAF, home team were $15.5B and $10.7B, despite massive costs savings from non-salaried service of citizens serving NS: these are very large costs and it is much more likely that the large sized dwelling is a discretionary item and due to Singapore's progress, their residences are worth much more now, thus the need for progressive property taxes, where by the top tier rates exceed that of the respective income tax bracket rates and the need for FH property tax surcharges to ensure the fair recycling of land for property uses in land scarce Singapore.

> SINGAPORE - Marina Bay Sands (MBS) sank deep into the red in the second quarter of this year, racking up a loss of US$113 million (S$156.5 million) after a near-three-month shutdown.

> This is compared to the US$346 million profit it made between April and June last year, MBS' parent company Las Vegas Sands (LVS) reported on Wednesday in the United States. Both figures refer to Ebitda or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.

> No layoffs were announced in LVS' press release, which said the US casino giant would continue to execute its previously announced capital expenditure programmes in both Macau and Singapore. LVS had more than 10,000 full-time employees in Singapore in 2019, it said on Wednesday.

> The $9 billion expansion plans announced by Singapore's two integrated resorts (IR) last year were called into question last week, after Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) announced that it would be laying off staff. While RWS did not confirm how many employees it let go, The Straits Times understood the number to be about 2,000.

> Both MBS and RWS said last week that they will be continuing with their expansion plans, which are slated for completion by 2023 and 2025 respectively.

> Speaking during an earnings call on Wednesday, LVS chief executive Sheldon Adelson said progress is being made on the expansion of MBS, but delays on the timing of the project are likely to occur.

> ‚ÄúThese delays are principally related to the impact of the pandemic, and we will provide additional updates in the future as conditions are continuing to evolve,‚Äù he said.

> The expansion of primarily non-gaming offerings was announced along with an extension to the exclusive rights for the two to run casinos here until the end of 2030. The Government had said the IRs would be subject to a higher tax rate on all gross gaming revenue if they failed to meet their investment commitments.

> MBS' $4.5 billion expansion includes a fourth hotel tower, an entertainment arena and additional events space.

> LVS itself swung to a net loss of US$985 million for the second quarter, compared with net profit of US$1.11 billion in the year-ago quarter. Revenue dived 97.1 per cent to US$98 million from US$3.33 billion previously, on the back on global closures of its casinos due to the pandemic.

> In Singapore, both IRs remained shut beyond the two-month circuit breaker, which began on April 7.

> Attractions, deemed to be at higher risk for transmission of the coronavirus, have been allowed to reopen from this month, subject to capacity limits and approval. Some hotels, including those at the IRs, have also been given the green light to resume operations for staycations.

> Related Story Job losses likely to hit MBS eventually, say analysts

> Related Story RWS layoffs bode ill for tourism sector

> Both IRs announced the gradual resumption of their operations earlier this month, with casino access limited to members and annual levy holders for now.

> MBS said that some venues within the complex, such as the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, theatre and Marquee nightclub would resume later, in line with government guidelines.

> Its total revenue for the second quarter plunged to US$23 million from US$688 million a year ago. Of this, casino revenue sank US$7 million from US$468 million previously. Other revenue from rooms, food and beverage, mall, convention and retail came in at US$16 million compared to US$220 million previously,

> Striking a note of optimism, Mr Adelson said in a statement that the company is seeing early stages of recovery in each of its markets, and remains optimistic about an eventual recovery of travel and tourism spending as well as future growth prospects.

> ""We are fortunate that our financial strength will enable us to continue to execute our previously announced capital expenditure programmes in both Macau and Singapore, while continuing to pursue growth opportunities in new markets,"" he said.

> SINGAPORE: There will be no fireworks display at Marina Bay on New Year's Eve to ""mitigate public health risks"" amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the organisers of the countdown event said on Thursday (Nov 5).

> Fireworks will instead be set off at various heartland locations islandwide, said the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2021 organisers.

> ""Agencies are working out details and more information will be provided in due course,"" said the organisers in a media release on Thursday.

> 

> Around the bay, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) will present two exhibitions to mark the turn of the new year: A light display illuminating the surrounding skyline as well as projection shows on the facades of three landmarks in the area - the Fullerton Hotel, the ArtScience Museum and the Merlion.

> The first display, titled Shine a Light, will showcase 60 light beams projecting from The Promontory every night from Dec 1 to Dec 31.

> Advertisement

> ""With a collective formation of light rays projected into the sky ‚Äì designed to symbolise unity, positivity and resilience ‚Äì the display represents a guiding beacon that underpins Singaporeans‚Äô spirit in navigating through the pandemic and determination to emerge stronger in the new year together as a nation,"" said the organisers.

> The second display, titled Share the Moment, is a community project that culminates in the projection mapping of shows on the facades of the three landmarks in Marina Bay.

> ""Organised in partnership with the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), the projections will feature student artworks from various local educational institutions and will take place nightly from Dec 25 to Dec 31.""

> The projection shows on the facade of the ArtScience Museum will take place nightly from Dec 26 to Dec 31.

>

> ""Inspired by stories from the City of Good ‚Äì a vision where individuals, organisations and leaders come together to give their best for others ‚Äì the projected artworks will depict moments in the past year where outstanding givers came together to uplift others in the community,"" said the media release.

> 

> HEARTLAND FIREWORKS ON TV

> The heartland fireworks and scenes from Marina Bay will be broadcast during a New Year's Eve music programme presented by Mediacorp, titled Let's Celebrate 2021. It will be shown on Channel 5 and streamed online.

> ""The programme will feature international and local talents presenting good music, dance and fashion to usher in the new year. These include collaborations between local performers and up-and-coming creative talents from the fashion and dance communities,"" said the media release.

> 

> URA's chief executive officer Lim Eng Hwee said: ‚ÄúThe Marina Bay Singapore Countdown is a highlight that Singaporeans and visitors look forward to each year.

> ""It is all the more significant this year as it marks a time to reflect on the end of a challenging year, and an occasion to usher in 2021 with new hopes.

> ""As health and safety remain a priority, we have adopted a different format to ensure that the public can celebrate safely and meaningfully. We encourage all to join the countdown at home on New Year‚Äôs Eve.‚Äù

SINGAPORE -Black Tap Craft Burgers & Beer, a New York-based restaurant helmed by Michelin-starred chef Joe Isidori, will be opening its first Asia store at¬†Marina Bay Sands (MBS) in the third quarter of the year.
Black Tap Singapore will be located in the South Promenade of The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, Black Tap and MBS said in a statement on Monday (March 19).
The Singapore menu will feature Black Tap&apos;s craft burgers, including its All-American Burger and its Greg Norman Burger. The latter, which has wagyu beef, house buttermilk-dill, blue cheese and arugula between soft potato buns, won the People&apos;s Choice Award at the New York City Wine and Food Festival&apos;s Burger Bash for three consecutive years from 2015.
Black Tap&apos;s chicken dishes include the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, Spicy Korean BBQ Wings toasted with sesame seeds, scallion and served with buttermilk-dill dressing.
Sides include its hand-cut fries and crispy brussel sprouts.
The restaurant is also known for its signature CrazyShake milkshakes, which are decadent concoctions with generous candy toppings in pops of colour.

Fate of Marina Square's Emporium Shokuhin uncertain as debt exceeds $1m

Emporium Shokuhin at Marina Square Shopping Mall owes its landlord Marina Centre Holdings rent and electricity charges of about $930,000. The landlord took possession of the 34,000 sq ft premises over the weekend and the emporium is closed.ST PHOTO: ALPHONSUS CHERN

¬†

It was billed as a mega emporium with markets and restaurants, a gourmet paradise catering to Singaporeans' love of all things Japanese, but the fate of¬†Emporium Shokuhin¬†at the Marina Square Shopping Mall now hangs in the balance.
Epicurean Concepts Marina Square, the company at the core of the emporium, filed for judicial management last week, saying it was unable to pay its debts of more than $1 million. It indicated it had a potential investor for the business, and its application for judicial management would protect it from its creditors in the meantime.
In the court filing, it said it had been in the red since it opened for business in 2015 and earnings dropped sharply after¬†Japanese discount chain Don Don Donkiopened its¬†first store here at Orchard Central in December last year.

Its main creditor, landlord Marina Centre Holdings, is owed rent and electricity charges of about $930,000, according to documents seen by The Straits Times.
Meanwhile, the landlord took possession of the 34,000 sq ft premises over the weekend. A visit yesterday found the entrance blocked off and workers putting up signs saying ""Emporium Shokuhin is closed"".
Responding to queries from ST, Marina Centre Holdings said it had taken back the tenant's premises ""due to breach of their tenancy contract"".

A spokesman said the decision was made after both parties ""tried hard and made various efforts to resolve the matters amicably"".
Emporium Shokuhin branded itself as Singapore's first integrated Japanese emporium, with a live seafood market, a beef dry-ageing facility, a Japanese gourmet grocer and restaurants. The different business aspects were handled by five subsidiaries under holding company Epicurean Concepts Holdings.

Epicurean Concepts Marina Square holds the six-year lease on the premises and ""sub-let"" them to three subsidiaries that operated the dining outlets and supermarket.
It also provided staff and administrative support to the entire group. A fifth subsidiary was responsible for procurement.
Last Wednesday, Epicurean Concepts Marina Square, represented by Mr Pradeep Pillai and Ms Joycelyn Lin from PRP Law, applied for judicial management. A pre-trial conference is fixed for Oct 11.
Interim judicial managers Andrew Grimmett and Lim Loo Khoon of Deloitte & Touche were appointed by the High Court yesterday, pending the hearing of the judicial management application. Their duties include negotiating with potential investors and the landlord, paying the salaries of essential employees and paying essential expenses.
In an affidavit, director Lim Li-Wei said the company incurs monthly liabilities of about $747,000, including $210,000 in rent and $430,000 in salaries. At the time of filing, the group had 36 part-time and 119 full-time staff.

The company's balance sheet as at Aug 31 showed current assets of about $8.5 million and current liabilities of about $10 million.
Based on accounts for the financial year ended Sept 30 last year, the company suffered losses of about $16,000, said Mr Lim.
He said the company had remaining cash reserves of about $20,000.
Since 2016, shareholders have injected fresh funds to keep the business afloat, he said. The last injection of $1.4 million was in March, after the financial situation reached ""breaking point"".
He attributed this to stiff competition from Don Don Donki, which also features a supermarket with a takeaway section offering sushi, sashimi and other Japanese ready-to-eat food, a Japanese themed bar and Japanese dining outlets.
He said there was a decline of between 20 per cent and 40 per cent in the year-on-year earnings from the dining outlets and supermarket at Emporium Shokuhin between March and last month.
The Formula 1 Grand Prix road closures also exacerbated the company's financial situation, he said.
Mr Lim said the company has been desperately trying to find a way to save the business and has found a Thai investor. He sought some ""breathing space"" until the investment comes in.

The last time I inline skated was a looong time ago so can't remember so well. I think with quads my feet feel flatter and more in its natural alignment, whereas I pronate more with inline skates. Also cus my legs are bowed so that tended to happen. I generally like the look and feel of quads a lot more! It's also part of a fashion and lifestyle thing... Inline skates are more dedicated to sport and speed in its aesthetic.

1994,1,eztvo8y,t3_d2btzi,"> # NS Square, to replace Marina Bay floating platform, slated for 2025 completion; platform to host NDP in 2020, 2021

> SINGAPORE - The project to build a new NS Square - a new, permanent space that will replace The Float @ Marina Bay - is targeted to be completed and handed over by the third quarter of 2025, according to tender documents seen by The Straits Times.

> The existing floating platform, which has been used for several National Day Parades (NDPs) in recent years, could be demolished from January 2022.

> Before its demolition, the site will host two more NDPs, next year and in 2021, announced Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen on Monday (Sept 9).

> In a Facebook post, he wrote: ""Holding NDP 2019 at the Padang was an event steeped in history and traditions. For 2020 and 2021, NDP will be held at The Float @ Marina Bay, before that site closes for a few years to be built into the new NS Square.""

> ""The Float is a unique site that, in addition to land activities, allows more air and sea assets to be deployed. Look forward to NDP 2020 and 2021,"" he added.

> Built initially as a temporary NDP venue while the new National Stadium was under construction, The Float @ Marina Bay has hosted the event nine times since 2007, most recently in 2018. The parade last month was held at the Padang.

> According to documents put up by the Ministry of Defence on government procurement portal GeBIZ in May, multidisciplinary teams who bid for the project can propose the demolition and construction sequence for the project to meet the expected handover date.

> The team that will implement the selected design proposal is estimated to be appointed by the second quarter of 2020.

> Stage 1 of the redevelopment project, the calling of an ""expression of interest"" to gather design proposals, ended in July.

> In the next stage, up to five multidisciplinary teams will be shortlisted to develop and submit design and fee proposals. At the end of this stage, one team will be appointed as the project consultant to implement the selected design proposal, said the documents.

> One of the requirements stated in the tender documents is for the new platform to have a seating capacity of 30,000 to 35,000. The current capacity is 27,000.

> There are also requirements for a waterfront sports facility at NS Square, a multi-purpose field with turfing converted from the stage area when it is not required for events, and a gym space comprising an open hall and studio spaces.

> In 2017, when Singapore marked 50 years of national service, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that the floating platform would be renamed NS Square, with a gallery that would showcase the evolution of NS.

> He also announced plans for the platform to be redeveloped and turned into a vibrant space for arts, culture and sports activities all year round.

> The new venue can be used for parades, as well as community events such as arts performances, weekend markets and the River Hongbao, PM Lee had said at a dinner reception for national servicemen to mark 50 years of NS.

> Related Story NS Square reflects central role of NS in Singapore life

> Related Story Salute to those who served NS

> Related Story Public invited to share ideas on redevelopment of The Float @ Marina Bay

> According to Mindef in 2017, the new NS Square will continue to be the venue for basic military training graduation parades and also parades for military units that complete their operationally ready national service.

> The redevelopment is also aimed at improving pedestrian connectivity and providing a continuous loop around Marina Bay.

> Organisers face several limitations as the platform was not designed for long-term use.

> Also, there are difficulties in staging events at the venue as only basic facilities are provided while access to the waterfront has also been restricted during event days, which affects public enjoyment of Marina Bay.

> Earlier this year, Mindef and the Ministry of National Development invited members of the public to submit their suggestions for the facilities and activities at the NS Square, as well as the exhibits they would like to see at a new gallery dedicated to national servicemen.

[EDIT: i make a mistake, the 2016 NDP cost 39.4 million, which is almost 2.5 times higher than hosting at floating platform (15 to 17 million). Padang is around 20 million. SG50 is 40.5 million.](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ndp-2016-at-sports-hub-to-cost-394m)",t3_d2btzi,11-09-2019

This, apparently.

Plenty of things to change, paperwork, operating procedures, signs and maps (which have probably already been ordered, even made), and then you have to get your staff and perhaps the public to remember which station code TE31 now refers to (for example). They did a network-wide renumbering once already back when Dover station opened, I doubt they'd want to do it again.

Of all the things we had to learn from the Taiwanese, though... (there's a station on the Taoyuan Airport line numbered A14a)

EDIT: And even if they wanted to do a renumbering, there's an unopened TE4a station, they could probably wait for that station to open and then renumber everything in one go.",t3_adekjp,07-01-2019

> SINGAPORE - Four people were injured on Monday evening (April 15) after a car crashed into a metal bollard along a pavement at the Marina Bay Financial Centre (MBFC).

> The car's driver, a 25-year-old man, has been arrested for causing grievous hurt by negligent act.

> Police said they were alerted to the accident at the junction of Central Boulevard and Marine Way at 6.08pm.

> Three female pedestrians and a male car passenger, aged between 35 and 46, were conscious when taken to Singapore General Hospital.

> The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) confirmed that four people were taken to hospital and said it was alerted to the accident at the junction at 6.10pm.

> The severity and nature of the injuries are not known. But it is understood that at least one victim's injuries were treated as urgent.

> An eye-witness, a lawyer who wanted to be known only as Xin Heng, said she had just crossed a pedestrian crossing along MBFC when she heard the sound of brakes screeching behind her followed by a loud bang and a woman screaming.

> Ms Xin Heng, 29, who works at MBFC, turned and saw that a car had knocked over at least one metal bollard along the pavement.

> ""If I had taken the lift later or walked 15 seconds slower, (one of the victims) would have been me,"" said the lawyer who was shaken by the accident.

> Photos provided to ST show a red car on the pavement near the MBFC tower with a large crowd gathering at the site of the accident.

> Ms Xin Heng said that among those in the crowd, some appeared to be trying to help the accident victims. ""I hope no one's hurt. I'm quite touched that (so many people) immediately went to help.""

> Mr Sufyan Selamet, 25, who was a passenger in a car that drove past the accident site around 7pm, said that he saw many police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) personnel.

> ""We saw a car that looked like it had crashed into a steel barricade, and there was definitely more than one ambulance"" said Mr Sufyan, who works as a user experience designer at a tech firm.

> ST has contacted the police for more information.
