Like Malaysia being the hub of voodoo in Shaw Bros movies back in ‘70s and ‘80. 

Shaw Bros would spammed dozens of movies of that genre in a year.  Leading to misunderstandings on the general audience; movies vs IRL.

Thailand was next after Malaysian authorities rejected upon finding out. Hence from 1980s onward, a whole shebang of Thai based voodoo themed movies.  Thailand is very particular on their country’s image especially “Kathoey”. Foreigners making movies there with negative portrayals is obviously a no-no.

Singapore I surmised is the same. 
Censorship board and STB would be upset on such portrayals.  ( My opinion)

I still enjoy Schlock movies though.
It is just LoL.

The attack at Changi airport in “Last Blood” is da boom; https://youtu.be/WE3MHSEc1WQ

But we all know anything ( in movies ) involving attacks on Singapore sometimes can be seen as negative portrayal because security here can’t be seen as like Barbrady in South Park.

You can't show corrupt officials or incompetence on the part of authorities. Public service announcements have to be shoehorned into the plot. There's very little room for moral ambiguity- baddies must be bad, goodies must be good. Only ""acceptable"" scenarios are allowed.

With all those restraints you're limited to at best mild domestic drama (cf *Tanglin*) or really broadly stereotyped drama or comedy. You'll never see a *Wire* or *House of Cards*.

To take my favorite example- imagine an *Office* style dramedy about *actual* life in NS. I was a medic and I have *always* wanted to write a comedy based in an SAF medical centre. The situations write themselves- petty rivalry between the combat medics and service medics, the senior medic Encik desperately trying to avoid work of any sort, the long-suffering MO quietly moonlighting outside camp and scared of being caught, endless procession of people khenging, shennanigans while preparing for audit.

The pay disparity between the two sides were already there before that, but the change really showed when they started to shift away from the entertainment and into the business side of things.

The fact you are willing to write a huge paragraph to supplement your ignorance and choose a facepalm award for my comment and “affirmative award for yours” is just profounding. I can see alot from your character, just from this conversation.  No seriously, wow. Im astonished.

Also, I do agree your thought on “there is only one race and it is the human race”. It is really how things should be. But “sunshine” , the real world isnt like that. The truth is discrimination and “looking down” is happening based on race. And you can only progress as a society and cure this problem when you stand up when “small”, “irrelevant” terms like this are used to describe someone of a different colour. Thats my character. You can take any govt issued identification card and there is a column which states “race”.


You dont have to be a 70 year old wizard to teach others values. Age and maturity arent the linearly related. A living example is you, who would ask me to “fuc* off” in the midst of a discussion.

> SINGAPORE: A married couple who ran two nightclubs at Boat Quay became the first to be sentenced under the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act that came into force in Singapore in 2015.

> 

> Malkar Savlaram Anant, 51, and his wife Priyanka Bhattacharya Rajesh, 31, were each sentenced on Tuesday (Feb 11) to five years and six months jail and a S$7,500 fine.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> They were also sentenced for offences under the Women's Charter.

> The couple were in November last year found guilty of exploiting their three workers and coaxing one of them into prostituting herself.

> Malkar was also ordered to pay a compensation of S$4,878.31 in unpaid salary to one of the women.

> Court documents showed the women were promised jobs as dancers at clubs Kanggan and Kickk, with a monthly salary of 60,000 Bangladeshi taka (S$982).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> But they were subjected to ""oppressive conditions"" during their time here, said Deputy Public Prosecutors James Chew and Rimplejit Kaur in their case against the duo in written submissions after a trial spanning more than 20 days.

> Malkar, who was also known as “Dada” or “Johnny” claimed trial to five charges, three under the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act (PHTA) — one for each woman he allegedly harboured by means of abuse of power for the purpose of exploitation or servitude between Dec 23, 2015 and Jun 1, 2016.

> In their case, the prosecution cited ""difficult work conditions, verbal abuse, onerous financial penalties should they decide to resign, close surveillance and tight control over their movement and communications"".

> The women were not allowed to keep the tips they earned, although dancers at both clubs were meant to generate income through customer tips. Two of them were not paid their monthly salaries.

> In sentencing them, District Judge Shaiffuddin Saruwan said: ""Both of you have played integral roles in the vice ring as main perpetrators.""

> They sourced for customers and decided the prices of sexual services, Mr Shaiffuddin said.

> He added that the couple had total control over the women who were deceived into believing they were here to work as dancers.

> They had no freedom of movement throughout their stay, and were isolated and vulnerable, he said.

> They were under psychological pressure including threats of non-payment of salary to coerce them into prostitution, he added.

> He said the operation had a transnational element to it as they procured sex workers from Bangladesh.

> ""This tarnishes Singapore's reputation"", he said, adding that such cases are difficult to detect when they are under the ""protective cloak"" of legitimate businesses.

> The couple's lawyer K Jayaram Naidu said he will be appealing against both the conviction and sentence.

> The couple, who are out on bail, will have to report weekly to a police station for monitoring purposes.

> They could have been jailed up to 10 years and fined up to S$100,000.

> For nearly 10 minutes, a drunk deliveryman repeatedly attacked an acquaintance at a Boat Quay night club in July 2016, punching his face, hitting his head with a metal chair, and even stomping on his face as he lay helpless on the ground.

>The attack left the 55-year-old victim with a broken face and skull, and bleeding in the brain. He died in hospital three days later.


>On Monday (1 October), the assailant, Thennarasu Karupiah, was sentenced to 15 years’ jail after he pleaded guilty to one charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

>Thennarasu, who turned 50 years old on 22 September, was also jailed for an additional five months in lieu of 10 strokes of the cane. Male offenders who are above 50 cannot be caned.

>The High Court heard that Thennarasu, a Singapore permanent resident, drank 14 cans of 500ml of beer at a coffee shop in Serangoon Road on the night of 12 July 2016. At about 10.30pm, he went to Taj Mahal Bollywood Music Lounge at Boat Quay to continue drinking with two friends. The trio drank two 750ml bottles of whiskey there.

>At about 4am the next day, the victim, Arokiasamy Paul Rajoo, entered the club. Thennarasu went to the balcony to smoke, and Arokiasamy went after him to speak to him there.

>The duo had known each other from the 1980s, when they were in different secret society gangs. They also met each other in prison. While in jail, Arokiasamy had the impression that they were part of the same “Sarajumbo” secret society gang, Deputy Public Prosecutors Bhajanvir Singh and Dwayne Lum told the court.

>The prosecutors played closed-circuit video footage of the assault in court.

>After an argument at the balcony, Thennarasu is seen leaving at about 4.05am and Arokiasamy follows suit. Thannarasu returns to the balcony about five minutes later, and Arokiasamy confronts him again.

>Thennarasu then tries to leave, but is tapped on his arm and called back by Arokiasamy. They then continue arguing.

>At about 4.15pm, Arokiasamy allegedly insults Thennarasu by saying “your mother did not give birth to you by one father” in Tamil, and also alludes to him being born from “10 fathers”.

>Thennarasu punches Arokiasamy’s face once, but is separated by two bystanders. Arokiasamy tries to kick Thennarasu twice, unsuccessfully. Thennarasu then kicks Arokiasamy once.

>Both men push themselves past the two bystanders, and Thennarasu throws multiple punches at the victim’s face, upper body and head as they wrestle on the ground.

>At about 4.15am, according to the CCTV footage, Arokiasamy sits on the floor with his right hand with palms open in front of him, and asks Thennarasu to stop hitting him. But the latter grabs a metal chair and hits the victim on the head, causing him to slump face down and remain motionless. As Arokiasamy lays on the ground unconscious, Thennarasu continues hitting him for at least eight times with the metal chair on the back of the upper body.

>A bystander puts Arokiasamy, still unconscious, onto a chair at the balcony. Shortly after, Thennarasu spits at the unconscious victim. He also knocks Arokiasamy off the chair and onto the floor.

>At about 4.25am, Thennarasu goes up to Arokiasamy, who raises his left hand to protect himself, as the former kicks his head. Thennarasu then stomps on the victim’s face three times.

>Arokiasamy is left sprawling face up on the floor, and remains unresponsive thereafter. Thennarasu took a taxi home.

>At about 4.30am, a bouncer and three other patrons carried Arokiasamy out of the balcony. The bouncer called for an ambulance at about 5.30am.

>Thennarasu later found out from a friend that Arokiasamy was badly injured and might die. He called a friend and asked for a place to stay in a bid to avoid the police, telling the friend that he was having problems with his wife at home. Policemen tracked him down and arrested him five days later, on 18 July 2016.

>The prosecutors asked for 16 years’ jail, with an additional five months’ imprisonment in lieu of 10 strokes of the cane. They noted the “forcefulness and ferocity of the near ten-minute long assault”.

>They also pointed to Thennarasu’s long history of violence-related crimes, stretching back to when he was 16 years old. Among other convictions, he was jailed for 13 months with six strokes of the cane in 1994 for causing grievous hurt, and jailed for 6.5 years with four strokes of the cane in 2001 for robbery with hurt.

>Defence lawyer Thangavelu asked for a jail term of between eight and 10 years. There was no premeditation, and Arokiasamy had insulted his client’s parents, said the lawyer.

>High Court judge Hoo Sheau Peng agreed with the prosecution that the attack was “vicious and brutal”.

>Thennarasu, whose sentence was backdated to the date of his remand on 18 July 2016, could have been jailed for up to 20 years, or for life.",t3_9ko8ib,02-10-2018
