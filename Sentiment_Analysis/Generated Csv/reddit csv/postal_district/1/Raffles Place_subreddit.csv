While it isn't conclusive and confirmed in SMRT's role of the damaged Floating Slab Track section, I, personally, don't believe in jumping to conclusions or blaming SMRT for the lack of maintenance, changes takes time to come.

I appreciate constructive feedback, further input or debate regarding the article and the delays.
