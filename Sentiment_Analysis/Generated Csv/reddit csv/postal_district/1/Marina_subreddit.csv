I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7uocdo/are_visitors_of_guests_allowed_in_the_pool_area/) recently asking about the strictness and terms of guests and visitors of guests using the horizon pool. I got some good but slightly mixed answers. I just arrived home from staying there so here are some up to date things to know!

1. ~~You are allocated only 2 x keys per room (I believe the pent houses/presidential suites get one extra, but 2 is the golden number)~~
This includes a card to put in the slot to power your room.
UPDATE - Confirmed by a MBS staff in the comments, as many guests that are staying in the room is the number of key cards you receive on check in.

2. You can purchase 1 x day visitor pass for 100SGD. You can only purchase 1 x visitor pass per room, per day.

3. There is no strict security when you have a room key to get to the pool or other areas. No one quiz's you on your name & room number. But saying this, if you are going to use someones key card, make sure you know the room and name just in case.

Bonus Trick: If you know someone that is kind enough to let you use both keys, I figured out a nice trick to make sure your friend has room power so you can use both key cards for the pool area!

To combat people just putting regular cards in the power holster and using both key cards for the pool area, the hotel has cut 2 little circles in each card. The holster recognises the circle as a hotel card and grants you room power. To beat this, I simply found an old card in wallet, traced a circle with a pen with the real room card, cut the hole out with nail scissors and TA-DA!

I hope this helps any tourists or even locals that want to enjoy the amazing hotel which is Marina Bay Sands!

EDIT - Grammar & words

EDIT - This blew up way more than expected, so I just want to clarify a few things.

People are acting like I have exploited a giant loophole in the system. Let me be clear, you can NOT get to the pool area without a key card. Nothing I have mentioned above sneaks/traffics more people into the pool area than intended.

Doing the trick I mentioned above with the card simply means people can stay in the room with power/air-con while others can still enjoy the use of the cards you get from the hotel. 

The trick with the card isn't so you can keep your room cool and waste power/electricity while you're away from the room.

This post is mainly for general information

It's really been a hard year for Singapore and we thought that we can create an open-world game where we can celebrate our NDP virtually and thank our frontline heroes, our SAF, the HomeTeam, and everyone in helping our nation brave through the pandemic.

We got together many of our real-life and online friends to join us to thank our frontline heroes by participating in a virtual mobile column and a virtual parade. (We try our best to be as realistic as possible by using previous years NDP footage and learning the commands for it)
