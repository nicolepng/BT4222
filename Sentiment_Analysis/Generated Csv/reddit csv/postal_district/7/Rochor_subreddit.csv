9,6,Does anyone remember the famous rainbow HDBs at Rochor Centre?,0,gtx49u,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gtx49u/does_anyone_remember_the_famous_rainbow_hdbs_at/,21,31-05-2020,"I was scrolling through this subreddit, and I noticed that a user had uploaded a picture of Tanglin Square, with a caption saying it was going to be demolished in a few years.

And wah, it immediately got me thinking of the rochor HDBs. A while back it was the defacto place for hipsters and photoshoot. I bet many of us have that one iconic shot right in the middle of the four blocks. 

It's really a shame that it was taken down tho. I'ld argue that they were **the most** beautiful HDBs in SG.

So, what are some memories you guys have with the place?"
