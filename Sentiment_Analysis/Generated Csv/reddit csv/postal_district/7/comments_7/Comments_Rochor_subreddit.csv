113,6,e8ado2r,t1_e87xh6x,"This typology of HDB flats was introduced post-independence and are vastly different from others found outside the city. Influenced by the Brutalist and Japanese Metabolist movements, mixed used developments that are in itself a self-contained ecosystem were aspirational. We thrived for vibrancy not just in the city, but within buildings themselves. People's Park, Golden Mile, Bukit Timah Plaza / Shopping Centre, Beauty World are contributions from the private sector side to these movements. In public sector, there's Rochor Centre, Bras Basah Complex, Waterloo Centre, Tanjong Pagar Plaza and Upper Cross Street HDBs. There are a few more, but these are off the top of my head. These buildings were our first experiment when we became independent, and you can attribute the normalisation of mixed used developments to them (compared to European / American cities, our buildings are rarely used for singular purposes).

To me, we are at an awkward crossroad where pre-independence shophouses and SIT flats are adored (and statutorily conserved), but post-independence developments are considered an eyesore. Conservation efforts, first and foremost, should always start from high-level. We know that we cannot do much about private developments (after all, they are mostly 99 years leasehold, owners want to sell for en-bloc, what can government do without coming across as draconian). But, this problem ideally shouldn't exist with public developments. Drastic measures to dictate conservation for buildings of historical significance should ideally, be easy to implement in public buildings. Yet, it is not. Conversely, it became the convenient scapegoat to ease traffic congestion and placate the common people. On the left is Kampong Glam conservation district. On the right are private developments. For every architectural historian, there are 10 others who complain about Bukit Timah Road's congestion. What can we do?

I think we always overlook that back then moving into HDBs like this would *definitely* have been befuddling. Entire communities were thrown together and had to learn new ways of living. In no way were those simpler times. 

We can definitely cherish the memories of these iconic old HDB estates but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that in the 60s and 70s these were stunning experiments in cutting-edge urban development. ",t3_9q8wv9,22-10-2018

To make way for Singapore‚Äôs eleventh expressway, residents at Rochor Centre will be offered relocation benefits similar to those offered under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS). They will have the opportunity to move to a new, 99-year lease home and will be given a package comprising compensation and rehousing benefits.

>A spokesperson for HDB also told Channel NewsAsia that Rochor residents must move out of their flats by the end of this year. As part of the acquisition package, they are assured of a replacement flat at Kallang Trivista.

228,6,fsexx7y,t3_gtx49u,Yes. I used to study at NAFA and would always see them whenever I went to eat around the area. Once went to the ntuc there to get some stuff. I remember it being quite empty even way back then (about 4 years ago),t3_gtx49u,31-05-2020
229,6,fseydb4,t3_gtx49u,"I had many memories of the place cuz I was a student of a kindergarten there throughout most of my entire pre-school childhood several decades ago when it still had its dull paint job (man I feel old). And since I lived nearby, I commonly frequent there with my family for grocery shopping trips post-preschool.

Of all the memories I had, the one I remembered the most was of me returning back to kindergarten after the teacher let us play at the playground, when a bird shat on my head. It was also the first and only time in my life that happened to me.

Thank you birds of Rochor Centre for helping me gain a life achievement that I do not want, as well as, of all other memories, securing that as my ""most memorable"" memory of the place...",t3_gtx49u,31-05-2020

I remember we had Thai and Indian(?) workers back in the 90s 'cos when they were working in the estate, they would regularly come asking for drinking water with the 1-litre plastic soft drink bottles.",t3_gtx49u,31-05-2020
