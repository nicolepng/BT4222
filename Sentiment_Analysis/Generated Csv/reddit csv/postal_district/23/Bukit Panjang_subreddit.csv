But it didn't really sound like rain. I open curtain and it's freaking wind. The tress all shaking like mad and are causing the rustling sound and like legit I saw so many clothes falling and plastic bags going up super high. 

Some spooky shit lmao. I also see lights on the opposite block turning on and silhouettes on the windows. Looks like I'm not the only one woken up. Damn cold also. Guessing it'll rain like hell later.

edit: rain started at 00:45, probably gonna be floods tomorrow judging by how progressively heavy it's getting."

Hi, trying my luck here to recover my switch. Had a long day last night and might have misplaced my switch on bus 972, 11.20pm while alighting at opposite Fajar station.  

I’ve lodged lost item report to SMRT, but by chance if anyone have come across it, please let me know!

It’s has blue-red controllers with the game Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in it. It’s kept in a black and red colour pouch.

Thanks again!"
