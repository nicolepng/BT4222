20,23,gfowlxk,t1_gfowjov,"**[Sunda flying lemur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunda flying lemur)**

The Sunda flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) or Sunda colugo, also known as the Malayan flying lemur or Malayan colugo, is a species of colugo. Until recently, it was thought to be one of only two species of flying lemurs, the other being the Philippine flying lemur, which is found only in the Philippines. This species can be found throughout Southeast Asia ranging from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, southern Vietnam, southern Burma, and Singapore.The Sunda flying lemur is not a lemur and does not fly. Instead, it glides as it leaps among trees.

Btw curious + kaypoh so may I ask if this was a self-organised night picnic or is there some event going on?",t3_edpsk7,21-12-2019
33,23,fbjrukk,t3_edpsk7,Is that near the car park next to salvation army?,t3_edpsk7,21-12-2019
34,23,fbju6va,t1_fbjoomt,"Yup, still waiting on the answer.

Oh no. I just went there by myself. Figured it’ll be nice to experience it, and watch the stars where there is less light. I’m a loner, so... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",t3_edpsk7,21-12-2019
35,23,fbjtuqk,t1_fbjrukk,"Ah yes, actually. It’s the closest to the mrt station, so...",t3_edpsk7,21-12-2019
36,23,fblu6oz,t1_fbju6va,"how was it?

I actually wanna see stars too, and I've always been thinking about where I can go in SG to do that",t3_edpsk7,21-12-2019
37,23,fbjute1,t1_fbjtuqk,Thought that building looked familiar. Did you make your way up to the quarry viewing point?,t3_edpsk7,21-12-2019
38,23,fbm5v0i,t1_fblu6oz,"Oh yes, you could see quite a bit of stars, once you enter the quarry. It is... just more than usual, because despite being supposedly secluded, the quarry is still close to residential areas - there is still light pollution. I could still hear motorbikes zooming in a distance, because of this proximity.

The path to the quarry is pitch dark, though, might want to be careful about that. I would recommend going there with a loved one, maybe around 10-11?",t3_edpsk7,22-12-2019
39,23,fbjvuve,t1_fbjute1,"Ah, no, actually. I went up there, and realised that I got on the wrong track, so, I actually turned around and made my way to the dairy farm quarry instead.",t3_edpsk7,21-12-2019
40,23,fbm6avw,t1_fbm5v0i,Do you have an exact location for it? Might be down for some night sky photography.,t3_edpsk7,22-12-2019
41,23,fbmhs4u,t1_fbm5v0i,"oh man what

so it's like a dirt path, no streetlights?

do you happen to have a pic (of the sky)?

that sounds super cool but I am scared of stuff...sigh",t3_edpsk7,22-12-2019
42,23,fbmce0d,t1_fbm6avw,"Well, it’s just the quarry in general. I was there for a picnic, so I was in the open field.",t3_edpsk7,22-12-2019
43,23,fbmmafa,t1_fbmhs4u,"Yes. There aren’t any streetlights, which is actually part of why it makes for a good spot for solitude. If you’re heading there, I would recommend company, to stave away the fear of the unknown because of the darkness.

Though, unfortunately, I only had my phone, so, there wasn’t really anything I could show. Hold on... I can only compare the day and night of it. The last pic was all I could take of the sky. You’ll have to be there to see it, I’m afraid.

45,23,fc2ivy2,t1_fc2hh9f,"Ahh, haha, thanks for asking.

I had a loaf of bread I made myself, and some berries (in the bowl). For drinks I brought a thermos, and had a cup of chamomile tea, yes.

Right now, it is not a lot, but as I progress, I hope to be able to cook and bring more to my picnics.
