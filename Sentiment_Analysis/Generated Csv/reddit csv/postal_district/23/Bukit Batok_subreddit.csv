2,23,I took the MRT at Bukit Batok today and was left absolutely seething.,356,kt682p,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/kt682p/i_took_the_mrt_at_bukit_batok_today_and_was_left/,44,09-01-2021,"I am appalled by the choices SMRT has made when operating this station. This is an old, well-established station, and a nice looking one too. Unfortunately, SMRT has managed to bungle up the station's traffic flow so much so I was left with an unpleasant feeling in both my mouth and groin for the entire day. After ruminating on the issue, I have decided to share the topic with you fellas.

Before we begin, I had the privilege to contact an LTA architect and acquired the MRT's [blueprints] (https://i.imgur.com/D08gGh7.png). 

Do note the three exits. The top one is seldom used and sees the least traffic. The one to the left sees a fair amount of traffic, going towards the bus interchange as well as a cluster of shops. By far the busiest tract is the one to the bottom, where West Mall beckons, as well as another route off to shops, HDBs, and other places people would like to go to.

With that in mind, please take a look at this excellent overlay I drew over the blueprint to denote the [traffic flow] (https://i.imgur.com/oWgBqGM.png).

Pay close attention to the overlapping lines, denoting an unruly mess of crowds congealing together. There are two reasons why the traffic flows like this and why I was so infuriated by this station.

1. They decided to group the gantries on either side of the service counter by exit/entry. Facing the exit, the group on the left is exit only, while the right is entry only. This means the entire flock of people entering from the mall and residential must shove their way through an endless stream of people excited to touch down in Bukit Batok. This is also a Covid hazard, this really cannot be allowed!

2. For some reason, the escalators are also the wrong way round. Again facing the exit, the escalator at the back and positioned more to the right is downwards-heading, meaning people exiting will need to switch to the otherside of the concourse to exit. This is only a mild inconvenience, until you realise what it means for the upwards-heading escalator. Anyone entering will have to cross the staircase after passing the gantries in order to reach the escalator, meaning another cross-stream with people coming down the stairs. You could immediately turn at the gantries, crossing straight up along the service counter, but I did not see anyone do this and it's frankly ridiculous, because you'd be the only one fighting against the stream of people heading out.

As you can see, simple controllable gantries and escalators have completely ruined the useability of the station, causing frustration, opportunities for perverts to cop a feel, as well as for sweaty limbs to mingle.

After racking my brains for all of 30 seconds, I have come up with this [brilliant solution] (https://i.imgur.com/p5YF60y.png). You'll still get some cross-stream in the mid-section, but otherwise the station will be much more pleasant to stroll around. There'll also be no need to switch sides on the concourse. You simply head straight from the gantry/escalator, and thus meaning you can spend longer gawking at your phone without looking up.

I sincerely hope the SMRT CEO will chance across this Reddit post and share with his board during Monday's meeting, so my next visit here will be smoother.

Thank you for attending my TED Talk."

14,23,Bukit Batok Nature Parks -- An Unchanged Problem from 2003,114,ka8g06,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ka8g06/bukit_batok_nature_parks_an_unchanged_problem/,30,10-12-2020,"You may have seen the news lately about petitions and efforts to conserve the area known as [Bukit Batok Hillside Park](https://www.change.org/p/housing-development-board-of-singapore-hdb-support-conservation-of-bukit-batok-hillside-park-to-ensure-a-sustainable-future-for-us), a 17 hectare area located among surrounding developments near the Bukit Batok area, most of which were only constructed in the last decade. 

There was a [recent news report that seemed to indicate](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-bukit-batok-nature-parks-raise-ecological-connectivity-between-bukit-timah-nature) that environmental ministers have designated two areas, one of which is located in the original area highlighted by the petition, as ""nature parks"", which National Development Minister Desmond Lee has promised that this park will remain ""*rustic*"" and the National Parks Board will seek ways to enhance the biodiversity within these two areas.

However, there is a problem. These areas are **not** new. Apart from the addition of a small arm connecting the park to Bukit Batok West Avenue 9, both parks were already designated as parks in URA Master Plans since *2003*. As seen in [this image](https://i.imgur.com/B75IZdp.png) of the 2003 master plan, all of the 16 hectare Central Nature Park and most of the 9 hectare Hillside Nature Park conserved was already planned by then. No plans were installed due to this petition, just tweaked. This does not meet the original demands in the petition started by Jimmy Tan, who requested for the *entirety* of the current area, bounded by Bukit Batok West Avenue 2, Avenue 5 and Bukit Batok Road, to be conserved and free from development. However, there are still multiple residential areas slated for development and construction in that area, and only a bit more than *half* of the area earmarked by the petition will be conserved.

So, what's the issue here? They saved some of the area what? They even added on to existing plans! Celebrate, right?

...not really. There are problems here that I'll highlight, from Singapore's overall rhetoric on nature and development to issues that may directly arise from destroying natural areas for development. Even as I cover multiple sources, do note, this is **not exhaustive** of all the things about Singapore and environmental conservation.

*****

As indicated by Desmond Lee in the report, the rhetoric for environmental conservation is based on the lines of ""**Where development cannot be avoided,** we aim to carefully manage the possible environmental impact, and develop and implement suitable mitigation measures.” I personally bolded that bit, highlighting that even in his message of environmental conservation, development was placed as a *priority*. Obviously, the term 'development' carries with it various meanings to be explored in its own context, but in Singapore's context, this generally means development in terms of housing, industrial and commercial areas.

This statement highlights how, currently, those in power could justify the destruction of environmental areas through pushing a singular idea of development and **justify** it under the idea of 'growth', placing current forested areas at risk. Through multiple 'justifications', forested land in Singapore is being depleted bit by bit, and this carries wide-ranging effects. From affecting micro-climates, wherein temperatures can differ by as much as **8 degrees Celsius** (Chatterjea, 2012) to overall climate efforts in the nation and the region, wherein such development negates any existing efforts to meet climate goals, which in itself are considered ""highly insufficient"" by the [Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/singapore/).

Additionally, this highlights how the government, as a whole, has not sufficiently responded to calls by climate activists young and old, that call on the government to change their rhetoric on climate action. From those using love to express to those in power to instill a system of care for the climate and those most affected by climate change, to those taking more direct action and highlighting the flaws in current systems, they're silenced in two ways. One is directly shutting them down through other state mechanisms, like how [Fridays for Future SG](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/two-singaporeans-being-investigated-for-allegedly-taking-part-in-public) were questioned for two separate, one-person assemblies, leading to the ridiculous case of [Jolovan Wham being charged for putting up a smiley face in public](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55068007) to show solidarity for them. The second, though, is more often used and most indicative here in the Bukit Batok Nature Park case, wherein public opinion is taken in, but only as an afterthought to tweak currently existing plans, and suppresses public ideas that call for wider, systemic change.

To combat this, Singapore needs to look at development from more than just an economic development standpoint, which inherently encourages extraction from the environment, creates unequal effects for different residents on Earth ([like how Myanmar's farmers are losing their livelihood due to Singaporean efforts to reclaim land](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-sand-singapore-insight-idUSKBN20R0C1)) and considers nature as second to development (Neo, 2007). Instead, we should take in more holistic indicators of development, like indicators of happiness, social equality, natural conservation, as a *priority* rather than an afterthought.

*****

Those are overall concerns on development, but looking at the Bukit Batok Nature Park itself, there are overall problems to address. Not just in the destruction of natural habitat in areas slated for HDB development, but also potential threats to nature *within* these parks itself.

Some of you may recall fairly recent incidents of wild boars in Singapore [encroaching on urban areas](https://mothership.sg/2020/06/wild-boar-charge-singapore-island-country-club/) and ""threatening"" Singaporean citizens through heinous acts like food stealing, property destruction and posing injury risks as they attack people. Most of this framing paints wild boars as animalistic and a threat to Singaporean society.

Well, we're just looking it from our side. With swathes of urban development in the island, we ourselves are 'stealing' their food, destroying their 'property' and threatening 'violence' against them. 

With the destruction of their habitat, we are seeing a rise in human-animal encounters in Singapore. While some of these encounters **do** seem to help in the conservation and care for some animal species (see: otters), a number of animal and plant species are seen as animalistic and **unwanted**, even though we encroached on their land first without any permission from these animals. The lack of consideration for the viewpoint of the animal leaves their viability in urban life up to the human imagination of  these animals (Yeo & Neo, 2010). Some are seen as 'cute', like otters, and thus stay even when they encroach into human areas (which, let's be honest, is perfectly okay for any animal to do). Others, though, are seen as an annoyance and pest, and efforts are taken to 'remove' them from not just urban areas, but areas considered ""natural"" but are really just used as parks for human consumption (Khew, 2014; Chatterjea, 2012). We basically become colonizers of nature's land, occupying where animals live and either chasing them out or relegating them as unimportant.

Additionally, there presents some very real risks with human interaction with these 'conserved' areas. By converting a section of wild forest into a ""nature park"", there will be some pathways inevitably constructed in these areas. However, as studies by Chatterjea (2012), pathways **within** existing nature reserves in Singapore are already found to be destructive to their immediate surroundings by affecting the characteristics of soil, which can lead to lower biodiversity as the habitat of smaller animal and plant species get affected (*which leads to knock-on effects in the food chain*). Additionally, changing soil properties can lead to unnatural water run-off properties of the soil, which may lead to soil erosion and flooding, threatening nature in the park as a whole.

Additionally, the very construction of nearby housing estates could not only lead to sharp rises in temperature within a *small* pocket of forest, but also presents more immediate risks, like the threat of landslides in man-made hills (Chatterjea, 2011), which is no doubt a danger for Bukit Batok's **Hillside** Park, wherein man-made effects to slopes needs to be taken with extreme caution.

And do note, I've only focused on the area highlighted in the petition. This does not look into the other Central Nature Park, which is already a natural area around an MRT Tunnel, and the threats of human encroachment into pre-existing natural areas not manicured for human use. This does not look into the **massive** problem of Tengah, an entire forest being destroyed for a 'green town', which presents its own problem of greenwashing the destruction of an area of significant importance in terms of biodiversity and as a green lung to Singapore. 

And these are just some issues that relate to Singapore and the climate. I haven't focused on petrochemicals at all. I haven't focused on how Singapore's transition to green technologies are needlessly axing low-wage workers from jobs. I haven't focused on the intersectionality between the climate crisis and different identities, from gender to class and nationality. There's lots more to tackle.

*****

Again, this ain't exhaustive. I can't cover everything, but I hope I've introduced and laid out problems for y'all to examine and see for yourself. I haven't explained some things fully, like how 'justification' works in the era of man-made climate change (*I would suggest Dalby, 2013, but fuck me that paper is so complex it hurts my head just thinking about it*), nor have I covered ALL the possible issues that can arise from here. 

This just highlights how problems exist in our current ways of living and our ideas of success and how the environment is paying for it. I haven't covered how change is possible, and in Singapore, where everything functions top-down, it's hard. But its possible. I think so, at least. As long as we band together, highlight the wider, systemic issues, and discover for ourselves alternative and more caring ways of living, then we can not only create change for ourselves, but create systems that is more inclusive, more caring, and more sustainable for us and our surrounding environment.

49,23,Lost dog seen at Bukit Batok Rd,10,aobtvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aobtvd/lost_dog_seen_at_bukit_batok_rd/,1,08-02-2019,"Has anyone lost a dog at Bukit Batok Rd at the junction where you turn left to get to BBDC? Couldn't really see from afar and at the speed, so I don't know the gender, nor did I manage to get a picture, but it looked like a Golden Labrador Retriever mix, medium to large sized, bushy tail but shorter coat than a usual Golden. Coat is dark yellow on top to a creamy belly. It has a red collar. Dog looks to have been recently lost. Still can't see the ribs so it's not starving yet, and no limping or any major injuries, and the coat still looks fine and smooth. Of course I can't see anything beneath the coat from afar.

He's not taking it at BBDC so is it the same case for BBDC?
