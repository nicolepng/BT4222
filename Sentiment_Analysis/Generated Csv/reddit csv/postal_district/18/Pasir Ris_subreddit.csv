Seeing that we're not Chinese, me and my family decided to spend a relaxing day at Pasir Ris Park. We bought a mat, snacks, frisbee, you know, the usual picnic stuff. When we reached the park, it was sometime after lunch in the afternoon (don't quite remember the exact time) and we ready for a day of relaxation under the sun.

Just about then, low tide had set in causing the shoreline to recede quite a bit, exposing sand filled with seashells, hermit crabs and even the odd mussel shell. I had decided to venture into the shore. 

About 10 minutes later, I saw a man buried waist deep in what appeared to be some black mud-like substance. He wasn't sinking any further but I could tell he was anxious and was struggling to pull himself out. In a moment of brainfade, I stepped nearer to him and bam; found my legs sinking into the disgusting sand. I was probably knee deep in the muck and every moment I made  would suck me deeper. Eventually me and the other guy got an all fours and crawled/pulled our way out of the quicksand. My shoes and shorts were covered into black muck.

All in all it was a pretty surreal experience. I don't think there was any risk at any point because it only pulls you about waist deep. The danger probably only comes in during high tide when the water obscures the quicksand and you can quickly get pulled below the water level.

TL;DR : Got pulled into quicksand at beach, ruined my shoes and shorts."

83,18,Could anyone help me with some advice? I want to put in a requisition for a dog run in the park I live close to (Pasir Ris park). How do I go about doing such a thing?,4,bi9zm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bi9zm2/could_anyone_help_me_with_some_advice_i_want_to/,5,28-04-2019,"Dogs are allowed on a leash, but it would be so great if there was an open space available for dogs to mingle with other dogs and be off a leash! The closest such facility is about 2km away and it would be so much better if one was closer to where I live, and Pasir Ris park is pretty big - it would be an ideal spot considering so many people walk their doggos there."

LTA had better impose stricter measures on curbing reckless riding soon. More frequent spot checks would help, especially in the evenings when these punks seem to be most active. Just imagine if it had collided into an elderly person or young child..."

Go or no go?,2,7vvrip,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7vvrip/pasir_ris_central_hawker_centre_go_or_no_go/,6,07-02-2018,Been a couple weeks since they publicly launched this hipster place with young hawkers. Seldom have a reason to go that far East except to and fro the airport. Any reviews or reccos for the food there? Last heard the Yishun one was a flop so am not thaaaaat keen but a couple of reviews might twist that view. TIA!

89,18,Bunch of keys found at Pasir Ris Park,0,coukj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/coukj6/bunch_of_keys_found_at_pasir_ris_park/,3,11-08-2019,"Found at 5:30 am on the 11th of August close to the bridge between area 1 and area 2. 

They're housed in a brown leather key pouch. DM me with a description of them and I'll pass them to you, meetups preferably in Pasir Ris.

That said, does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do with them? I couldn't find a Pasir Ris Park lost and found or main office. Was thinking I'd hand them to the nearest police post, but it's really not that close by at all."
