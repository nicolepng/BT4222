She then told me to buy her a pack of rice, so I went ahead to the cai png store which was located right beside the drop off point with her. I told her to tell them what she wanted but she didn’t want to, and pulled me to the side and insisted that I ordered for her. I was kinda weirded out at this point and I knew something was up but eh I was just silent cause I was confused. So she had no choice but to choose her dishes, I noticed the worker was angry or pissed off, couldn’t tell, and that just added on top of my suspicions. Once we were done, she pulled me away and told me to hand her the food, wished me good luck, asked for my name and where I lived. I only told her my first name and said there was no need to return me the money (at this point I just wanted to get it over with and get my dinner). She kept wishing me good luck and I was already weirded tf out, wonder if she cursed me lol. After she walks away I return to the food store and asked the lady working there if she knew who the old woman was. She said the old woman goes there every night, and had just had dinner earlier before speaking to me. She asks for money and when her “victim” is unable to help her in that way, she makes them buy her a meal, and then throws it away or something (that’s what the lady working there said). Said she has an evil heart and she couldn’t say anything to me while she was ordering because she didn’t wanna be rude. The old lady was kinda touchy and stuff with my arms, despite there being the whole coronavirus thing going around. Did I just get taken advantage of? Probably, but oh well, it was a few dollars so meh, don’t really care. Just watch out for her and ignore her if you’re in Tampines MRT.

Oh and I know this post is a mess, I’m literally typing this as I’m walking to get my dinner, sorry."

Does anyone know what I can do next? Are there any rescue places for birds near tampines or east side? The bird may be injured by the way so if you know anyone that’s lost a lovebird recently and you can PM us with proof that the bird can be theirs then pls do send us a message. 

Please describe what colour the bird is, how old and gender. If the description matches we will message you back. 

Otherwise can someone help me find the bird a type of shelter, the bird is really sweet but a bit scared for now."

Having been a resident of Tampines for 19 years, I have come to embrace the town council logo that has silently stuck with us throughout this period of time. I have always loved how this logo embodies everything that Tampines is about - a developed HDB estate surrounded by lush greenery with the bright yellow sun symbolising the positive spirit shared together among Tampines residents. Yet, I do believe that it is about time that this logo undergoes a redesign that would be suited for the future both in terms of its aesthetic as well as design specifications. With the redesign, I sought to ensure that the logo would be simpler yet noteworthy at the same time by removing unnecessary details and keeping the same core design elements that have made the original town council logo iconic and lovable. Furthermore, a simpler and clearer logo would be more optimized for viewing on online platforms and electronic devices where the size of logos are scaled down significantly from their poster and signboard siblings. 

tldr i got the urge to redesign the tamp town council logo and hence I present to you my draft redesign

feel free to share your thoughts or any parts of the logo u think I should improve on I welcome any suggestions since I gotta say my logo's still far from polished."

I will be working near the Changi Shipayard, and we are looking at living in the Tampines area.

So I was wondering if people could me how Tampines is overall, how the MRT is going to close to Changi? Also we are wondering how the schools are in the area as well? What is the situation in regards to getting a vehicle and a Nanny?"
