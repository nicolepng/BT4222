In contrast, Stalinist architecture was more of a response to constructivism. It is made from mostly brick with stucco finish with appearances as you mentioned in ur earlier comments.

> Even though we have now well and truly left 2020's festivities behind, it seems one cat in Singapore is determined not to let go of the holiday vibes.

> In a Jan. 18 post on the Singapore Missing Cats Facebook group, a man appealed to that cat's owners, saying he had found the feline at Tampines Street 45.

> He attached a picture of the cat, its ginger fur largely covered by the blue Hawaiian shirt it was wearing.

> Cute or dangerous?

> The post has since garnered over 600 shares, presumably due in part to how cute (and absurd) it is to see a cat that would look more at home in a Bali beach bar rather than the Singapore heartlands.

> This sentiment was echoed by commenters:

> However others warned that clothing the cat could be potentially dangerous:

> The man who posted the photo seemed to agree with those who were worried for the cat.

> He replied in the comment section that he had attempted to undress the feline, but was stopped by its constant hissing.

> Eventually he managed to undo its top button.

> Should cats be clothed?

> A quick Google search shows that opinion is split on whether cats — or any animal — should be clothed.

> Some embrace it for how adorable it seems to make their pets, or how it can help to curb bad habits that pets may have such as scratching or plucking their fur.

> Others wrote that adding a layer of clothing over an animal's fur could cause it to overheat or cause the pet some level of discomfort.

> Chinese New Year is just around the corner, and many Chinese families have been bustling with activity to spring clean and decorate their homes.

> One unlikely Singaporean however, has decided to chip in during this festive period.

> Abdullah bin Abdul Rahman has spruced up the entire corridor outside his flat at Blk 117 Tampines St 11 with red and gold, out of his own goodwill.

> Thanking his neighbours

> Speaking to Mothership, the 36-year-old shared that helping to decorate the area was a gesture of gratitude on his part to his neighbours.

> After his father's passing in December 2020, the family had been staying at his sister's house instead.

> While they were absent, his neighbours helped to water his plants and keep the corridor clean.

> ""Like kampung style, people here are very nice, so I wanted to say 'thank you' to them,"" Abdullah said.

> Additionally, many of his neighbours are elderly.

> Thinking that climbing up and down to paste and tape the decorations on walls and ceilings would be much too tedious for the old folks, Abdullah decided to take on the task of decorating himself.

> ""And the [Year of the Ox] is actually my birth year,"" he quipped.

> Asks Chinese friends and shopkeepers for help

> Of course, buying the decorations have earned Abdullah some curious remarks, as an atypical customer.

> ""You Malay can do ah?"" — was one of the questions a shopkeeper asked him.

> To which he responded: ""'Why cannot do?' I say. Nothing wrong, this is all culture, not religion.""

> Fortunately, upon explaining the reason behind buying Chinese New Year decorations, the shopkeepers reacted with happiness at what he was doing, Abdullah said. Some have even given him decorations for free.

> But how does he choose the decorations, especially those adorned with Mandarin text?

> Aside from getting advice from shopkeepers, Abdullah says that whenever he picks out or uses the decorations, he will message a Chinese friend for help — ""like this wording, is it supposed to be on the left or right?""

> It seems that this initiative Abdullah started is a whole-of-community effort, with various people from the neighbourhood supporting him.

> ""Doesn't mean that Chinese can only do for Chinese New Year, Malay can only do for Hari Raya, Indian can only do for Deepavali,"" he said.

> Decorates in his free time

> Abdullah shares that he first started putting up the decorations in mid-January.

> As he works full-time at a pet shop, he has been doing this bit by bit in his free time.

> The corridor outside his unit is festooned with red fairy lights, faux red flowers and dangling pineapple decor.

> Another corridor is also adorned with red tasseled decorations at regular intervals.

> Abdullah was quick to assure me that the decorations are not yet complete, and that he will be done by the coming Monday.

> Despite the sizeable number of ornamentations Abdullah has garnered, he shares that he only spent around S$100.

> However, money is no issue for Abdullah. After all, the only thing he wants is for ""the people to be happy, that's all, [especially] during this kind of period, where people can't go out.""

> And clearly, his efforts have paid off.

> ""The ah ma and ah gong were so happy!"" Abdullah exclaimed. His Malay neighbours on the same floor have been quite encouraging as well.

290,18,gm9wase,t1_gm97p28,"But if there's a stall run by a Muslim that isn't Halal certified, why is it relevant to mention that it's Muslim owned? I guess that assumption is that if it's Muslim owned it's fine for Muslims to eat even if they don't have certification? But that defeats the point of the certification system. It also isn't a guarantee, for example a Muslim owner could still serve non-Halal food if his kitchen staff are all non-Muslim.

I just think it's weird. You know, you never see ""Sikh owned"" or ""Christian owned"" or anything so singling Muslim owned businesses out specifically is odd. I think something like ""the stall owner has indicated their food complies with Islamic dietary standards"" would communicate the same message and seem less discriminatory.",t3_ldtxhw,06-02-2021

293,18,gmafnul,t1_gm9wase,"It's exactly for that reason. Not all vendors are able to afford Halal certification but many Muslims would be comfortable enough to eat at such a place as long as they are owned and/or managed by Muslims themselves (they would be confident that the proprietors of such a place would fully understand what goes into making their food halal).

If let's say a non-Muslim vendor were to merely ""indicate"" that their stall complies with Islamic dietary standards (e.g. _no pork, no lard_), there's no way for a Muslim patron to know for sure if that person understands all the nuances behind what makes food ""halal"" (spoiler alert: it's more than just _no pork, no lard_), and understandably so. Even the actual halal certification process acknowledges this by requiring there to be Muslim personnel on the premises at all times.

Many places who aren't Muslim-owned and are not willing to pay for halal certification but still wants Muslim patronage attempt to get around this by hiring Makciks in tudungs to run their stall. But even this practice is seen right through by Muslim patrons as most who aren't sure just go up to the Makcik and ask.

In places around the world where dietary certification is even less of a thing, the proprietorship of the business is what people look to, e.g. Jewish-owned delis for kosher meat etc.

295,18,gmaj5ap,t1_gmafnul,"Thanks for your perspective. I understand it, but I also don't love the way in which it implicitly segregates dining establishments. Food is a huge part of SG culture, and while I can understand that different groups have their own dietary restrictions, I just think doing it by ownership sends the wrong message.

It can create notions like: Do Chinese/Indians have a problem eating at Muslim-owned stalls? Or do Muslims have a problem eating at non-Muslims' stalls even if they are compliant with the dietary standards? It creates the impression of prejudice where none may exist. It's like the ""black-owned business"" craze in the US. It just creates the idea that people aren't comfortable doing business with other races.

Lastly, I knew a half-Malay ""Muslim"" dude who was a notorious Bak Kwa eater. Just because someone is Muslim on paper, doesn't mean they know or care about any part of Islamic doctrine. For me, telling me someone was Muslim wouldn't give me confidence that he knew what he was doing.

297,18,gmamlbd,t1_gmaj5ap,"I can understand and empathise that many non-Muslims find the phrase _Muslim-owned_ weird and a little iffy. But rest assured that the term is really only for dietary peace of mind, so to speak, and nothing much else.

>It can create notions like: Do Chinese/Indians have a problem eating at Muslim-owned stalls?

Why do you think it creates that notion? I've never met a non-Muslim who's had a problem with eating at a Muslim-owned stall.

>Or do Muslims have a problem eating at non-Muslims' stalls even if they are compliant with the dietary standards?

The problem that many Muslims face is how would they know if these stalls are compliant if they aren't certified? I (and I'm sure many other Muslims) are constantly seeking out new food to eat (having these strict dietary restrictions, we always love it when something usually non-halal decides to get halal certification).

>It creates the impression of prejudice where none may exist. It's like the ""black-owned business"" craze in the US. It just creates the idea that people aren't comfortable doing business with other races.

Once again, the term Muslim-owned is used purely for practical dietary purposes, and nothing more malicious. True, many Muslims would often be a little prejudiced and apprehensive when being invited to have (for example) Japanese food, but tell them that it's halal certified or Muslim-owned and watch as the apprehension evaporates away. The only reason Muslims aren't comfortable doing business with food vendors that don't serve halal food is because those vendors don't serve halal food. It really _is_ that straightforward.

I'll be happy to use and normalise a different term amongst my Muslim circles that isn't _Muslim-owned_ if you can help me think of one that encapsulates all the nuances of the issue at hand.",t3_ldtxhw,06-02-2021

This part read weird to me. Surely, you meant “giving no fucks”?

On the other hand, having no chill, would be over-reacting. 

I’d say perambulating over the equivalent of moving mechanical bone-crushing iron teeth while there’s a fire directly below epitomises having all the chill in the world - like [this dog](https://i.imgur.com/c4jt321.png).

472,18,g1psifb,t3_iao7gy,"Hey all! Just wanted to share this image of Jupiter I captured last night since many of you here seem interested in astrophotography. I captured this from a very light polluted location in Tampines surrounded by HDBs in all directions. 

Jupiter is a dynamic planet and its surface details never stay the same. The planet rotates extremely fast (8 hours to complete 1 rotation compared to 24 hours for Earth), allowing astrophotographers to theoretically be able to capture the whole surface of the planet in a single night (under the right conditions).

In this photograph you can see the famous Great Red Spot in the bottom right quadrant of the planet. The GRS is a storm larger than Earth that has been brewing for hundreds of years. Smaller, white colored storms known as “white ovals” can be seen in the bottom left quadrant. Brown colored “belts” and white “zones” can also be seen streaking across the planet’s surface.


How I captured this image

Things to note:
1. Most planets are very bright, and can be seen and photographed from any location regardless of the level of light pollution. These few months, take some time to look up at the sky at night. You may spot 2 bright, untwinkling white dots of light. The brighter dot is Jupiter, while the dimner dot is Saturn! If you wake up early in the morning (around 5 am), you can spot Mars hanging right above you in the sky as a red dot. Looking towards the east you can see Venus as a very very bright white star. 

2. The planets are very very small in the sky. For reference, try holding up your thumb at arm’s length. The size of your thumb at this distance is larger than the size of the full moon in the sky. Meanwhile, Jupiter, one of the largest planets in the sky, is only about the size of a crater on the Moon.

3. Singapore is a very good location to photograph the planets! Due to us being located near the equator, the planets rise up high in the sky allowing for clear views of the planets.

Equipment used:
A telescope. More specifically, an 8 inch Schmidt Cassegrain telescope.

- “8 inch” refers to the diameter of the telescope’s aperture (the hole at the front of the telescope which allows the telescope to collect light).

- “Schmidt Cassegrain” refers to the optical design of the telescope. A Schmidt Cassegrain scope uses glass lens and mirrors to collect and focus light. Telescopes of this type are very compact and portable.

A GoTo motorised equatorial mount.

- The telescope is mounted on the mount.

- A motorised equatorial mount is capable of automatically tracking the movement and rotation of celestial objects as they move across the sky.

- “GoTo” means that the mount is able to automatically point the telescope at celestial objects. The mount has an in-built database that can pinpoint exactly where different celestial objects will be in the sky from different locations at different times.

A dedicated planetary astrophotography camera.

- These cameras have a very narrow field of view, and is capable of taking photos and videos at very high FPS (frames per second).

- The camera is connected to the back of the telescope. The telescope acts as a giant telephoto lens to collect focus light onto the camera sensor.

Capturing the image
- For photographing the planets, we use a technique called “Lucky imaging”. This technique involves taking videos of the planet and splitting the video into its constituent frames, then combining the best frames into the final image.

- You know how when you look into a swimming pool you can never see the bottom of the pool clearly? This is caused by water in the pool constantly bending light in different directions, hence a constantly warped image of the bottom of the pool is seen. The same thing happens to light coming from the planets. Light from planets is also continuously refracted when passing through Earth’s turbulent atmosphere, albeit to a lesser extent. This causes the planets to “wobble” when seen through a telescope. This is why Singapore is a good location to photograph the planets. Since the planets rise up high in the sky as seen from Singapore, light from the planets pass through less atmosphere and the view of the planets are degraded to a lesser extent.

- However, there are lucky moments when the atmsophere is very still, and a near perfect view of the planet can be seen.

- This is why we take videos of the planets. A video is made of many photos (frames), and the number of frames recorded per second depends on the FPS of the camera used. For example, every second of a video recorded at 30 FPS consists of 30 frames. For planetary astrophotography, the higher the FPS of the camera, the better it is as the camera can capture more moments when the atmosphere is still.

- After 2-3 minutes of recording the video, we should have at least 2000 frames of the planet to be used for processing.

- For this image, I captured 1800 frames across 2 minutes.

Processing the image
- The video is plugged into software which splits it into all its constituent frames. I used a program called Lynkeos to do this.

- The software analyses the quality of each frame, and chooses the sharpest frames to be combined later on. For this image, I chose the best 1200 (out of 1800) frames to be used.

- The best frames are combined in a process called stacking, in which the planet in each frame is aligned and overlayed over each other to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the final image.

- Noise refers to random, false signals recorded by the camera sensor, while signal refers to actual light coming from the object. There are many sources of noise, including pixel malfunctions in the camera sensor, or even heat from electronics within the camera. Since noise is random, the amount and location of noise varies across different frames. However, signal from the planet is constant, and stacking (overlaying the frames over each other) averages out the noise, allowing a clear image of the planet to be produced.

- Different processes are applied to the stacked image to produce a clear image of the planet.

The reason credit card receipts take longer to print than store receipts is because when you make a card transaction, the machine has to make a connection to the card company to get a verification, and this process can take 15 seconds or longer.

**Update:** He's back home! Sorry for the late update. I don't live with my cousins and I only just heard. Am not too sure of the exact details but cousin's  kitchen's window mesh came loose and Kitteh fell out. They found him hiding under the rubbish-chute collector thingie early this morning. He's limping a little and will be going to the vet today. Cousins will be re-fortifying their house to prevent Kitteh from escaping again.

> A 62-year-old retiree living in Tampines is spending almost all his free time catching litterbugs in his Tampines estate by securing the photographic evidence and then reporting them to the National Environment Agency.

> The man, named Tan, performs his civic duty from the comforts of his HDB flat along Tampines Street 83, which overlooks an open-air car park, Shin Min Daily News reported.

> He single-handedly catches about 80 litterbugs red-handed every month -- with proof.

> His haul of catching inconsiderate people in action has even earned him the moniker, ""King of Reporting"".

> Aiming his camera at the car park, Tan started out initially in 2017 trying to capture on camera the inconsiderate resident who had been feeding pigeons in the estate on a daily basis and leaving a mess behind.

> He tried to record the culprit in action as evidence, but inevitably noticed that many others were littering in the car park.

> Since then, he has caught acts such as spitting and tossing of cigarettes.

> As long as he catches it, he reports it to the authorities.

> One-man mission almost 24 hours a day

> According to Shin Min, Tan sits by the window armed with a digital camera almost 24 hours a day, finger on the shutter button.

> He is ready to pounce at any moment.

> He naturally also takes down the car plates of perpetrators.

> Confronted before

> Tan's good work is not appreciated by all though, namely, those people he caught.

> The culprits have even turned up at his doorstep to confront him, but he does not respond.

> The retiree has also been exposed on social media, by people who managed to ferret out the tattletale.

> Tan maintains that he comes from a good place, wanting to minimise the number of litterbugs in the area.

> He also said he can’t help but feel disappointed whenever he catches a repeat offender.

> We deliver more stories to you on LinkedIn

“Don’t worry. Cats just have a different sixth sense, and can sense the presence of recently deceased persons. Sometimes the ethereal beings can be a little disoriented and have trouble finding their way to the after life. Cats, and even other animals, are their helpers and assist by accompanying them and waiting patiently to give them a sense of continuity as they wander around.

You can see this happen when cats randomly meow and move in circles in apparently empty spaces, It’s just them trying to get the spirits to get going. As long as the soul is moving, they will make the full transition to the spirit world. It’s only when they stop moving that the spirits are stuck in one place. At this juncture, if they feel distressed or scared, they lack the inner peace to leave this world behind and risk becoming ghostly beings, neither in this world Nor the next.

This is natural and you have to be grateful for the cat being a soothing creature and helping the spirit move onto its next journey in life.”",t3_d826yz,23-09-2019

> When Stomper Jen moved back into her mother's house in Oct this year, she was shocked to be greeted by so many buzzing mosquitoes.

> Jen told Stomp on Dec 7 that this issue has been happening at her mother's flat at Block 509 Tampines Central 1 since Oct, and has been going on until now.

> The photo shows the mosquitoes that Jen has killed and kept in Ziploc bags over a span of less than one month.

> ""I keep track of the mosquitoes that we catch every week. On the week of Nov 20, we caught a record number of 103 mosquitoes,"" Jen said.

> ""I am desperate to get rid of these mosquitoes. This living condition is affecting my family's quality of life and it's not conducive for us to work from home.

> ""We do get bitten by the mosquitos but not all the time, because we do hourly wipeouts with our three electric swatters to kill them.

> ""But even if they don't bite us, it is still very itchy when they're just flying around our legs.""

> Jen added that she has informed the National Environmental Agency (NEA) and Tampines Town Council about this matter.

> ""I hope that the overgrown tree outside my mother's house will be chopped down, because that is where mosquitoes are breeding and flying about,"" Jen said.

> ""I took a video of the mosquitoes flying around the tree, although I think the quality is not too good so it's hard to see them.""

> Stomp has contacted NEA and Tampines Town Council for more information.

A few drops of water for a few hours isn’t enough. 
She should be looking for litter and pools of water that don’t dry up after a day or so around her neighbourhood. The most likely answer is they are coming from stagnant water in her block somewhere.",t3_kg05j7,19-12-2020
975,18,ggbu76n,t1_ggbqlv5,Exactly this. I had the same issue with mosquitoes flying into my home so I installed screen doors which immediately solved the problem.,t3_kg05j7,19-12-2020
976,18,ggbv22k,t1_ggbqlv5,"I always wondered this too.  I would have assumed that screens would be more common in tropical countries like Singapore, Vietnam, etc.  Not because you have more bugs (plenty of bugs in Canada and the US), but because of the risk of disease transmission which isn’t as big in say, North America.",t3_kg05j7,19-12-2020

If they are clustering at OP house then, they are not effectively being disperse to control the population of the estate and ends up being killed, making the project pointless?

I was once in line at a kaffe and toast and this old aunty comes up to me and asks me for some money to buy food.....I say the same thing...I'm gonna order so I'll order for you. She seems pissed and I again asked her what she wanted and she's like she wants the noodles or something. I order the food and then she starts cursing at me (the tone made it sound like cursing) and spat to the side, like how old people curse at someone. Then she goes and sits down with what looks like her family....kids, grandkids who are all eating food that they presumably bought. Dunno what the fuck was going on and why she asked me to buy for her when her entire family was there.",t3_fih88n,14-03-2020

There was a middle age guy at bishan bus interchange he was asking us for small change. Fortunately, a middle age lady who was standing in a corner gesturing to us not to give.

I asked him where he wanted to go and bought him a ticket for it, which he seemed happy about. Don't think he was scamming me per se but he definitely had planned the whole thing to get a free ride whether out of desperation or what I don't know.

I was heading up to go pay at a mamak and this auntie came over and asked if she could put her stuff on my table and have me looked after her groceries while she head to the loo. I was leaving anyway so I told her she can just have the table, she then proceeded to ask me if I have $2 so she can buy a drink since she supposedly used up all her cash from buying stuff. I told her no.
When she came out and just nice, the cashier handed me a $2 note which she saw and she just kept following me back to the table, pestering me to get her a drink. 
“Auntie very thirsty, buy me 1 teh okay??”

I got really weirded out by this and just want to have it over with, so ordered one and paid for it. Asked the cashier if this auntie comes by here often but nope, it’s her first time there at this mamak.",t3_fih88n,14-03-2020

While there are many scams going around in singapore, I feel we must be open to helping others in need, especially the less privileged, and as long as its within our means. For the auntie to behave so desperately for a packet of rice everyday, she must have some untold story; that rice could be her breakfast, or dinner for her family member.

EDIT: The algae is not isolated to a single patch as shown in the photo, there are algae growths all around the block and adjacent blocks as well. The point I'm trying to get at is that TC should start looking into their contractors and how well they do the cement works from now on.

EDIT2: Well, it worked I guess! Looks like filing complaints and feedback is the way to get things done. Took only 24 hours since this post went up but they've now cleaned up the area.

Next, Tracetogether gives info on whether you meet that person and the duration. Just because you both checked in at the same place doesn't mean you run into one another. Trace together is a better tool for contact tracing.

And the forest is a whole new ball park man. We're talking about grass along your HDB, where any damage to the vegetation will be CLEARLY VISIBLE.
In the forest the land area is much larger, with trees that roots go deep underground. The floor in the jungle is also mostly just dead leaves, animals. Compost, to say the least. Urine isnt gonna kill anything that's already dead.

So no, the forest won't die because of the urine. But the grass under your HDB flat surely will.

People are telling you it doesn’t, at least not at the degree/frequency of peeing that is realistically being discussed here.

The disagreement you have in your mind (which is that it’s not a good idea for pets to pee on grass) is predicated on the following thought process: 

their pee kills the grass → this grass death is very visible → this visible death is an eye sore → which goes against the country’s efforts to maintain a pretty landscape → which then costs money to rectify

Your argument is supported by your thought process, which has merit within the chain, but once the very first item gets disproven, the whole chain crumbles and your argument has no standing.

> He said he was driving along Tampines Road at around 3pm when he noticed a stationary car that had stopped on the grass patch.

> Sensing something was amiss as the car did not have its hazard lights on, he decided to stop as he also noticed that the driver seemed to be ""sliding to his left"".

> He approached the car to find the driver sitting inside the locked car, and kept banging on the window in an attempt to get a response.

> The driver remained unresponsive, and was suspected to be suffering from a cardiac arrest.

> Erman then called the police for assistance.

> According to his post, he said that a few other drivers had also stopped.

> They managed to break a rear window of the car using a hammer and a metal pole, and unlocked the doors from the inside to pull the driver out.

> As the driver's foot was on the brakes, Erman pulled the handbrake and shifted the gear to neutral, so that the car would not move forward when the driver was moved.

> One of the other motorists, known as Taufiq, also performed CPR on the man until an ambulance arrived.

> Thinking that the driver's phone was ringing, Erman went to retrieve it from the car.

> That was when he noticed the driver's handphone wallpaper – apparently a photo of young children, which he presumed to be the driver's offspring.

> This made him think about his own kids, he said, as he contemplated his own mortality.

> ""What if it was me? How will my wife cope?... This message is a reminder to myself,"" he wrote.

> SINGAPORE — Just across the road from Tampines Mall is an HDB block in a seemingly peaceful neighbourhood.

> For nearly a decade, however, a female resident of an eighth-floor unit at Block 247 Tampines Street 21 has been shouting insults and vulgarities out of her window multiple times a day. According to the woman’s neighbours, each episode lasts an average of about 15 minutes.

> The offending resident also allegedly throws rubbish out of her windows on a regular basis and has also splashed water onto neighbours’ laundry on multiple occasions. Even a court order imposed on the resident in 2017 to seek psychiatric treatment did not deter her from disturbing her neighbours’ peace.

> When Yahoo News Singapore visited the block on 12 and 13 June, her shrill voice could be heard even from the ground floor.

> Most of the woman’s immediate neighbours said they had gotten used to her behaviour, with some saying that they no longer hang their laundry outside their windows.

> One neighbour, however, has borne the brunt of Lee Dji Lin’s verbal assaults, which come in three languages: English, Malay and Mandarin.

> Marliah Jonet, a 64-year-old widow who lives directly above Lee, said the latter’s insults often mention her husband and daughter, who both died some years ago.

> Such hurtful comments are the reason why she lodged numerous formal complaints with the authorities regarding Lee’s behaviour.

> “I feel bad when I call the police. I don’t want to be a bad neighbour,” said Marliah, who shares the flat with her 26-year-old daughter.

> She added that some of Lee’s insults hurt her “to the core”. These included accusations of Marliah being responsible for her husband’s death and of her late daughter and of Marliah having loose morals. Lee has also allegedly hurled racial and religious taunts at Marliah.

> Things came to a head in 2017 when Lee threw pork onto the corridor outside Marliah’s flat. After pleading guilty to charges of wounding her neighbour’s religious feelings and harassment, Lee underwent a psychiatric assessment and was later handed a two-year Mandatory Treatment Order (MTO) by the court.

> Those subjected to an MTO are required to seek psychiatric treatment and must comply with the conditions imposed by the court or their appointed psychiatrist.

> Following the court case, Marliah and her neighbours said they did not hear any of the usual noises coming from Lee’s unit for about three to four months. Then, the screaming began again.

> The past nine years have been emotionally draining for Marliah, who has kept meticulous records of Lee’s insults and her own efforts in seeking help from the authorities.

> Over the years, she has contacted HDB, Tampines Town Council, grassroots leaders and her former Member of Parliament in the hopes of resolving the issue. Marliah even sought voluntary mediation several times at the former Subordinate Courts, but Lee refused to make an appearance when called for.

> In desperation, Marliah even e-mailed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in 2011, whose representatives referred her to the Tampines Town Council. All in all, while she did meet helpful people along the way, none of these parties were able to put an end to Lee’s incessant taunting.

> Marliah had regularly contacted the police, too, on the matter. However, in late March she was told in writing that the police – after consulting with the Attorney-General’s Chambers and considering the facts of the case – would not be taking any further action.

> Lee did not answer her door when a Yahoo News Singapore reporter knocked on it. According to several neighbours, whenever police officers knocked on her door, she would either not respond or slam the door on them.

> Over the two visits to Marliah’s house, Lee was heard yelling insults multiple times.

> Neighbours, who declined to give their full names, said they were aware of what Lee was saying.

> One neighbour, Yeo, 71, said he did not like the noise pollution Lee caused but has learnt to ignore it. Another neighbour, Ho, 58, said the shouting can be so annoying at times that another resident would shout back at Lee to be quiet.

> Several other neighbours corroborated the accounts of Lee’s behaviour over the years, and were aware that she had been slapped with an MTO.

> Teo, 70, said Lee would soil any clothes that she hung our her window to dry. A longtime resident of the block, Teo said she had tried speaking to Lee’s husband about 12 years ago but the man defended his wife.

> Just like Marliah, Teo said that she, too, is sometimes subjected to personal insults from Lee, who insinuates that she is a “loose” woman.

> Teo also claimed that on the occasions she bumped into Lee in the neighbourhood, the latter would mutter insults at her.

> “If I were to take her words to heart, I will be troubled by it,” said Teo.

> When contacted by Yahoo News Singapore, criminal lawyers said that each of Lee’s insults directed at Marliah could merit a police report.

> Aside from mediation, which is voluntary, those caught in neighbourly disputes can also file a case with the Community Dispute Resolution Tribunal at the State Courts.

> The court can award damages and make orders that have to be complied with, failing which an offender can be prosecuted. Aggrieved neighbours can also file for protection from harassment in person without the need for a lawyer at the Community Justice Centre at the State Courts.

> While Marliah said she is aware of some of the legal options available to her, she also lacks the financial means to afford a lawyer. There is no legal aid available for cases involving sparring neighbours.

> For now, she only hopes the taunts and insults will stop at some point.

> “I will accept any help I can get,” she said. “I have good relations with my other neighbours. I still believe in the police and government system.”

No, that's your interpretation of the intent of the post. Read it again. At no point did the op imply or even suggests a witch hunt for whatever reason. 


>Who's the one raising religious tension actually?


Nobody in this thread. Surely you have to agree, which you already have, that the act of throwing pork into a Muslim household is a racially charged act, no matter how you look at it. Even the article mentions that the pork bit was the culmination of a series of events that included the alleged use of 'racial and religious taunts at Marliah'.",t3_c38vf4,22-06-2019

What other implication is left then that more action must be taken against a mentally ill person. Call it social justice or a witch hunt? Pick your choice of semantics.

As whether it is racially charged, I never claimed the act itself wasn't. But things must be seen in context. Many people seem to forget she is mentally ill. 

If Muslims found out a sane, apparently well adjusted person did this, they will be upset for sure. But if they realize it was a mentally ill person, I'm sure they will much more forgiving or even brush it off. This does not mean she should not be penalized but against which context are people judging her against now.

And making or implying false claims that someone escaped punishment for a racially charged act certainly sounds like it will contribute to religious tension in society.",t3_c38vf4,22-06-2019

Here it is.


>Did or did not the op state that she escaped punishment when she has actually already been sentenced/penalized for the act? Yes or no? 


Yes. I'll give you this one. 


>What other implication is left then that more action must be taken against a mentally ill person. Call it social justice or a witch hunt? Pick your choice of semantics. 


Op in no way implied whatever it is you interpreted. Again, read op's statement. Find the exact line that, without a shadow of a doubt, implies it. But you're right, this is all semantics. Irrelevant compared to the next point. 


>As whether it is racially charged, I never claimed the act itself wasn't. But things must be seen in context. Many people seem to forget she is mentally ill. 


The person is allegedly capable of racial and religious slurs, as well as throwing pork into a Muslim household. If the person threw a raw fish, chicken or even an egg, I can somewhat get your point, but the evidence proves otherwise. There is no doubt the act was racially charged, despite her mental state, unless you can prove otherwise. 


You being mentally ill does not give you a pass to be a racist, or to break the law. What kind of precedent are you trying to set here, may I ask? 


>If Muslims found out a sane, apparently well adjusted person did this, they will be upset for sure. But if they realize it was a mentally ill person, I'm sure they will much more forgiving or even brush it off. This does not mean she should not be penalized but against which context are people judging her against now.


And that's your take on the situation, a very admirable and noble one I must say. Yet I don't see the point of changing the context in this situation. The court has charged her with intent to wound religious feelings - nothing you say can change that. Mentally ill or not, she still has to take responsibility for her actions. 


>And making or implying false claims that someone escaped punishment for a racially charged act certainly sounds like it will contribute to religious tension in society.

Personally, having stayed in Woodlands for over 20 years, it has been pretty terrible for me. I wasted so much of my life commuting. 

Plus food scene here is so sad. Made worse when they tore down the old Woodlands market. And if you stay on the other side where there are no hawker, with mostly food courts in neighbourhood malls, food is also generally more expensive than hawker in mature estates. 

But if you have a car, Woodlands is about equal distance to most places in SG. Almost everywhere is 30-40 mins. That's good. But at the same time, it's equally far to most workplaces, unless you work in the north. 

People love saying ""Woodlands good, go JB near"". Having been chased by gangsters there when I was younger (during sec sch) multiple times and know some of my friends who frequent there got extorted and some got car stolen or broken in, I have no love for that place. I don't even think my woodlands friends goes to JB often tbh. I have so many horror stories of Johor, it's not even funny. 

On the whole, I personally fricking dislike this sh\*thole as a long time resident, but I also rate it higher than some estates in Jurong and Punggol. Would have moved out if not for saving $ to down as much as possible for a place in town when I get married.

Sports: the area was originally a sports complex, so it makes sense the mall has them since it was supposed to be a renovation of these facilities but evolved into a full fledged mall with these features integrated into the layout. So there’s an indoor running track, badminton/TT halls, swimming pools, football field etc. There’s laser tag. And obviously all the sport stores are there too. 

Community: a lot of screenings/live performances. I don’t think there’s ever been a time (pre-covid) I’ve gone there in the evening and there isn’t some movie being screened or a performance. During world cup they also did match screenings there with some really nice looking cushion chairs (altho up to you to lie on something a lot of ppl have probably been on lol). Also has a pretty nice and big Public Service Centre (PSC) for settling gov stuff. 

Families: sports facilities aside, also got like those childcare etc in the basement iirc. Fairprice for grocery shopping. The hawker centre is one of those social enterprise ones so meals are very cheap, and there’s a lot of options. There is a theatre there that [screens a few current movies for a low price](https://i.imgur.com/GuiKUOv.jpg) ($6 if you watch on a weekday with OTH passion card, $9 for weekend), altho there’s no online booking [obv this isn’t open now, thanks covid]. 

Not to mention the location, it’s very near Tampines MRT. The walk to the mall is sheltered.

The police are not your teacher or parent or friend or guardian or whatever else. They are the police and they have as much responsibility towards you the victim, AND also the perpetrator. The polices’ job is not to convict said perpetrator on the spot - that is the job of the prosecutor and court. Likewise, the polices’ job is not to console the victim, as this would imply a crime has definitely, incontrovertibly, 100% no doubt, been committed. As much as you know that you saw the perpetrator hiding in the toilet, the police were doing their due diligence by collecting all appropriate evidence - and that includes asking if the perpetrator admitted to committing the crime; ironically it might help secure a conviction... Further, counselling does not exactly fall under the job scope of police.

TLDR: police are not Batman. They do not and should not be moral vigilantes, swooping in to save the damsel in distress.  I should stress that this doesn’t mean the police should do nothing; but as far as I can tell, the police did their due and (rightly) assessed that an arrest was warranted - so action was taken, but what the victim is complaining and proposing is for the police to do more than they should.",t3_a9oquc,26-12-2018

> On Aug. 15, an Instagram user in Singapore started posting images of allegedly stolen panties and shorts.

> These photos were apparently taken at Tampines Street 33.

> From Tampines to Choa Chu Kang

> And it seems that he has also travelled to Choa Chu Kang for this pair of shorts.

> According to his caption, he allegedly released “3 days worth of load” on the shorts aptly (and unfortunately) branded Something Borrowed:

> The likelihood of this Instagram account being real and not a troll thing is unknown.

> If it is real, what the man is doing is highly illegal as it clearly compromises public health.

> If it is fake, it is disturbing enough for someone to call the police.

1680,18,gdr7im0,t3_k1vqzr,"From the article, regarding the customer:

>On Thursday night, the Health Ministry (MOH) said that a  32-year-old Singaporean, who works as a service engineer, had dinner with 12 family members at Seoul Garden last Saturday before he developed a fever and sore throat on Monday. That was when he was tested for Covid-19. 

> He was at Seoul Garden **between 5.45pm and 8.55pm on Nov 21**.

> The Master Systems Marine employee's job entails going on board vessels docked at Marina South Pier and West Coast Pier for servicing and maintenance of ships' navigational systems.

> He became Singapore's first locally transmitted Covid-19 case in 16 days.

and from the [linked article](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/first-covid-19-community-case-in-16-days-had-visited-seoul-garden-at-tampines-mall):

>The man, who developed a fever and sore throat on **Monday (Nov 23)**,......After developing symptoms, he went to a general practitioner clinic **the next day,** where he was tested for Covid-19.

>He typically worked alone, and had no interaction with vessel crew except for a supervising crew member. On days when he was not working onboard vessels, he had remained at his office located at Vertex Building Tower B, located at 33 Ubi Avenue 3.

And the restaurant:

>When The Straits Times visited the restaurant at about 10.50am on **Friday (Nov 27)**, a Seoul Garden employee was putting up a notice that read: ""We are closed. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.""

>The worker told ST it will be closed until further notice, as the restaurant was preparing for disinfection. **It was last open on Thursday**.

Was trying to figure out a timeline. So it seems like it takes a couple days for the diagnosis to reach the F&B establishment.

> The Ministry of Health (MOH) has ordered the Seoul Garden restaurant located in Tampines Mall to suspend its full operations from Dec. 5 to Dec. 14 (both dates inclusive) after it failed to ensure safe-distancing management measures on its premise.

> It cannot offer dining-in or takeaway services.

> The restaurant was visited by a 32-year-old man with 12 other family members on Nov. 21, 2020. Although the family members were seated at separate tables of up to five persons per table, investigations revealed that there had been mingling among them.

> The restaurant did not take reasonable steps to prevent the intermingling, said MOH.

> The man later tested positive for Covid-19. He is Case 58401.

> Investigations against the man and his family are currently ongoing, and further enforcement action may be taken.

> MOH said:

> ""MOH will not hesitate to take enforcement action against operators and individuals who fail to comply with the safe distancing and safe management measures. Any person convicted of an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 is liable to a fine of up to S$10,000, or up to six months’ imprisonment, or to both. In the case of second or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding S$20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.""

> The ministry also urged the public to continue to exercise social responsibility and comply with safe management measures.

A German professor did say this virus needs people to meet to spread. Hence the rules were introduced and subsequent tweak over phase 1 to phase 2 and the awaited phase 3 to gradually let the country know we're turning the tide

I just don't want the frontliners, such as Temperature takers, healthcare workers, delivery personnel efforts to keep the country safe & functioning as best as the circumstances will allow to go to waste.

Again, enforcement is like the hand-holding i'm sure we don't like or want. All said and done, the onus is on oneself to help continue turn the tide.

The law is not the problem. The problem is people's reaction to the incident that happened within the current legal boundaries. Supposed the current permissable limit is fifteen person and the guy got covid. You think people will be rushing to condemn the family? Will the condemnation be as severe if it's a gathering of 5 people intermingling and the guy got the virus? The law say it's ok so it's fair game? Once again, it's not the law that is the problem.

> Ms Loke went to the women's toilet on the first floor at Tampines Point at 9.48pm on Oct 12 last year.

> She entered the third cubicle and placed her phone on the tissue dispenser box.

> However, she left the washroom without the device and realised that she had forgotten to take it only while walking towards a restaurant.

> The accused, 36-year-old Fauziah Abdul Rahim, was working as a serving crew member at the nearby Captain Kim Restaurant.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> She entered the washroom at around the same time as the victim, and saw the phone left unattended on top of the tissue dispenser after the victim left.

> She took the phone and kept it inside the front pocket of her apron and went to work at the restaurant.

> When Ms Loke rushed back to the toilet, she could not find her phone, and went to the building's security officer for help.

> They viewed closed-circuit television footage and found that Fauziah was the only woman who had used the same washroom at around the time of the incident.

> They also saw that she wore the staff uniform of Captain Kim Restaurant.

> Ms Loke went to the restaurant manager, who confronted Fauziah about the phone. However, she denied taking it, said State Prosecuting Officer M Mariyappan.

> A friend of the victim's called the police about the incident that very night.

> Fauziah went home with the phone and was asked about it again the next day when she went to work.

> Even though she kept quiet then, she later decided to admit to her actions and surrendered herself to the police on Oct 22, 10 days after the incident.

> She returned the handphone, but not the SIM card, which she had disposed of earlier.

> Fauziah pleaded guilty to one charge of dishonestly misappropriating the phone, and admitted that she had no intention of returning it to its owner.

> For dishonest misappropriation, she could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, or both.

> The resident said that she saw the delivery man masturbating outside her house after the delivery.

> Speaking to Mothership, she said that she saw the man doing the deed through the door's peephole when she was about to throw away the empty box.

> It was a ""really traumatising event"" to her as it is the first time she has encountered such an incident.

> She added that she was disgusted and appalled to see the man touching her shoe rack before leaving.

> Security guards managed to stop the man

> The resident took a video through the peephole as evidence and alerted the security guards who managed to stop the man at the front gate of the condominium.

> The police were also alerted and went up to her house to take her statement.

> The police confirmed with Mothership that they received a call for assistance at the said location at 11:44am.

I had been a ""Woodlander"" since birth, but after I left Singapore for studies and work opportunities my old flat is reconstituted as ""Marsiling,"" and a separate entity from the rest of the ""hip and cool"" Woodlands.

When I was growing up, ""Marsiling"" was a neighbourhood that overlooked the Woodlands Checkpoint and the connecting Admiralty Road West (before Woodlands Waterfront made it popular again, this was a sleepy part of Singapore that was ignored by the hustle and bustle of the ever-changing development that happened elsewhere). The former Si Ling Secondary served as a schooling ground for people of that area. People who lived in this general area (see Google Maps for the roads named ""Marsiling"") don't generally have a reputable status owing to the old and ageing population that lived there, as well as how [Si Ling was notorious previously for being a haven for gangsterism](https://fionaseah.com/tag/si-ling-secondary-school/) so it comes to mind that the denizens there are also generally less well-off and secretly troubled (they are not *as troubled* as Yishun, though).

> ""A woman at the salon told him halfway through the facial treatment that it would cost $20 per oil pimple removed.

> ""As an old person, my grandpa's understanding was that the total amount would be less than $100. However, after the whole treatment, he was billed $4,445!

> ""The woman did not even give him an invoice or receipt.

> ""My grandpa, not wanting to want to create problems, paid $2,000 to them via NETS.""

> However, as Ho's grandpa had reached his NETS limit of $2,000, he had to go to the bank to withdraw cash for the remaining balance.

> Ho told Stomp: ""The woman from the salon followed my grandpa to the bank, where the bank teller alerted him to the possible scam, especially after noticing that the $2,000 transaction that he had made earlier.

> ""Just to clarify, this is not a package! It's a one-time facial price so we were surprised.""

> Ho said he tried asking the salon for a receipt several times but to no avail, prompting him to drop by the place on Sunday (Sep 20), reported Shin Min Daily News.

> A dispute occurred between both parties.

> Two videos that Ho shared with Stomp show the elderly man's family confronting staff at the beauty salon.

> In one video, a female employee is heard saying that she had explained to the elderly man about how each oil bump costs $20 to be removed and that she had counted each one aloud.

> Employee: ""So I don't understand why you all have to come and find me leh.""

> Man: ""We have never had a facial that costs $4,445 in all these years, so we came to understand [the situation]. And can you give us the receipt?""

> Employee: ""You all cannot film me like this leh.""

> Man: ""Why not?""

> Employee: ""You all -""

> Man: ""We want to understand.""

> Employee: ""You all cannot keep filming me like this leh.""

> Man: ""We just want to understand, whole Singapore never had a facial that costs $4,445 before.""

> Employee: ""Stop filming, keep your phones.""

> In a second video, another female employee can be heard telling the elderly man's family to stop filming her without permission.

> The family can also be heard challenging the employee to call the police, with one man saying: ""I know Singapore's law.""

> The employee said: ""First of all, I need to tell you one thing clearly. When my colleague [here], your father came to us on his own, we did not pull him in.

> ""Whatever my colleague did for him, she would definitely have told him the price. If she did not inform the price, we would not anyhow do it.""

> Both parties started arguing, with the family requesting for a receipt and the employee asking them to leave the elderly man's name, phone number and signature.

> The police were eventually called in.

> In response to a Stomp query, the police confirm a report was lodged and investigations are ongoing.

> When contacted by Shin Min, the owner of the salon said that the elderly man had understood and agreed to the price before the treatment began.

> Ms Huang, 40, said that the elderly man had requested for his feet to be washed as well as enquired about removing the bumps on his face and neck during his visit.

> The salon did not solicit customers, said Ms Huang.

> She added: ""The CCTV footage clearly shows staff specifically telling him that it would cost $20 for every oil bump.

> ""He began the treatment after understanding this and was also aware that he could stop the treatment anytime.

> ""During the treatment, the staff also counted aloud every oil bump one by one for him.""

> According to salon staff, the elderly man had 220 oil bumps removed, which amounted to $4,400. Coupled with his $158 facial, his total bill was $4,558.

> As he had only paid $2,000, no receipt was issued.

> Ms Huang also denied that her staff had accompanied the elderly man to the bank and said that he had gone on his own. He then returned to confront her staff afterwards, before leaving angrily and refusing to pay the balance.

> According to Shin Min Daily News, the employee who served the elderly man claimed that he had requested for 'special services'.

> The elderly man denied doing so and said it was his first time hearing of this.

> Ho told Shin Min: ""My grandpa is already 87 years old, it is hard to believe that he would make such a request.""

The most important one being the elderly man is 87 years old, which Singapore law would classify him as ""vulnerable adult"". Heck, even if this was written in black and white and the elderly signed a formal contract to accept the offer, the contract would probably be voided in court. What more if it is a verbal acceptance of offer where the judge will consider ""objective interpretation"" where any reasonable person would not have interpreted the offer as $20 per pore which is basically extortion.

And yes, there are tons of precedent cases, insurance agents preying on elderly to sign unfavourable policies, it doesn't matter if the elderly accepted the offer and have signed the contract. The contract will be voided as the elderly is deemed to be vulnerable and unable to understand nature of the contract and protect his self-interest. Few years back, shops in Sim Lim also got into legal problems when it was proven that they overcharged tourist many folds above market price. Heck, even shops that were over charging mask got into trouble.",t3_iwzcnf,23-09-2020
2205,18,g6avjdd,t1_g6arncs,"Hi, I think you’re wrong.

Firstly, to be a vulnerable adult does not just mean the person is old - the person must also (from website):

a. is 18 years of age or older;
b. has a mental or physical infirmity, disability or incapacity; and because of it
c. is unable to protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect or self-neglect.

Hence, the old man or his team must prove that he has a mental incapacity and because of that wasn’t able to protect himself from abuse / neglect / self-neglect. And judging from the definition from the Statute, these words “abuse / neglect / self neglect” don’t seem to apply in this case as far as we can tell from the article.

Secondly, what made the Sim Lim square case egregious was because the perpetrators had a “conspiracy to cheat”. If you actually read the case and see the flow of events, I don’t think there’s any conspiracy to cheat done here. Except that part on the no invoice does seem fishy to me.

Thirdly, the mask issue was because they brought in the Price Control Act which is only applied to very selective bunch of “price-regulated goods”. I don’t see how the Controller would come into this case to chase after a oil pore buster or whatever it is.

Fourthly, please be civil, logical, and rational. No need to cast doubts on my knowledge (or lack thereof) as you implied in “and if you really knew how contract law works”. We are all here to learn and discuss but we must be steadfast in addressing popular but erroneous statements that are stated as fact, or people who (accidentally?) present themselves as experts on the subject.",t3_iwzcnf,23-09-2020
2206,18,g6axw51,t1_g6avjdd,"Hi, apologies if I came across as being rude.

a) no you are definitely 100% wrong on this, vulnerable adult doesn't mean the person must have some form of disability. Even illiteracy or lack of education, causing lack of understanding of transaction is valid ground for termination of contract. This is reason why when it comes to formal contracts like insurance etc, they must be a witness or the contract would be voided. This was one of the most important point when I was studying contract law. 

b) Not issuing any invoice as proof of payment, in my opinion, is consideration of ""conspiracy to cheat"". But since I am a business student and not a law student, I will not commend on this.

c) Not going to argue on this either. 

Main point being, if this is brought to the court, the ""contract"" would not be enforceable. It is simply too easy for the elderly man to win. If the staff followed the old man to the bank, the elderly man can simply say he was acting under duress and it is game over.",t3_iwzcnf,23-09-2020
2207,18,g6azpjq,t1_g6axw51,"Hi, I don’t think our statements on part (a) are discordant / mutually exclusive, since “mental incapacity” is a very broad term.

For your other points, fair enough. I don’t think you should discount yourself just because you are a business student. Every person should have the right in understanding and discussing the law. After all, we are having a civil discussion where outside observers can quickly glean points and see what are commonly misunderstood parts.

> You might have seen news of a Tampines resident at Blk 509 Tampines Central 1 exterminating 323 mosquitoes found in her house, in just one month.

> The resident, Jen, documented the sheer quantity by storing and separating the carcasses in ziploc bags, each labelled with the total number killed in a week.

> On the week of Nov. 20, Jen said she caught a ""record number"" of 103 mosquitoes.

> She explained that the buzzing insects were affecting her ""family's quality of life"", and suspected that they were breeding in an ""overgrown tree"" outside her home.

> Aedes mosquito population decreased since release of Wolbachia mosquitoes

> In response to Mothership's queries, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has revealed that the large swarm of insects likely consist of male Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.

> These mosquitoes do not bite, and were released as part of the agency's efforts to curb the Aedes population in the area.

> Male Wolbachia Aedes mosquitoes are sterile, and when released, will mate with female Aedes mosquitoes, resulting in unfertilised eggs.

> According to NEA, the Wolbachia mosquitoes were first released in Tampines East Constituency in Feb. 2020.

> Since then, there has been a general decrease in the population of Aedes mosquitoes in the constituency.

> The average of between three to four female Aedes mosquitoes caught in every 10 Gravitraps per week, has declined to about one female Aedes mosquito, as of Nov. 2020.

> For the precinct where Blk 509 is located, the Gravitrap surveillance system used to catch about four to five female Aedes mosquitoes in every 10 Gravitraps per week.

> Since the release of male Wolbachia mosquitoes in May 2020, the number caught has halved to two to three female dengue mosquitoes per 10 Gravitraps per week.

> However, there was still a small cluster of two dengue cases in the area recently.

> To prevent further dengue outbreaks, NEA will continue releasing male Wolbachia mosquitoes in the area. The goal is to reach 90 per cent suppression of the Aedes mosquito population.

> Will adjust distribution of Wolbachia mosquito release

> NEA explained that the male mosquitoes sometimes swarm in one area, which was what Jen experienced.

> The agency added that they have reached out to Jen.

> NEA officers have also inspected her home and advised her to spray insecticide to kill any adult mosquitoes.

> They added that they will work with Jen to obtain mosquito samples to further investigate the matter, and will continue to work closely with Tampines Town Council on the feedback about the tree in front of Jen's home.

> ""We understand the inconvenience experienced by some residents in Project Wolbachia areas,"" NEA said.

> To minimise such occurrences of swarming, the distribution of the mosquito release will be adjusted.

> NEA warned that residents may encounter more male Wolbachia mosquitoes on Monday and Friday mornings, which is when the mosquitoes are released.

> In response to feedback on mosquito biting in the area, officers conducted two rounds of checks on Nov. 24 and Dec. 8.

> Officers uncovered two mosquito breeding habitats in a gully trap and flower pot plate.

> NEA said:

> ""NEA would like to remind residents that community vigilance and action remain critical in our fight against dengue, as the Aedes aegyptimosquitoes thrive in the urban environment and the majority of mosquito breeding habitats are still found in homes.""

> They urged residents to continue with the Mozzie Wipeout and to remove all sources of stagnant water.

> Totally unrelated but follow and listen to our podcast here

>Residents in study sites do not have to do anything differently. You may use NEA-registered insecticides or any gadget to kill mosquitoes as you normally would. Residents must remain vigilant and continue to carry out mosquito control measures, and regularly practise the Mozzie Wipeout to keep the mosquito population low.  

NEA does not expect/ask residents to avoid killing the Wolbachia mosquitos. What the lady did is valid. If they swarmed her apartment, then it is a problem of release and distribution of the male mosquitos that NEA has to improve upon. It's not going to work well if 100 male mosquitos swarm her house and there's only 1 female in there to mate with anyway.",t3_khjejo,22-12-2020

> SINGAPORE - A Tampines resident noticed a strange smell in her flat on Tuesday morning (Jan 29).

> The 62-year-old eventually traced the smell to a dark red liquid which was dripping from the ceiling in her master bedroom.

> Suspecting that the liquid might be blood, the woman, who gave her name only as Ms Jamilah, asked her son-in-law to call the police.

> In response to queries, the police said that they were alerted to an incident at Block 440 Tampines Street 43 at 8.43am. It was classified as a case of unnatural death.

> A 77-year-old man was found lying motionless in a residential unit in the block and he was subsequently pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene.

> A neighbour told Chinese daily Lianhe Wanbao that he had not seen the man in recent days. However, he did not suspect anything unusual as the man did not socialise with anyone and was usually home only in the evenings.

> According to Wanbao, the man is believed to have died about a week ago.

> The police are investigating the case.

In the cold and soulless room, I realised that the dripping sound was coming from the living room instead. I tried to turn on the lights but nothing works anymore in that old house. Fumbling through the dark, I tried to locate the source of the sound.

&#x200B;

With my hands outstretched, I approached the sound with caution. Then I felt it as the droplets fell on me. It was a warm and viscous liquid. I raised my hands to reach the source and the droplets fell onto my open palms and trickled down my arms.  I wasn't able to reach the source but it was clear the droplets were coming from the ceiling.

&#x200B;

As more droplets fell on me, I started to smell the horrible stench it brought. The heavy stench of decay mixed with the metallic odor of iron. I wanted to puke. The reflex was immediate but I managed to hold it back. It dawned on me that this liquid was blood... ...

> When Stomper Rosalina noticed that an uncle was playing loud music at the void deck in mid-June, she was fine with it.

> However, as the months went on, she realised it was an everyday occurrence and her patience started wearing thin.

> Rosalina told Stomp on Oct 7 that the uncle would blast loud music at the void deck between Block 201D Tampines Street 21 and Block 201E Tampines Street 23, and that she could hear the music from inside her house.

> (Video taken on Sep 28 at 9am)

> ""This uncle would play his music at maximum volume at 8am, during lunch time, at midday, during dinner and even after dinner. The worst part is that the music would continuously blast for hours,"" Rosalina said.

> ""There is no consideration given to the residents living nearby. It is selfish behavior that has been causing my family distress as most of us are working from home.

> ""We can't function properly even with all our doors and windows closed because the music can still be heard.

> ""There are so many ways to enjoy music but definitely not at the expense of others.""

> ""This hell and nightmare started happening a week after Phase Two commenced. If you want to hear how annoyingly loud the music can get, you better not because it will turn you deaf before you know it.""

> (Photo taken on Aug 3 at 8.15am)

> Rosalina added that she has lodged a police report and informed Tampines Town Council about the situation.

> She also shared that something like this has never happened to her before.

> ""My family has lived in this area for 20 years and we are always able to live harmoniously with the uncles and aunties. The sounds of chitchatting, dogs barking, kids screaming and shops opening for businesses are totally okay,"" Rosalina said.

> ""But it is a different story with loud music like this as it feels like we are living beside a roadshow that is taking place daily.""

> In response to a Stomp query, the police confirmed that a report was lodged.

> Stomp has contacted Tampines Town Council for more information.

In any case if the offender does not wish to comply and you wish not to act on further (the cost of extra effort, or the risk of physical altercation is high), I think that's fine, I myself wouldnt want to go further, but at least you are sending a strong message to these people their behaviour is not acceptable. If I may be optimistic, hopefully they may reconsider their actions one day. Who knows if they keep up their inconsiderate actions THEY will get into trouble with authorities.

If we just keep quiet in fear forever, we are the ones simmering in misery, they are the ones getting away with shit.

I know we Singaporeans are raised in a culture of confrontation-avoidance. That's understandable. I may be more aggressive than many of my SG friends, but I'm probably considered meek compared to typical Hong Kongers or Australians. That's fine too. But I always try to have a thicker skin, try to do what I believe is right. Others can choose to disagree with me; the noisy uncle can choose to disagree that he is inconveniencing others. But I try to always do something about it, success or otherwise. **Complaining on the internet, or reporting to Stomp, is simply not as effective as doing it yourself.**",t3_jvr7vr,18-11-2020
2400,18,gcoohnp,t1_gcol7bo,">If we just keep quiet in fear forever, we are the ones simmering in misery, they are the ones getting away with shit.

I totally agree with you. I think that if more Singaporeans felt the same and speak up with us, then these inconsiderate people would be more intimidated or aware and stop thinking that they're invincible. Sadly, whenever I speak up no one listens, (maybe because I'm a young female? Which is also why I can't ""go further"" in escalating the situation) and no one else around me appears bothered by the noise so I look like the unreasonable one for trying to make such requests. 

In our local culture I feel that people will feel entitled to being loud in public unless there's an official regulation prohibiting it, OR they are publicly shamed by a significant number of people. Usually, if only one person speaks up they won't be affected. So I think that's the sad but unfortunate truth to why people resort to social media. 

Personally, I hope that more people start to speak up IRL. But it's not a perfect world, and in the meantime, I think people posting about this issue on social media is a baby step in the right direction as it spreads awareness of good social behaviour and starts discussion on noise pollution.",t3_jvr7vr,18-11-2020
2401,18,gcorgu3,t1_gcoohnp,"Interesting, I've always thought it is easier to confront as a female. For one, you face much lower risk of the offender getting physically aggressive (it's just not likely any guy will dare to hit a girl in public, and most girls just won't resort to fights just yet). I've always assumes males respond better to females (and in the case of loud music-playing in public, I find many more male offenders).

Could I wonder how young you are? If you are <20, it emboldens inconsiderate people to reject you.

I'm a mid30s male, relatively short in height, not athletic, easily pass of as a brown-skinned ASEAN neighbour. In terms of the social pecking ladder (if I put it bluntly), I would be considered *very low*.

> People playing at HDB game courts have to abide by safe distancing measures, such as maintaining a distance of 1m between groups, and keeping groups to a maximum of five people.

> Intermingling between groups is also prohibited, and members of the public are required to don masks whenever they are not eating, drinking or exercising.

> Basketball and sepak takraw courts closed

> In an Oct. 15 Facebook post, Member of Parliament (MP) in Tampines GRC Baey Yam Keng announced that some basketball and sepak takraw courts in Tampines will be closed for two months.

> The basketball rings have also been removed and the Tampines Town Council might consider removing the sepak takraw net poles.

> Breaking social distancing measures

> Baey explained in his post that the decision was made after residents sent him photos of people playing in close contact without masks and hanging around the courts even when they are not playing.

> Some of the groups had more than five people too.

> There were also cases of them leaving litter behind or making noises late at night.

> Previously, these courts were closed for one month after the Town Council received complaints from residents.

> But the crowds returned when they reopened, said Baey.

> Thus, they will be closed for an extra month this time.

> Baey added in his post:

> ""This is not an ideal solution as this also stops the lone person who just wants to practise his basketball shoots. Small groups of players (five or fewer) will also be affected. However, in the larger public interest, even when we are seeing very few recent community Covid-19 cases, we cannot be complacent. I seek the public and players' understanding to help us tide through this crisis.""

> You can view his full Facebook post here:

> Previous complaints

> In August 2020, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu had also spoken about large gatherings at HDB game courts after receiving complaints and feedback from residents.

> Fu said that the gatherings still occur despite efforts from Safe Distancing Ambassadors and Enforcement Officers.

> Although she understood the importance of leading an active lifestyle, Fu urged people to be mindful of the current Covid-19 pandemic situation.

> She also hoped that people could continue about their sporting activities in a socially responsible way.

Have indoor dining and leisure activities every two weeks. Reason being most infected person show virus within 5-14 days. During the two weeks of “mini phase 1” those who are unwell are to be tested at PHPC nearby.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The message was then further disseminated by the 60-year-old man to other unauthorised recipients, resulting in wider circulation of the information.

> The look-out message was issued at 7.30am on Feb 10 to various law enforcement agencies, after the suspect was identified. The stabbing incident in Tampines was reported at 6.30am.

> That same day, police were alerted to an image of the official document being posted on social media and circulated online via message applications.

> 

> Police investigations are ongoing.

> ""The Government takes a serious view of any wrongful communication of confidential information and will deal firmly with anyone who does so,"" said the police.

> If found guilty of wrongful communication of information under the OSA, the man can be fined up to S$2,000 and jailed up to two years.

> You might have seen news of a Tampines resident at Blk 509 Tampines Central 1 exterminating 323 mosquitoes found in her house, in just one month.

> The resident, Jen, documented the sheer quantity by storing and separating the carcasses in ziploc bags, each labelled with the total number killed in a week.

> On the week of Nov. 20, Jen said she caught a ""record number"" of 103 mosquitoes.

> She explained that the buzzing insects were affecting her ""family's quality of life"", and suspected that they were breeding in an ""overgrown tree"" outside her home.

> Aedes mosquito population decreased since release of Wolbachia mosquitoes

> In response to Mothership's queries, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has revealed that the large swarm of insects likely consist of male Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.

> These mosquitoes do not bite, and were released as part of the agency's efforts to curb the Aedes population in the area.

> Male Wolbachia Aedes mosquitoes are sterile, and when released, will mate with female Aedes mosquitoes, resulting in unfertilised eggs.

> According to NEA, the Wolbachia mosquitoes were first released in Tampines East Constituency in Feb. 2020.

> Since then, there has been a general decrease in the population of Aedes mosquitoes in the constituency.

> The average of between three to four female Aedes mosquitoes caught in every 10 Gravitraps per week, has declined to about one female Aedes mosquito, as of Nov. 2020.

> For the precinct where Blk 509 is located, the Gravitrap surveillance system used to catch about four to five female Aedes mosquitoes in every 10 Gravitraps per week.

> Since the release of male Wolbachia mosquitoes in May 2020, the number caught has halved to two to three female dengue mosquitoes per 10 Gravitraps per week.

> However, there was still a small cluster of two dengue cases in the area recently.

> To prevent further dengue outbreaks, NEA will continue releasing male Wolbachia mosquitoes in the area. The goal is to reach 90 per cent suppression of the Aedes mosquito population.

> Will adjust distribution of Wolbachia mosquito release

> NEA explained that the male mosquitoes sometimes swarm in one area, which was what Jen experienced.

> The agency added that they have reached out to Jen.

> NEA officers have also inspected her home and advised her to spray insecticide to kill any adult mosquitoes.

> They added that they will work with Jen to obtain mosquito samples to further investigate the matter, and will continue to work closely with Tampines Town Council on the feedback about the tree in front of Jen's home.

> ""We understand the inconvenience experienced by some residents in Project Wolbachia areas,"" NEA said.

> To minimise such occurrences of swarming, the distribution of the mosquito release will be adjusted.

> NEA warned that residents may encounter more male Wolbachia mosquitoes on Monday and Friday mornings, which is when the mosquitoes are released.

> In response to feedback on mosquito biting in the area, officers conducted two rounds of checks on Nov. 24 and Dec. 8.

> Officers uncovered two mosquito breeding habitats in a gully trap and flower pot plate.

> NEA said:

> ""NEA would like to remind residents that community vigilance and action remain critical in our fight against dengue, as the Aedes aegyptimosquitoes thrive in the urban environment and the majority of mosquito breeding habitats are still found in homes.""

> They urged residents to continue with the Mozzie Wipeout and to remove all sources of stagnant water.

Er. It has been happening for more than a month. Not really ""sometimes"". 1 day nvm, 1 week can give chance. If they are clusterfucking at one spot for 1 month with over 100 specimens, it shows that they are not really being dispersed efficiently doesnt it? That is more than 2x of the average life span of aedes mosquitos which means the deployment method got problem right? Imagine each time they released 50 at particular deployment location  den the 50 end up getting killed. Effectiveness from that site drops to zero.

Thanks for ad homien attack.

>Secondly, the Wolbachia infected mosquito is one of Singapore’s novel inventions and the most effective method of reducing dengue transmission. The research has been documented for years. 

The wolbachia mosquito itself is not ineffective but the deployment may not. Its like saying the gun is one of most effective killing weapon one can hold but the shooter is a bobo shooter. Does that make weapon lousy? No.

> SINGAPORE: The National Environment Agency (NEA) will release more Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes at three sites between April this year and January 2019. 

> They are Tampines Street 81, Tampines Avenue 4 and Nee Soon East.

> This will mark the second phase of studying the use of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to suppress the Aedes aegypti mosquito population in Singapore, the agency said. 

> Depending on the need, it said more mosquitoes may end up being released compared to the first phase of the study, which began in October 2016.

> During the [first phase of the study](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nea-to-release-bacteria-carrying-mosquitoes-in-former-clusters-t-7893040), NEA released thousands of Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes over a period of six months in Tampines West, Nee Soon East and Braddell Heights.

> NEA said it would be making improvements to its strategies and tactics for release in the second phase, based on the results from Phase 1, which it said yielded “valuable ecological information”.

> MOSQUITOES RELEASED FROM HIGHER GROUND

> The first phase of the study showed that there was 50 per cent reduction of the urban Aedes Aegypti mosquito population at the study sites compared to areas where no infected mosquitoes were released, NEA said.

> Both had a similar Aedes mosquito population prior to the release.

> The mosquito population in the study sites fell because the eggs that are produced when the Wolbachia-infected male mates with uninfected urban Aedes females do not hatch, NEA said.

> But the agency added that the first phase of the study also threw up some challenges.

> For example, Singapore’s densely-packed housing environment saw mosquitoes easily ""migrating"" from surrounding areas into the release sites where the population had fallen.

> In fact, data showed that about 20 per cent of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes were found outside release sites, suggesting that a similar number of urban Aedes mosquitoes would move into the release sites.

> NEA also found that there were mosquito breeding incidents at higher floors of apartment blocks, while the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes released at these sites only flew up to the eighth floor on average.

> Hence, there were not enough infected mosquitoes to suppress the mosquito population on these higher floors.

> NEA said the second phase of the study would involve releasing infected mosquitoes from ground floors as well as high floors of apartment blocks.

> Going forward, it will also limit the release to Tampines West and Nee Soon East, as the Braddell Heights area is mostly made up of landed property.

> To address the movement of mosquitoes, it will extend the release to bigger areas within Tampines West and Nee Soon. 

> RELEASED MOSQUITOES WILL BE X-RAYED TO MITIGATE IMPACT OF INFECTED FEMALE MOSQUITOES IN ENVIRONMENT

> NEA said its current methods of separating the mosquitoes to release only male mosquitoes can also be improved.

> Typically, male pupae are smaller than females, and physically separating infected male mosquitoes from female ones is laborious.

> NEA said its current methodology for large scale sex-sorting results in about 0.3 per cent of infected female mosquitoes being released.

> The agency’s Director-General of Public Health, Derek Ho, said while the presence of infected females will not have much of an impact in the short-run, it could limit NEA’s overall approach of using Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to suppress the population.

> “The Wolbachia itself will have some blocking of the dengue transmission so there is no danger of dengue transmission but in the long-term, we do not want the population of female Wolbachia mosquitoes out there because it just means that in the future, we will not be able to continue to use the release of male Wolbachia mosquitoes to suppress the population,” Mr Ho said.

> That’s because the males will eventually be able to mate with the infected female mosquitoes and produce eggs that hatch into offspring, while NEA&apos;s strategy is to reduce the population of mosquitoes altogether. 

> Going forward, he said mosquitoes released as part of the study will undergo a low-dose X-ray treatment to sterilise any female mosquitoes that are not eliminated through the sex-sorting process.

> “This very low dosage of X-ray that we are using will sterilise the females but will not affect the virility of the males so that even if this very small number of females are released, they will not be able to produce any progeny,” Mr Ho said.

> He added that the sex-sorting is done at the pupae stage, after which the x-ray treatment would be applied.

> Emeritus Professor at Duke-NUS’ Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme, Duane Gubler said the method is tried and tested with positive results. Prof Gubler is also Chair of NEA’s Dengue Expert Advisory Panel.

> “Irradiation has been used for years to successfully sterilise insects for use in sterile male release control trials,” he said.

> “We anticipate that this method will increase the efficacy of the Wolbachia sterilised male approach to mosquito control.”

> MORE MOSQUITOES RELEASED WITH GREATER FREQUENCY

> NEA said it may release a larger population of infected mosquitoes compared to the first phase of study. This is due to a general increase in the mosquito population in 2016.

> The potential increase will also address the movement of both infected and urban mosquitoes in and out of the field sites.

> As an example, about one to six male mosquitoes per person could be released each week, as opposed to one in three mosquitoes per person in the first phase of study.

> NEA found that the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes also survived an average of four days in the field. Therefore, to sustain their population, it said it would need to release the required number more frequently.

> The agency said it will now release the mosquitoes twice a week compared to once weekly during the first phase. It would also release mosquitoes at an earlier stage of their life cycle to give them more time to survive at the study sites.

> Results from phase two of the study would “strengthen” NEA’s planning for a larger suppression trial, which was delayed due to the challenges that surfaced in the initial phase.

> NEA said researchers will set up mosquito traps and pupal containers at various locations within the study sites, and urged members of the public not to remove or tamper with these traps.

> It said it would provide residents with more information to residents at the study sites before April.

It is of my own personal opinion that no one should ever feel the pain of being backed into a corner with no way of reaching for help. That the only logical conclusion that they can come to in order to end the pain is by death.Until the day comes that the stigma is gone, the people who are living need to speak for them.Dead people do not have a voice to speak up against the stigma they faced, that is the job for the living.Sorry if i appear pompous by this post but this is a personal pet peeve of mine.",t3_8yqj7z,14-07-2018

Do you want to flood the feedback with this opinion of yours that you feel strongly about, to let HIS parents see from everywhere and tell them “if only you didn’t say he chap keng and man up a few days/hours/minutes earlier”?

For all we know (note: only one of many scenarios... we both know nothing on this case) that kid has a support network of kind family and supportive close friends. He is just hit with something big enough for him to ignore them all before he jumped.

Or maybe he is the target of all those anti-gambling adverts. He’s a Ben, he sees his future in the radio. Thus he jumped, despite the advert’s message to “seek help”.

Or many others possibilities, and only a percent of those includes society’s “must be chao keng” opinions suppressing the kid...

... which only really directly occurs in workplaces and places of unwilling work, such as NS.

Meanwhile, keep the bird WARM. If you have a basking light for reptiles, shining it towards half the cage helps. Those are just bulbs you can easily find in pet shops (about $30 iirc). It cannot be a normal bulb, as you will just keep the bird awake instead. Keep the cage covered and in a quiet area so the bird can rest and recover.

For food, try to find millet sprays at a pet shop. It's a snack that parrots love. That bird probably has not been eating much, so it's important to build up its energy.

Bird also likely has diarrhea from eating stuff outside (watery poop). You  need a vet's attention for that. I don't know of any in the east, but if you're willing to travel, I recommend Dr Gloria from Mount Peasant Mandai.",t3_ijrw5y,31-08-2020

If the bird has a leg ring, do not post the details of the leg ring in your post. If someone claims the bird to be theirs, you can get them to provide the leg ring number for you to verify. (Not the other way around)

Also, don’t stress the bird out too much. Let it get used to you and the surroundings by giving it space, after all it should be very stressed being in a new environment.

> SINGAPORE: Member of Parliament (MP) for Tampines GRC Baey Yam Keng drew fire on Thursday (Jan 11) for an Instagram post warning residents about increased stray dog sightings in the neighbourhood. 

> Mr Baey had shared a video of four dogs mingling in the rain at Tampines Street 45 in his post, adding that the Tampines Town Council had reported the situation to the Agri-food and Veterinary Authority&apos;s (AVA) Animal Response Centre. 

> He also advised residents who come across the dogs to alert AVA&apos;s Animal Response Centre and shared ""tips"" on what to do should one encounter stray dogs. 

> Not long after he put up the post, hundreds of comments flooded his page, with the majority of social media users questioning the MP&apos;s decision to involve AVA. 

> One user known as Berryblob said he was ""deeply troubled"" by the post, which he described as ""only contributing to mass hysteria"". 

> ""We are the ones who robbed these harmless creatures of their natural habitat. We made them homeless and now we are taking their lives. Is this what the Tampines Kindness Movement is about?,"" said the user, adding that he volunteered at a local animal welfare organisation.

> ""I hope you&apos;re seeing all these messages and that you will acknowledge the issue publicly. Residents must be educated the right way,"" the user wrote.

> Another user, Stanleyssn, said: ""Why not educate people on how to deal (with) and take care of strays instead of making these strays sound so anti-social and vicious? As an MP, do you know what AVA will do when they catch the strays? Educate and not instill fear in the residents."" 

> ""MY DUTY TO ASSURE THEM""

> Responding to the comments, Mr Baey put up another post late on Thursday, saying that he felt ""heartened"" to know that there were so many people who cared for the stray dogs. 

> He added that he had received the video clip from a resident and that the Town Council had received several emails asking for action.

> ""As an MP, it is my duty to assure them,"" he said. 

> ""I shared the AVA advisory so that residents know how to react and not cause undue distress to the dogs ... Residents’ safety is important and AVA as the national agency for wild animals has to be alerted.""

> Mr Baey also assured in the post that culling would only be administered as a ""last resort"", bringing up AVA&apos;s Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage programme. 

> ""Please be assured that Tampines does not support culling of dogs,"" he said. ""We will work with animal welfare groups to foster and rehome these animals. If you know of anyone who can help, do let me know."" 

> Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng, who is also the founder of the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society, left a comment on Mr Baey&apos;s second post, thanking users for their input. 

> ""I too share your concerns about culling and I&apos;m so happy that AVA will be rolling out a brand new sterilisation programme to manage the stray population,"" said Mr Ng.

> ""It has taken us a long time to achieve this, but a lot of changes have been made in the past few years and a lot of progress has been made. There is lots more to do and I will continue speaking up about this issue in Parliament. 

> ""I can also assure you that Yam Keng is equally concerned about the welfare of animals,"" he added.

> Mr Ng also said in response to queries from Channel NewsAsia that the comments made by the public on Mr Baey&apos;s posts is a positive thing.

> ""I think it is always positive that people are speaking up and voicing their concerns. It shows they care and that it important for Singapore,"" he added.

If a dog displays any sort of bad behavior, it's assumed that it's the owner's fault (ie ""there are no terrible dogs, just terrible owners""). In reality, dogs are animals with animal instincts.

I think it's not ok to force others to share your beliefs and non-beliefs. Convince, tolerate or just ignore if their world views don't fit yours.

> SINGAPORE — The five teenagers who were arrested for allegedly trespassing at Ikea Tampines early Sunday morning were believed to have been inspired by a 24-hour challenge on social media, the Swedish furniture company told TODAY on Monday (April 1).

> The youths — aged between 16 and 18 — were found hiding in the building after the store had closed at 11pm the previous night.

> An Ikea spokesperson told TODAY that the youths “did not damage property or make an attempt to steal from our store”.

> “We do not believe they intended to harm Ikea. We believe this (is a) case of trespass inspired by a 24-hour challenge on social media,” said the spokesperson, who nevertheless added that the store will be stepping up security to ensure that there are no copy-cat repeats of the incident.

> The challenge the spokesperson was referring to calls on participants to reach a location or venue before it closes for the evening and trespass on the property by creating a fort. It is known to have been started by two teenagers in Belgium who had hid in an Ikea store there.

> The group of five teenagers were believed to have hidden during Ikea Tampines’ 11pm closing time, and had not been “spotted during the night-time round by (Ikea’s) duty manager and security,” the spokesperson said.

> “Our store spans 36,000 square metres and the kids involved managed to hide from our security guards and CCTV cameras at the time of closing,” he added.

> Ikea also plans to “write to the police investigative branch to ask for leniency” on behalf of the teenagers.

> “These kids made a serious mistake that posed a risk to their own safety and we take it seriously but we also have a company culture that allows people to make mistakes — as long as we learn from them,” said the spokesperson.

> He added: “We know that Ikea feels like home and many people come to Ikea to have a great day out — but unsanctioned sleepovers are simply not safe, given the warehouse operations and heavy equipment in our building. The safety of people in our store is our top priority.”

> SINGAPORE - A strong burning smell was reported over several parts of eastern Singapore on Friday morning (Feb 8), including Tampines, Bedok and Pasir Ris.

> Mr Jon Lee, 45, who lives in Tampines, likened the smell to the haze or offerings being burnt during the Chinese seventh month.

> ""I was taking my son to school on the way to work at around 6am, and there was a strong burning smell. At 7am, when I dropped my son off in the East Coast area, it was still there,"" said Mr Lee, who works in sales.

> He told The Straits Times that there was no burning smell when he reached his workplace in the west. He added that his colleague who lives in Bedok also described a similar burning smell.

> A reader, who wished to be known only as Ms Tan, said she noticed the smell when she reached the void deck of her Tampines home after 7am.

> ""The smell was pretty strong, and when I got to the bus stop I could see that it was a bit hazy. Things looked blurry from a distance,"" said the 24-year-old trainee teacher.

> Another reader who did not wish to be named also said she noticed a strong burning smell. She said the smell was similar to the haze.

> Related Story ST readers complain of strong burning smell in the east of Singapore

> ""I smelled it once I woke up around 7.30am and stepped out of my room. I went to the balcony to see if someone was burning something, but I didn't really see anything,"" said the 23-year-old, who works in public relations.

> Netizens posting on online forum Reddit said that Simei, Pasir Ris, Bedok, Tampines and Marine Parade were among the areas affected, from as early as 3am for some.

> Facebook user Han Han, in a post at about 7.25am, said it smelled like ""burnt leaves"".

> When ST reached the Tampines area at about 8.30am, a strong burning smell was in the air.

> Some pedestrians were spotted donning face masks at Tampines Central Park.

> The air around the park was visibly hazy, with buildings in the distance appearing unclear and obscured.

> At about 10am, the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) value listed on the National Environment Agency's (NEA's) website was 63, which is in the ""moderate"" range of 51 to 100.

> The figure for the east at 10am was higher than for other regions, which were 26 for the west, 35 in the north, 46 for the central region and 53 in the south.

> The one-hour PM2.5 reading at 10am was 62 for eastern Singapore, which is within the ""elevated"" range of 56 to 150. PM2.5 is the dominant pollutant during haze episodes, according to the NEA.

> The NEA's data showed that PM2.5 readings for the east have been increasing steadily, from 48 at 2am to 60 at 9am.

> The other PM2.5 readings at 10am were seven for the west, 14 in north, 13 for the central region and 10 in the south.

> As of 9am, the Singapore Civil Defence Force said it had not received any reports of incidents that may have caused the smell.

> ST has contacted the NEA for more information.

This would be very expensive for her family, ""painful"" for the patient, and from a social justice perspective might also be retaining resources for others who might better utilize the facility and care.

3040,18,e04khnk,t1_e04akhj,"Logically, you are right. But you're not their family. Pulling plug out of the life sustaining machine of a loved one is a difficult decision due to emotions, illogical decisions (driven by emotions for e.g.), hope (not unheard of people refusing to pull for extended period) and other things. 

But as outsiders, we should let them come to their own decision. We have no rights to go into the room and say, hi I'm u/unusualist, please pull the plug already. It is best for you. Anyway I'm just passing by and saying my opinion. Bye.

No, that is disrespectful and insensitive. Keep it to yourself, to your friends, family, colleagues and acquaintances, but not to anything that their family members could chance upon on. Additional unnecessary emotional stress. ",t3_8ohgjk,05-06-2018
3041,18,e06x94r,t1_e06dl8l,"ah, i work in private so i guess it works a bit differently. our patients’ relatives tend to not want to pull the plug so we need to go maximum support till pretty much all the organs fail. ",t3_8ohgjk,06-06-2018
3042,18,e04w52j,t1_e04nc3i,"Yes. Apparently extubation to comfort care is the obvious choice for everyone. 

Now Ive seen it all! ",t3_8ohgjk,05-06-2018
3043,18,e04w2qa,t1_e04khnk,"Well you are an odd one. 

You insinuate that such a decision is obvious which I completely disagree with because everyone has different values. There will be families that believe in prolonged life support, families that believe there is no value living on a temporary trach, and most people are going to be somewhere in between. Hence this will be a very challenging decision to make for most people in this situation. 

Like I said hopefully they can come to a decision soon because the process can be painful, not just emotionally but also physically. 

This is no different to any other piece of news discussed on Reddit. If you believe that an outsider should have no opinions then perhaps stop browsing Reddit and getting triggered. 

It is unlikely in this scenario but Im sure there are always threads where different opinions have helped enlighten other Redditors and hopefully mine will be no different for when someone is harmed. 

Now if I was discussing options and outcomes with my patient it will be a lengthy and elaborate face to face conversation with questions and answers. You should have the awareness that this is not that environment. 

And no you are absolutely wrong because many times patients will seek advice from their medical practitioners and it is then their perogative to decide what they want to share. In this apparently cut and dry situation I cannot imagine any practitioner offering trachpeg. Once again, this is not the unit. This is reddit. None of us here need to have the ability nor experince of leading these discussions to share their opinions.

Apart from that, you appeared very callous and insensitive to the people calling you out on your opinion. It isn't about having opinions, it's about having the common sense and empathy to keep some opinions to yourself at the appropriate times.

Ironic that you're lecturing someone about how to properly approach and discuss life support options with a patient, when you are not reflecting on your own performance and behavior and unable to see why people might be disagreeing with your opinion. ",t3_8ohgjk,05-06-2018

3047,18,e06exhl,t1_e06bw9i,"Im not sure if you read my prior post but if you wanted to preface everything you comment on with a thesis paper you should really refrain from coming onto reddit less you get triggered. 

Reddit functions as a system where a singular post obtains a conglomeration of comments, most without evidence. I could similarly argue that your lack of perceived medical knowledge limits any valuable discussion. Of course, that is hardly the case and because I consider everyone equal, Reddit or not. 

Just for you I will reiterate myself one last time. There is a time and place for everything. This is not the hospital. You arent sitting in front of the family. Please do not write two paragraphs of emotions prior to getting to your point because this is not right place, does not contribute to the familys welfare, and neither is it a valuable discussion compared to discussions we have, albeit triggered from one or two, about comfort care, organ donation etc 

If you want to have empathy focused discussions on those you can go to the hospital and speak with family. Dont come online because you never know when someone might cuss your mom to get cancer! 

It is truly unbelievable how you have been unable to differentiate the hospital patient setting and an online forum. Expectations and topics of discussion are inherently different and I recommend you not be triggered by an opinion of extubation to comfort care for the wrong reasons.

> SINGAPORE: The former Qiaonan Primary School site has been refurbished to house foreign workers in essential services, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) said on Friday (May 29).

> The site at 15 Tampines Street 11 can accommodate about 500 people and has recently started to receive workers, a SLA spokesperson said.

> Moving healthy foreign workers to temporary facilities has been part of the Government’s strategy to curb the spread of COVID-19.

> In April, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that migrant workers who were not sick and were working in essential services would be housed separately from those in dormitories.

> 

> Military camps, Changi Exhibition Centre, vacant HDB flats and offshore floating lodging were among the sites selected as potential living quarters.

> Some vacant state properties - based on their existing infrastructure and size - have been identified as suitable options as well, according to the SLA spokesperson.

> 

> The spokesperson said that ""all necessary measures"" have been put in place for the safety of the workers moving into the Tampines sites and for the community.

> “The site is gated, with controlled access and security patrol,"" the authority's spokesperson said.

> 

> ""On-site amenities including a minimart for workers to purchase necessities and meals will be provided for the well-being of the workers.""

> The workers will have to observe safe distancing measures when staying within the former school site at all times and only leave the facility for work using transport arranged by their employers, the spokesperson added.

> 

> Inside the temporary facility. SLA said that there is a minimart on-site for workers to purchase necessities, while meals will be provided to the workers. (Photo: Singapore Land Authority).

> In 2014, Qiaonan Primary School closed and merged with Griffiths Primary School to form Angsana Primary School the following year.

> Other former school sites used to house healthy foreign workers include the former Hong Kah Secondary School and Bedok North Secondary School, according to a Ministry of Education response to CNA last week.

> The former Chancery Court condominium at 36 Dunearn Road is another place where healthy foreign workers in essential services are currently staying. It can hold up to 1,200 workers.

> On Friday, Singapore reported 611 new COVID-19 cases, taking the country's total number of infections to 33,860. Most of the infections are linked to foreign workers living in dormitories.

> SINGAPORE - The Housing Board has launched 4,089 flats for sale on Wednesday (Sept 11), one day after Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced higher grants and higher income ceilings for flat buyers.

> A total of 3,373 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats in Punggol and Tampines are up for sale, and they range from two-room flexi to five-room flats.

> Prices start from $109,000 (excluding grants) for a two-room flexi flat in Punggol, and from $312,000 (excluding grants) for a four-room flat in Tampines.

> The HDB noted that with the new Enhanced CPF Housing Grant giving eligible first-timer families with a monthly income of up to $9,000 up to $80,000, buyers could buy a two-room flexi flat in Punggol for as little as $29,000 after housing grants.

> Also up for sale are 716 Re-Offer of Balance Flats in mature and non-mature estates. These are unsold flats from the sales exercise last November.

> About 12 per cent of these are already completed, while the rest are under construction.

> The HDB said those with more urgent housing needs or who are less particular about flat attributes may wish to apply for these flats.

> Application for the flats opens from Wednesday and will end on Sept 17.

> In November, the HDB will offer another 4,500 BTO flats in Ang Mo Kio, Tampines and Tengah. A further 3,000 BTO flats in Sembawang and Toa Payoh will be released next February.

> In a Facebook post on Wednesday after the HDB announced the sale of the flats, Mr Wong said: ""With the enhancements announced... more first-timer home buyers will be able to access affordable housing options. I encourage you to consider your options carefully and make prudent housing choices. ""

3240,18,f4z62ut,t3_dm9mzi,"Ive lived in tampines for majority of my life and let me tell you that this place has everything.

Malls in Singapore are generic and have the same shops in every mall. Tampines has 3 large malls centered around the train station and there's really no reason to leave tampines for whatever reason. There's even an IKEA, a courts mega store (similar to Walmart I guess?) within tampines.

School wise there isn't any elite or ivy league school so to speak. They're pretty average.",t3_dm9mzi,24-10-2019
3241,18,f4z6wca,t3_dm9mzi,"Depending on the age of your kids they will likely really struggle in the local school system. It is very different than N. American schools. Be prepared to spend a lot in tuition. 
International schools are less intense, but very expensive, unless your company is paying for school fees.


I agree with the other person mentioning Simei, it is a bit less crowded than Tampines. The Changi MRT is for the airport, I don't know where the shipyard is. Unless you mean Changi Depot. Then for sure you want to live in Simei or near Simpang Bedok.

Getting a nanny is quite easy and affordable, they live with you.
 A vehicle to fit 7 people will probably cost you at least $1500 a month for something very basic and a few years old.  If you are buying, you will need around 20-30k for downpayment. 


Also do note you have to still pay Uncle Sam while you are living here.",t3_dm9mzi,24-10-2019
3242,18,f4yydrz,t3_dm9mzi,"Well it depends on where exactly you are working. Based on Google maps, The Shipyard would be somewhat closer to Simei area. 
As someone who lives in the east, I would suggest Simei rather than Tampines both for price of housing and also because Tampines is really crowded because of the 3 malls in the area.

If you are however talking about the shipyard closer to Changi village side, then your alternative might be Pasir Ris instead. There are many food and amenities available there, and buses run quite regularly towards the Changi side. Overall, I would say Tampines is a little more pricier than Pasir Ris in consideration of accessibility and price. If you need to head to Ikea, Giant or Courts for your groceries or furniture and you drive, The area around Pasir Ris grove is quite decent. Close enough to town center for whatever you need on a short grocery run, and nearby schools for your kids if you have any. 

If your company would be providing housing options for you, I do realise a lot of them like to situate the expats around the Changi Business Park region, but that would not be as accessible if you have to head to ferry terminal area quite regularly unless you drive so do take note of that! 

Hope you enjoy your stay in Singapore! :)",t3_dm9mzi,24-10-2019

Best sch in Pasir Ris is Hai Sing Catholic (quite near the interchange and downtown east and a sports complex and the Pasir Ris park not town park. Pasir Ris park)

Best schs in Tampines are Ngee Ann secondary or St Hilda Primary /Secondary

Best primary schs are pretty much the same. But for secondary schools I'm basing it on PSLE COP. Likely MOE will place your kids in some random sch nearby hopefully.

1. Tampines grew to be quite a large kampong after the war. More people = more temples. Remember they didn't all start as large permanent buildings. Many start as a single shrine or makeshift structure to mark a location or event. So it's not surprising to have dozens of ""temples"" in a kampong. The ones that gain patronage build up over time.

2. Tampines Town development in '70s and '80s forced many things to move, including temples. There is a Tampines Chinese Temple nearby which was formed from many previous temples. Presumably some others were allowed to move to Tampines Link at the outskirts of the town, or elsewhere.

> SINGAPORE - Caltex Singapore is investigating an incident on Saturday (April 14) involving an elderly pump attendant from its petrol kiosk in Tampines Avenue 8, after he offered to pay $125 for a customer&apos;s full tank of petrol due to an alleged mistake.

> In response to the incident, which has since gone viral on Facebook, Caltex Singapore reassured motorists that the attendant ""did not bear any financial obligation"".

> Facebook user Willie Kok Heng Chua [link is removed] involving a BMW driver in a post on Saturday night, and it has since gone viral with more than 24,000 shares and 6,700 comments within 12 hours.

> In the post, he said the BMW driver claimed that the pump attendant had mistakenly refilled his car with a full tank, which costs about $135, even though he had only asked for $10 worth of petrol.

> When the driver insisted that he would only fork out $10, the pump attendant, who looked to be in his 60s, told the cashier that he would personally bear the rest of the bill.

> The pump attendant explained to the cashier that he had heard the driver mention that he wanted a full tank refill. This was rebutted by the driver.

> Many netizens, like Mr Kok, wondered if the driver could have responded more graciously by paying for the petrol, as he would have used it anyway.

> The Caltex petrol station along Tampines Avenue 1, where the incident allegedly took place. PHOTO: SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS

> Others also asked if Caltex Singapore would allow the pump attendant to pay just a partial amount, even if it was a genuine mistake.

> Caltex Singapore said in its Facebook post that it is heartened by the solidarity and care shown towards its Tampines team.

> ""Do be assured that our station manager, together with the management team are looking into this issue now and an investigation is ongoing,"" it said.

> Chinese-language newspaper Shin Min Daily News reported on Sunday that several motorists and nearby residents had visited the petrol kiosk to offer the pump attendant some money.

> A regular customer, who gave his name as Mr Wang, said that he wanted to help as he recognised that working in a petrol kiosk can be tough, and at times, mistakes may occur.

> Caltex Singapore also advised the public to refrain from commenting about the driver or those involved while its team is looking into the incident.

> SINGAPORE - The National Solidarity Party (NSP) intends to contest Tampines GRC, Sembawang GRC and the Pioneer and MacPherson single seats at the next general election.

> NSP secretary-general Spencer Ng on Sunday (March 22) said his party would contest the same constituencies that it did in GE2015.

> He will lead a team to contest in Sembawang, and party president Reno Fong will helm another team to stand in Tampines, Mr Ng told reporters during a walkabout in Tampines Street 81.

> Party members distributed hand sanitiser to members of the public, including shopkeepers.

> So far, about 10 party members are interested in standing for election, and the NSP is still reviewing them before unveiling its slate of candidates, Mr Ng added.

> The applicants include entrepreneurs and professionals from the IT and logistics sectors who are aged between the late 20s and early 50s, he said.

> The NSP joins a growing number of opposition parties that have indicated where they will contest for the GE, which is expected to be held in the next few months following the release of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee's report earlier this month.

> Most parties have said they would run in the constituencies that they contested in 2015.

> But the entry of newly formed Progress Singapore Party (PSP), led by former People's Action Party veteran MP Tan Cheng Bock, has raised the possibility of multi-cornered fights.

> The PSP earlier indicated that it would contest 15 constituencies, including West Coast GRC, Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, Sembawang GRC, Pioneer SMC, Radin Mas SMC and the new Marymount SMC.

> The NSP, Reform Party (RP) and Singapore People’s Party (SPP) have staked their claim on these constituencies as well.

> RP said in a post on its Facebook page on Saturday (March 21) that it ""will continue to serve the residents by contesting in West Coast GRC, Ang Mo Kio GRC and Radin Mas SMC"".

> SPP has said it will field candidates in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC as well as Potong Pasir, Marymount and Mountbatten SMCs.

> Party chairman Jose Raymond will be its candidate in Potong Pasir, while secretary-general Steve Chia will lead a team to contest in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.

> Singapore Democratic Alliance chairman Desmond Lim Bak Chuan told The Straits Times that the party will be contesting in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

> The party has contested there since 2006 and has been working the ground since, he added.

> ""We will continue to contest in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC... We suggest (for opposition parties) to go elsewhere. Don't duplicate our actions and waste resources,"" Mr Lim said.

> NSP's Mr Ng said his party is set to meet PSP on Monday for talks, adding that while multi-cornered fights risk duplicating resources, they are a sign of democracy at work. ""It's kind of messy, but that's democracy,"" he said.

> His party could see a three-way fight in Tampines GRC as well, as the Workers' Party has been seen walking the ground there. The WP has yet to announce the wards it will be contesting.

> Related Story Singapore GE: Tan Cheng Bock set to contest West Coast GRC as PSP eyes 15 constituencies

> Singaporeans First secretary-general Tan Jee Say said his party is discussing where to contest.

> People's Power Party secretary-general Goh Meng Seng said he had no comments when asked where his party planned to contest in.

> For almost two years, a small project staged at the void deck of a Tampines Housing Board block has been quietly contributing to the needy.

> Under a grassroots initiative named My Kind Of Fridge, two full-sized refrigerators and one freezer stand at the void deck of Block 441 Tampines Street 43 for the public to donate fresh food, be it vegetables, fish, meat, eggs or fruits, for needy residents of Blocks 441 and 442.

> Member of Parliament for Tampines GRC and chairman of Tampines Town Council Baey Yam Keng told The Sunday Times yesterday that the initiative, which began in January last year, is supported by the town council.

> Mr Baey, 48, explained: ""There were initially just two refrigerators. The freezer was added subsequently as a group of fishing enthusiasts has been donating their catch and requested for more space.""

> He added that there are about 100 rental units in the two blocks the refrigerators serve. The refrigerators, which are open round the clock, have signs that say: ""Take what you need. Leave some for neighbours in need.""

> From photographs of the initiative posted on Facebook, at least one of the refrigerators has a halal sign. The freezer also has a sign that says no pork is allowed as it is reserved for the donation of fish.

> Residents are not the only ones contributing to the initiative. Mr Baey posted on his Twitter account last Tuesday that a restaurant donated five baskets of vegetables.

> Netizens are responding well to the initiative.

> Facebook user and fishing enthusiast Albert Lim commented on a post about the initiative: ""Let's all do it together to benefit more people! (The best) fishing kakis (Malay word which can mean buddy) are donating to the fridge constantly too!""

> An earlier version of this report said that the refrigerators are located at Block 441 of Tampines Avenue 10. It should be Block 441 Tampines Street 43. We are sorry for the error.

> SINGAPORE - A new initiative launched by Tampines GRC will see about 500 low- to middle-income families receive discounted groceries for the next year.

> The Tampines Project 100=50 initiative, which was launched on Sunday (Aug 25) at Arena @ OTH, offers these households the opportunity to pick out their own groceries and receive a discount on their final bill.

> The total subsidy received by recipients is capped at 50 per cent of the total bill or at $50, whichever is lower.

> As part of the initiative, a pop-up supermarket will be set up at Arena @ OTH every last Sunday of the month.

> Here, recipients can choose from about 330 grocery items including laundry supplies, canned food, frozen food, personal care items, rice and oil.

> Organised in partnership with Sheng Siong Supermarket and the Heartwarmers Volunteer Group, the initiative sells grocery items at cost price.

> Speaking to the media at the launch, Mayor of North East District Desmond Choo said this project differs from those that deliver grocery items to low-income households.

> He said that when items are delivered, families sometimes end up overloaded with particular products that they might not be able to use.

> ""Here, the residents can get things that they really need below the usual supermarket prices. This will allow them to save on cost as well as reduce wastage,"" he said.

> As to whether the initiative will be expanded to the larger North East district, he said: ""This is something we are evaluating very closely. There are certainly plans, depending on the outcome of the GRC project here, to expand to other parts of the North East district, especially those that have a higher number of lower-income residents, including parts of Kaki Bukit and Bedok.""

> A year-long pilot for the initiative was launched in July last year in the Tampines North constituency.

> The pilot helped about 150 families a month with their grocery shopping. Due to its success,the project has now been scaled up to a GRC-level initiative.

> Beneficiaries of Tampines Project 100=50 are identified by the five Community Development and Welfare Fund Committees (CDWFs) in Tampines.
