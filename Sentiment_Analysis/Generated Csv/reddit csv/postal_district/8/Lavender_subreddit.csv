I’m a foreigner who visited Singapore last week and left a few things behind in a locker in my hostel in Lavender, including my wallet. Reception hasn’t exactly offered me any solutions regarding its return. I’m hoping there is someone nearby who wouldn’t mind grabbing it and safeguarding it for me until I figure out what the heck to do next? Maybe taking a picture so I can inventory what I’ve left behind? I’ve cancelled all the cards in there and there shouldn’t be any money or anything of value to anyone but me. I would just like to be reunited my drivers license, my work visa and the contact cards of all the friends I’ve met along the way!

Let me know if this is something you can do or if you have any ideas about what I should do next in this situation.

Thanks!"
