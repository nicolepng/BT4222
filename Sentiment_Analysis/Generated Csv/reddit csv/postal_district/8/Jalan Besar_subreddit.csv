0,8,[Unpopular Opinion] PV's Jalan Besar broadcast was the best decision for them,117,hllgkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hllgkv/unpopular_opinion_pvs_jalan_besar_broadcast_was/,37,05-07-2020,"Now disclaimer: I'm not a politics junkie nor am I super 'into' politics

But as a layman, I can't help but feel somewhat impressed at the speech given by PV Sec-Gen Lim Tean even though he basically hogged the entire 12 minutes

I feel that points raised by him actually kind of made sense, but the Covid-19 conspiracy theories about the virus being a bio-weapon was kind of questionable - even if used as a rhetorical question 

Also I think it's kind of ballsy to spend a substantial part of the broadcast slamming Josephine Teo for her previous comments and actions

Regardless of how everyone thinks, I feel that him mentioning the reserved presidency was also floating a talking point that merits some sort of discussion.

Although I have to say that he really could have let others speak, given how his party's name is you know, Peoples Voice?

As a orator though, I feel his delivery was on point too.

What do you all think?"
