You can try to observe the next time you are at the platform. If one of the lights doesn't go off, the train will not move, and sometimes the doors will quickly open and then close again, in an attempt to get the doors to close or to release anything possibly trapped in the doors. 

For the DTL, it is the same. The train will not move off until both the platform screen doors and the train doors have been confirmed to have been shut, but I believe the DTL does it slightly differently. 

If the platform doors are detected to not be properly closed, but the train doors are closed, it will only reopen and close the platform doors, which is what happened here.

A paternoster (, , or ) or paternoster lift is a passenger elevator which consists of a chain of open compartments (each usually designed for two persons) that move slowly in a loop up and down inside a building without stopping. Passengers can step on or off at any floor they like. The same technique is also used for filing cabinets to store large amounts of (paper) documents or for small spare parts. The much smaller belt manlift which consists of an endless belt with steps and rungs but no compartments is also sometimes called a paternoster.

Another common example is that of people pushing prams or other wheeled devices onto escalators, despite clear signs indicating not to do so. This has caused escalator steps to dislodge in quite a few malls already.",t3_cwebdp,28-08-2019

Yes, safety systems can save lives, but that does not change the fact someone was stupid enough to put their life at risk.

444,8,eybvc7r,t1_eybr08u,"I'm not explicitly wishing harm. There is a consequence for everything which mostly remains neutral.

In this case, the consequence of my wife getting sucked into an escalator for not tying her shoes is neutral towards everything. She did not wish for harm and neither did I nor the escalator. It is simply an unfortunate accident. Sure, the escalator could have a safety system where it automatically stops when it detects something getting jammed in it, but ultimately, no one person or thing is at fault or to blame.

The difference between the escalator example and the train is that one is an accident while one is a stupid, deliberate attempt. 

You can implement the most advanced safety systems for the former and it will be justified because an accident is mostly out of control and unintentional.

What is not justified is implementing the same systems for deliberate acts of stupidity because they are intentional and within the control of the individual.

When you say that systems should be in place to protect the safety of people in a situation like this where safety is under their control and a choice, you are indirctly tolerating the act by reducing the consequences of said act. Dire consequences should be prevented regardless of the reason of the act, but not to the point where consequence is effectively absolved.

How am I wishing harm upon someone when they are putting themselves in harms way?

And I would like you to look deeper into the consequences of using technology to combat idiocy. 

If consequences were to be effectively removed for commiting a dangerous or stupid act, it can send a message that said act is more do-able which then becomes more tolerable. Eventually we won't even have to think about any significant risk or consequence, dumbing us down.

They‚Äôre seen as symbols of prosperity, given how they auspiciously grow in muddy waters. There‚Äôs also a recorded extensive use of the lotus flower in paintings of deities that gained more traction during the end of the British Raj, such as with Raja Ravi Varma using lotuses on goddesses and aristocratic women in his paintings, that really trickled down to the masses. It has a very heavy association with the goddess Lakshmi- she represents prosperity or wealth. All in all, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs no clear one answer to this because Hinduism isn‚Äôt as much of a codified religion like the Abrahamic faiths but a collection of various beliefs that fall under similar themes across the Indian subcontinent so I‚Äôm sure you might get different answers but this is just my understanding of it.",t3_jbkhhg,16-10-2020

717,8,fhkqw4f,t1_fhk132f,"Little India has a very good variety and quality of Briyani .Here are some of the briyani I enjoy  .Somedays I like one more than the other

Mamaris $8.
Current favourite.Good raita and they have some unique pickle sauce which goes well. But it‚Äôs not too impt. The rice is well cooked and served hot(probably reheated but doesn‚Äôt matter since taste good). Chicken is good .also served with egg.Kerala brothers have modeled their restaurant to look Arab Stesque with nice deco and Spotify yet at dunlop street prices. They have some unique  tasting mango and papaya milk shakes as well. Together with Bismillah and ‚ÄòThe Singapura Club‚Äô they are bound to make dunlop street food haven for all(travelers,cafe hoppers,hipsters ,locals, FTs,FWs).

Courtallam Border Rahmath $10.
Good briyani. Some unique sauce and gravy. Very very good raita and also egg 

Bismillah (forgot the price ...is it $10?).
North Indian style.good and has a different kind of raita. Bismillah is definitely top 3 but too expensive for regular consumption.also give a bit of overrated feeling since everyone blindly throng them. They are good but not the best.Also used to frequent their Simei outlet while it was still there. 

Tiffin bhavan $8
Decent stuff for cheap eat. But can be inconsistent. Raita is ok. Some times not so hot(heat is crucial for briyani).Fish briyani on Sundays are something special .only eat between 1230-1400 hrs

Bhai briyani / Tip-Top Briyani ($8)
So so stuff. But can still be eaten .raita is there for people who care

 Anjappar (forgot the price) Expensive and decent.Also Gayatri is good. Just a tad expensive. Reliable and consistent .

Thalapakaty $12.
Expensive and ok. But serves the unique seeraga samba rice. Some don‚Äôt consider this as briyani. Pepperi style. Can be eaten once a while for the unique feel. Rare craves.

Islamic $12.
Not really little India. Very consistent and served hot.would eat more often if price is lower. My japanese colleague loved it somehow. 

Nandhanas (Boon Lay) $12.
Expensive. But lovely briyani at western end of Singapore. Always dine there whenever at joo khoon area for work. Namdhanas is one of the better places at joo khoon mall that even non Indians frequent there. 

Akshaya (ARC) I think $12.
Very good briyani at mapletree business park. Large serving. Lots of people struggle to finish.

Koothur(no sign-board shop at beach road.doesnt look appealing) $6.50 ?
Used to be favorite. Still decent briyani for cheap price.

Special Mention to Crave Nasi Lemak. They serve briyani(basmati) rice for Nasi lemak. Rice cooked well and served hot. Also cheap buy and wide availability. I just eat the rice by itself. Kudos to the owner for doing things right.one of a kind franchise it is. 

And this one briyani which i am excited to try in the future. Always busy and crowded.‚ÄôMr Briyani‚Äô at cuff road. Also seems like they serve good tea or masala chai(though I have my own favorite list for masala chai) . And this hipster Instagram briyani ‚ÄòMat Soul Kitchen‚Äô. Getting rave reviews. Wanna try his briyani and also his original inspiration Pak Liyari(Pakistan /Dubai).newly openly hipster cafe They Singapura Club‚Äô(dunlop at) offering also looks interesting. 

Briyanis I don‚Äôt enjoy that much ,All the $5.5 Tekka market briyani. 
Alaudin briyani. Just taste like msg.though it‚Äôs locals favorite. Just don‚Äôt enjoy it that much.Alaudin briyani appeals to people who hate spices and all the bits(cloves and cardamom ) but that‚Äôs what really makes a briyani. (Kashmiri and parsi briyani has abundant sweet lovely stuff ) ..more stuff =more awesome flavors=more awesome briyani .But still congrats to Alaudin for having their loyal share of regulars and customers with consistent stuff.also Crave and eat Zam Zam and Victory briyani once a while although overrated for their fan following. Sakunthala‚Äôs is overrated with overpowering masala taste in all their meat. 

Please share other good briyani spots",t3_f3o8ew,14-02-2020

> ‚ÄúHe loved his mother. He would bring his mother to go out to see the doctor, and will go out to buy food for her daily too,‚Äù he added.

> The last time he spoke to the man was on Sunday, when they discussed the Home Improvement Programme. Renovation works for their two units were supposed to begin on Thursday.

> ‚ÄúI know them for so many years, but whenever we talked, I never asked him about any problems he had that we could help out with. I feel bad for not taking action,‚Äù he said.

> He understood that the family had financial problems, as the man had told him before that he had been unemployed since his father died, to take care of his mother full time. He previously worked as a warehouse storeman.

> The man was the youngest in his family, and had one elder brother and two sisters. His sisters currently live overseas, and return about once a year to visit.

> The retiree said that over the last 10 years, the man had borrowed money from him less than 10 times, each time for expenses to take his mother for medical check-ups.

> ‚ÄúEach time he would borrow about $50 or $100, but he would always return within around six months,‚Äù he said.

> He added that the man‚Äôs mother had been wheelchair-bound since the start of this year.

> ‚ÄúWe could hear her scolding him everyday, very loudly from morning until at night. But we never understood what she was saying, as she spoke in Tamil.‚Äù

> A 72-year-old resident, who gave his name as Mr Wang, told Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Wanbao that the woman suffered from dementia.

> He added that he last saw the mother-and-son pair on Monday evening, dressed up and heading out of their flat together.

> SINGAPORE - One of the five members of the public involved in subduing a 46-year-old man who allegedly took upskirt videos of a woman has said he never intended to cause his death.

> In an interview with Shin Min Daily News, the man, who declined be named, said he had chased the 46-year-old for about 500m after witnessing him videoing the woman at Little India MRT station.

> He then managed to pin him down along Niven Road with the help of others.

> He told Shin Min he released his grip when the man started vomiting, and added that he did not choke the man to death.

> Police said they were alerted to the incident at 12.45pm on Friday (Nov 1).

> The 46-year-old was already motionless and had no pulse when officers arrived on the scene, police said. He was later pronounced dead by a paramedic.

> In its report published on Sunday (Nov 3), Shin Min reported the man saying he was unable to sleep for two nights after the incident because of the tremendous psychological stress.

> He claimed he was physically smaller compared to the 46-year-old, and that he was pushed aside during the struggle and even sprained his ankle.

> ""We were only carrying out our civic duty, and only wanted to wait for the police to arrive,"" he told Shin Min.

> Related Story Man who allegedly took upskirt videos dies near Little India after being detained by others

> The evening daily reported that another man, who also helped subdue the 46-year-old man, broke down when interviewed by the police.

> Ms Diana Ngiam, an associate director at Quahe Woo & Palmer LLC, told The Straits Times that in such cases, an autopsy is usually done to determine the cause of death.

> If it still remains unclear, a coroner's inquiry could be held, she added.

> ""The Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) will usually decide after the State Coroner has made its findings as to whether to prosecute any of the five involved- if there is evidence that the actions of any of the five are related to the man's death,"" Ms Ngiam said.

> ""In considering whether to prosecute, the AGC will have to consider the intention of the individuals. If it is deemed to be a rash or negligent act, a charge may nonetheless be preferred. However, the full facts will be carefully considered before any decision is made,"" she said.

> Said Mr Amolat Singh of Amolat & Partners: ""(The incident) serves as a lesson to everyone who wants to do a citizen's arrest, where they must be careful to not use excessive force.""

> It will be difficult to determine the exact role played by each individual, he added.

> The case has been classified as an unnatural death and police are investigating.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Sivasarvanan placed a carton of the fireworks on the road at the T-junction of Madras Street and Campbell Lane and lit them before running a distance away.

> The fireworks went off and police officers deployed in Little India for the festive celebrations heard the sound of the fireworks and saw lights shooting up in the sky.

> They rushed to the scene and found the discharged fireworks carton at the scene, but Sivasarvanan was not there.

> A police officer from an observation point at Farrer Park Station Road spotted fireworks in the air around 12.39am.

> It was over in a matter of seconds. But what transpired in those brief moments in Little India on Sunday night left witnesses stunned and bewildered.

> After the driver of a red Ferrari parked his supercar in a service road off Verdun Road around 9pm, a white Audi pulled up in front of it.

> Four men leapt out to confront the Ferrari driver and forced him to kneel before bundling him into their car and speeding away, leaving the Ferrari behind, Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao reported yesterday, quoting witnesses.

> While most were shocked and baffled by what looked like an abduction, a few were alert enough to call the police.

> The witnesses told Wanbao that the Ferrari driver was made to kneel before he was forced to get into the Audi.

> There was no shouting and the incident was over in seconds, they said.

> The police were quick to arrive and cordoned off the alleys near where the Ferrari was parked, the witnesses added.

> A female security guard who was on duty at the time told Wanbao that she was shocked by the incident.

> ""I didn't expect those people to be so brazen and take the man away in full view of the public,"" added the guard, who declined to be identified.

> TOWED AWAY

> Another unnamed witness told Wanbao that the Ferrari was towed away at about 4am the next day.

> The police said yesterday that they had arrested four men, aged between 31 and 33, for their suspected involvement in a case of wrongful confinement in relation to the Little India incident.

> They said in a press release that officers from the Central Police Division and Criminal Investigation Department had established the identities of the suspects through ground inquiries and follow-up investigations before arresting them on Monday.

> Shedding some light on the abduction, they said that preliminary investigations had revealed that the four men are believed to have wrongfully confined the victim to demand the return of a sum of money he had purportedly stolen from one of them in an e-commerce scam.

> Investigations against the four men are ongoing.

> It is not known how the Ferrari driver was released from his alleged wrongful confinement.

> But checks showed that he was charged on Tuesday with one count of cheating.

> The charge sheet names him as Andrew Lim Zi Kai, 29. He was alleged to have cheated a woman of $350 on Carousell after promising a hotel booking package at Marina Bay Sands that was never delivered.

> He has been remanded after he was not offered bail.

> Court records also indicate that investigations against him are ongoing, and he could face nine more similar charges.

> Lim is expected to be back in court on Sept 15 for a further mention of his case.

> If convicted, he can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.

> Those convicted of wrongful confinement can be jailed for up to three years and/or fined.

> Organised by the Little India Shopkeepers and Heritage Association, this year's festival has activities that include decorating of Pongal pots, drawing of kolam using rice flour and chalk, pottery-making workshops and cultural dance performances.

> Tamils who celebrate the festival shop for items such as sugar cane, vegetables and fruits, which are important components of the festival.

> Families also cook pongal, a traditional sweet rice pudding cooked with cow's milk that is served to relatives and friends.

Makara Sankranti or Maghi, is a festival day in the Hindu calendar, dedicated to the deity Surya (sun). It is observed each year in January. It marks the first day of the sun's transit into  Makara (Capricorn), marking the end of the month with the winter solstice and the start of longer days.Makara Sankranti  is one of the few ancient Indian festivals that has been observed according to solar cycles, while most festivals are set by the lunar cycle of the lunisolar Hindu calendar. Being a festival that celebrates the solar cycle, it almost always falls on the same Gregorian date every year (January 14), except in some years when the date shifts by a day for that year.

992,8,fp8nbjo,t1_fp8kvsk,"
The actual reporting is good. The guidelines for purpose built dorms were made in response to the riots. But the standards are clearly not strict enough or not enforced. Forget about facilities. The number of residents per sq ft of sleeping area, the ratio of stoves, toilets, showers and sinks to residents, is it enough?

According to Speak for Climate, The current building code says that ‚ÄúA minimum of 4.5sqm¬†Gross Floor Area¬†of living space per worker shall be provided‚Äù. This minimum standard is 6 times lower than the average living space per Singaporean of 27 sqm.

The current environmental health guidelines for dormitories are 1 water closet, 1 urinal, 1 wash-hand basin, and 1 shower room for every 15 workers. This standard is close to 3 times worse than the International Labour Organisation (ILO)‚Äôs recommendation of a minimum of 1 toilet, 1 wash basin and 1 shower for every 6 persons.

Edit: of course I don't think we should match 27 sqm. But 6 times less is a lot smaller. HDB and URA has maximum occupancy for a residence if occupants do not form a family unit. A 2 room flat has a maximum occupancy of 4 unrelated people and is from 36-45 sq m and has 1 toilet, shower, and 2 sinks, one in the kitchen. 3 room flat and above can fit 6 unrelated people, and for 3 room (60-65 sq m) there are 2 toilets, 2 showers, and 3 sinks. 

The minimum ratio is therefore 9 sq m per person in HDB. Even a family of 10 in a 3 room HDB would be 6 sq m per person, and 1 person better than ILO recommendations.  These are ratios that we can apply.",t3_gbztp2,02-05-2020
993,8,fp96dwx,t1_fp8kvsk,"I feel that your views are quite myopic.

Have you seen how migrant workers are housed and transported? They're treated like  woodpile. Can you imagine the safety and hygiene standards in these dormitories? What about the trucks on which scores of workers are transported without seat belts and harnesses? It's obvious that the lives of these workers *matter less* than your average Singaporean person.

The western media looks at the Middle-east and Singapore with entirely different lenses (for pretty obvious reasons); that is precisely why we've been able to avoid the public eye. The sign of any developed economy is one where *unskilled* labourers (your welders, fitters and electricians) earn a good healthy income. For instance, a lolly-pop man in Australia can earn upto a 120k AUD (factor in a 30-40% tax on that; that's still a take home of about 70-80k); this is why these roles are taken up by Australians (and not folks from South Asia or China). On the flip side, your educated class wouldn't be earning wages that are too dissimilar either. In other words, the income gap is quite narrow and regulated. This is a tell-tale sign of a good, healthy, developed economy; and it's a far cry from what we see here in Singapore.",t3_gbztp2,02-05-2020

1014,8,fp97gdi,t1_fp8phxf,"I edited my post. It's clear that army dorms are not like FW dorms. Let's not talk about camps first, as Tekong dorms, where we are confined for 2 weeks and cannot get a breather by booking out, have to be arranged ro reduce transmission of disease. They are more spacious and have excellent ventilation with windows and ceiling fans at max speed. 

The distancing between and across bunk beds is greater than in the Purpose Built Dormitories. In PBDs, the headboards are placed headboard to headboard. Their head is so close to their neighbours' feet. Even in camps there's greater space between bunks,  and a wardrobe. In PBDs, their barang is on the bed, floor, and s-hook. The cookhouse is also well ventilated. 

Some people may see the pictures and videos of PBDs and somehow believe it is similar to their NS experience. Got camera angle one ok! You think the MSM won't try to make dorms look as spacious as possible? Photos look very artistic also. At home see PBD and army bunks all can seem very nice. There's definitely a difference when you're there.

There is fundamentally a difference between housing in camps and dorms. The number of men in a bunk fluctuates and is getting smaller in general due to decreased manpower in the military from smaller cohorts. Dorm operators are incentivised to keep occupancy at maximum. Even for stay-in, when others book out there's more space. Dorms no book out. And other than the extreme minority with no home outside the camp, we still have a home to look forward to and enjoy. The dorms are their only home.",t3_gbztp2,02-05-2020

1020,8,fp9onqa,t1_fp97gdi,"In my original post, the point was giving them more space per room in a realistic scenario, which should be done by the way, *would not have prevented a dormitory cluster.*

Your point here is army dorm is more livable compared to fw dormitory. I cannot dispute this, you seem to know more details about the condition. I never said my post was infallible. So let's take this as it is. We reduce 1/5 men from every room that's really cramped and expand the dormitory. It's a realistic scenario. Fuck cost cutting. 
We can make it more livable.

Everyone gets more breathable living space.

Would that have changed anything about covid outbreak?

Maybe instead of averaging 1000 we'd get about 800~. Given that they would still share the same eating/cleaning space regardless I wonder how true that would be. I don't have expertise on the exact math of spread to build a model here.

There were no realistic scenario where we are able to give them enough privacy per person to prevent an outbreak. 

TL;DR this isn't exactly the right or wrong conversation for my post. People are mistaken about something, if they want better living conditions for FW, sure. I stand by the point it's not inhumane living condition, but it's also not ideal. 

If they are using covid as an argument for better living conditions, no, it would not have prevented dormitory clusters on the whole.

If you want to push the agenda for better living condition with the argument of minimizing the impact of covid outbreak though, I got nothing, full steam ahead. This was a compromise I left open in my original argument that no one took up because they were too busy trying to pin the entire FW dormitory outbreak on the corporations.

IMO the people who disagreed with my previous post were idealistic pussies who can't come up with a compromise themselves anyway. I have nothing against actual solutions. When you want to submit proposal of any kind in the working world you need concrete research. 

I personally have nothing against wanting better living conditions contrary to what my post might seem like on the first glance. I never stated it's impossible to improve living conditions, nor that there were no negligence. I simply have very tame expectations on what I believe is better living conditions.",t3_gbztp2,02-05-2020
1021,8,fp93m59,t1_fp92ktw,"Ironic that almost everything you said can be used right back at your own comment. There's zero analysis in your comments too and nothing specific to this article either. Your initial comment is nothing but an edgy opinion to maybe try and virtue signal about how woke you are wrt the press freedom in SG. 

Nice strawman btw, imagine picking on the semantics about the middle east death camps. Is that an exaggeration? Yes. But so is the point the article made about the hygiene standard about the ALL the dorms in the SG. My point if you actually bothered the rest of my comment instead of just focusing on the semantics is that it's unfair of the article to lump ALL the dorms together as lacking the proper standards. It is one of the contributing factors for sure but there is definitely a sense of inevitability given how densely packed we are as a nation. 

Again you only choose to see in my comments what you wanna see. I give credit where credit is due in the article nowhere did I imply that it's an us against them type of mentality. In fact you're the only one that seems to be projecting that right now given how defensive you're getting. Is some of the criticism warranted? Yea it is as I've said multiple times but not all of it and the headline and some aspects of the article to me are misleading and definitely pushing an agenda to say the least. And to classify what i'm saying as a ""nationalistic reaction"" is laughable at best, that's some massive projections you're having there buddy.",t3_gbztp2,02-05-2020
1022,8,fpa34bo,t1_fp9onqa,"It's about the attitude the government has towards feedback and the vulnerable. That's what would have prevented this situation. 

The development of PBDs in 2015 were supposed to have reduced the risk and intensity of potential disease transmission. Today we acknowledge that they have become breeding dens for it. Three ministers of manpower from 2015 until now. 

Workers welfare has been an issue raised in the MSM in recent years. Spoiled meals delivered to construction sites and dorms, more expensive prices in dorm supermarkets, panel doctors giving too little MC so employers don't have to be marked for an accident. Inadequate action. 

March. Tourist spots close by themselves, since some tourist spots become clusters. Invisible hand of the market, nothing needs to be done. Construction sites don't close, when a few clusters appeared. 

Healthserve feedbacks that ruling for doctors to only practice at one location to prevent transmission means volunteer doctor numbers are gutted. No exemptions. (This means the govt did recognise that some workers shouldn't be travelling from place to place as they may spread disease. Another type of worker has already been spreading disease by now too. Hmm...) The forum letter on potential dorm vector. No visible action. 

April. Volunteer doctor mentions a sick worker who was able to keep his food down after getting Bengali food in MSM article on the incredible medical translation site that started with Bengali. We're still arguing about food now. Urgent begging for volunteers reveals that not enough staff in MOM, civil service and military know how to speak Bengali. MOM not working with HOME and TWC2. 

If the government had a more open attitude, they would be more transparent about what they have been doing in various sectors to prevent disease. Stakeholders like NGOs would have a back and forth. Assistants would point out pertinent concerns for ministers to address. FWs would know their rights clearly and feel safe reporting violations.

We would have had more healthcare staff in the public system since they weren't being mistreated. Transport services wouldn't have been cut. An information blast on how the enhanced CB was set to stop on 4 may and not June 1 would have been sent when bubble tea and haircut queues started to form. We wouldn't be wondering what a private citizen married to our PM is doing for an unknown salary.

Ok back to residential ratios. The point of a foreign worker levy is to make hiring foreign workers more costly, not exactly to earn tax revenue. If the standards were increased and levies cut, employers don't have to pay more. If it were easier for good, experienced workers to find work instead of having to leave when they lose their job, there wouldn't be a brain drain when the leave for elsewhere or go home and change jobs. We wouldn't be hiring indebted noobs to replace them several months later, reducing productivity. 

And so what if labour costs go up? How much of a contractors and developers costs are labour? How much would tenders have to go up? For BTOs, how much can HDB subsidise, perhaps in a targeted way? How much is the cost to our monthly mortgage? Let's stop with the fear mongering. The civil service should be calculating the forecasted costs like the independent Congressional Budget Office does in the US. 

I'm not well informed. I'm just asking questions, look for pieces of information to answer these questions, and try to make sense of what the situation. So I felt that the emotional dismissal of 'what about NS' needed some unpacking. Was the opinion that NSFs have it worse than FWs based on reality? Is this really a zero sum game? 

To fund this I'll have to talk about reserves, but I've spent too much time on this already. We are unique because we are tax haven that is good to live in. But what if we could become a more attractive place for VHNWIs and above without diluting our tax haven status too much? Do we need to be reinvesting our half of our returns? Do our reserves have to grow above GDP and inflation? How far ahead of every other country do we need to be in order to be satisfied? (Like SIA, it's fine not to be number 1 in some places but like Changi Airport, it's good to be number 1 in others.) Isn't Covid-19 a chance to have some exit from (sudden) sunset industries?
