2,14,Eunos MRT Money Scam,157,m3n0xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/m3n0xz/eunos_mrt_money_scam/,39,13-03-2021,"Today, approx 820pm, a guy approached me and asked me for monetary help. He‚Äôs standing at approx 1.76-78m tall, wearing a The North Face pullover, with some statement necklaces, carrying a backpack, and wearing a black mask.

The purpose of this post is to shoutout to gullible people like me, that scammers are everywhere and may hit u when u least expected it. 

Anyways back to my experience, 

He said he approached some uncle and the uncle told him to shoo, and he felt helpless and he need my help for his medical bills. 

I was skeptical and I did not want to help him AT FIRST. I asked him to bring me to the clinic and he said it‚Äôs far @ marine parade area. Ok, I told him that he can wait for his mom to arrive and take the money from his mom instead of taking mine, and he said his mom will only pick him up late. Sure sure. But I jus felt that if I don‚Äôt help him, who would? I didn‚Äôt even think that he might scam me because he jus sounded so believable, at least to me. 

He claimed that he will pay me by next week as he is meeting some ‚Äòfinancial difficulties‚Äô and told me to leave him my number and he will contact me then. He kept reassuring me that he‚Äôs not out to scam me and he will defo return me the money. He even said to call me this evening to assure me that he‚Äôs ‚Äònot a scammer‚Äô.

And... I gave him the money. It‚Äôs not a small sum to me tbh. In fact it‚Äôs my whole week‚Äôs allowance and it‚Äôs from my grandma. 

Ok but 1 funny thing is that he told me his phone only can do ‚Äòemergency calls‚Äô which I was a little ü§î. He only said this after I sent him the money. 

After I got home, I felt super uneasy. It‚Äôs 12am now, and there‚Äôs no phone call nor text from
him. I tried calling the number but end up it‚Äôs not in use. That is when it struck me hard: I got scammed.

That whole good 10 mins of me getting scammed by him was defo full of struggles. Should I give or should I not? Well, if u read till now, u will know that I gave him the money for his ‚Äòmedical bills‚Äô and I can‚Äôt regret even more.

To the guy who preyed on my sympathy and took my money, if you happen to see this, I hope that you are using that sum of money for something worth it. And, I hope that I‚Äôll be your last victim. 

It‚Äôs because of such people that caused us to not be able to trust those who actually need help. sighs..

UPDATE: today, the ‚Äúscammer‚Äù texted me back to thank me for lending him money using a different number. However, in the text he mentioned he is still very sick and doesn‚Äôt have the means to pay me back. At first, I thought this may not be a scam in the end but on the other hand it‚Äôs very suspicious since he gave me a fake (not in use) number and then texted me using a real one. One possibility could be that he saw this post and decided to text me to make sure I didn‚Äôt report him etc. IDK still gonna report tho...

EDIT: THANK YOU SO MUCH TO EVERYONE WHO COMMENTED FOR ALL THE TIPS AND SUPPORT ü•∫ so heartwarming to see everyone helping each other on this platform (day:made ‚òÄÔ∏è) I will learn from this :‚Äù) ‚ù§Ô∏è"
