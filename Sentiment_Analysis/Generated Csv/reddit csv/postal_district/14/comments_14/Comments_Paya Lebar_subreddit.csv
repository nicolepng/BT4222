But Seletar's 200m walk from cab to gate is similar to the 10- to 15-min jaunt from the DLR station to the gate at LCY, so after the transportation infrastructure around Seletar is beefed up, and the variety of destinations connected to Seletar is beefed up, we could be on to something.",t3_esjj27,23-01-2020

> SINGAPORE - There are seven new coronavirus cases in Singapore, the Ministry of Health announced on Saturday (Feb 8).

> Of these, five are linked to previously announced cases.

> Among the new confirmed cases are a taxi driver and a private hire car driver, it said.

> There is also a possible new cluster comprising five cases, linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar.

> The total number of people infected here has grown to 40.

> Two of the patients have been discharged, but four are now in critical condition and in the intensive care unit, said MOH in its latest update.

> Singapore moved its disease outbreak response up one level to ""orange"" on Friday (Feb 7), after cases surfaced here which could not be traced to the source of infection.

> Under the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon), ""orange"" means the outbreak is deemed to have moderate to high public health impact, though the situation is still under control. It is one step below ""red"", which signifies an out-of-control pandemic.

> Extra measures are in place to reduce mingling in schools, tighten access to hospitals and limit large events.

> After news of the raised outbreak response became public on Friday, items such as rice, instant noodles and toilet paper began flying off the shelves.

> Government leaders have asked shoppers to remain calm.

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Saturday that there are ample supplies.

> ""We are not locking down the city or confining everybody to stay at home,"" he said.

> TGlobally, the situation has escalated, with more than 34,000 people infected and more than 720 deaths. At least 320 patients are outside mainland China.

> The Government has been ramping up its defences against the virus since January, with many of the measures in ""orange"" already in place before the enhanced alert was announced.

> The Dorscon system was set up after the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak. Code orange was imposed during the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009.

> Currently, the Health Ministry does contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the confirmed cases.

> It is a labour-intensive task, with seven teams of 10 people working in two shifts from 8.30 am till 10 pm, seven days a week, calling people to check if they are ""close contacts"" of coronavirus patients.

> But if the numbers keep growing, and the virus becomes widespread, it will at some point be futile to try to trace every contact.

> If the authorities still hospitalise and isolate every suspect case, hospitals will be overwhelmed, said PM Lee on Saturday.

> ""At that point, provided that the fatality rate stays low like flu, we should shift our approach,"" he said.

> This would include encouraging those with only mild symptoms to see their family doctor and rest at home instead of going to the hospital, and letting hospitals and healthcare workers focus on the most vulnerable patients - the elderly, young children, and those with medical complications.

for me my family was infected by coughing taxi driver (couhging every 3 seconds), who dont wear a mask. within a week all 3 of us start coughing and getting sick. probably flu. if you guys dont want to get sick and your driver is coughing just exit the vehicle or inmmediately wind down the windows dont be afraid to offend the driver",t3_f0st2z,08-02-2020

Looks like the travel ban came too late. We should have realised that airport screening and contact tracing was insufficient and acted on it faster, rather than assuming this virus could be contained in a similar manner to SARS.

What?!? I mean, I get the genuine concern that we cannot isolate every mild case in the isolation wards if the cases continue to rise, but, we are now not even trying to enforce some sort of quarantine on them?

Its mild for most of the people, sure. But what if these carriers spread to those vulnerable in the community? Are Singaporeans even responsible enough to not spread any germs indiscriminately? I have met someone who *coughed at me* just days ago (can’t even be bothered to cover or aim it elsewhere). World class behaviour, man.

Oh, don’t even get me started on those working in F&B that *couldn’t even wash their hands after using the toilet*, and we expect them to care about hygeine now?

This thing spreads damn fast. Look at how we sabo’ed France, Malaysia, Britain, Korea, all thanks to *one* dude from Wuhan showing up in a conference.

Now we are risking it to get ourselves overwhelmed, but then this time, it will be all the serious ones, since we gave up trying to stop it from spreading freely by treating it as flu...

Never trust people to keep bad things to themselves. Who knows who might have gotten that brain-eating new virus (making people stupid) running around these days.

In China, the fatality rate is 1.8%. **Outside China it's only 0.2%.** This figure might drop lower as initial cases tends to be more severe. And those who died usually have some other prevailing conditions as well, that's why the elderly are most vulnerable.

Also, the fatality rate for SARS was 10%. MERS is 30%. Seasonal flu 1%.

> Speaking to reporters during a visit to the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) Command Centre, Mr Shanmugam said that the process of contact tracing involves ""a lot of careful investigative work"".

> ""It is a very important task. When you have someone who is diagnosed as having the illness, you want to be able to trace back to all the people he or she met, both in terms of who he or she could have got it from, and also who he or she may have passed it on to.

> ""And you have to identify the type of contact. It’s got to be close contact,"" he explained.

> 

> ""It requires interviewing the individual and then a lot of careful investigative work, such as tracking the person’s movements over a period of time. You can imagine that in a place like Singapore with its frequency of movement and the frequency of contacts - a case in any city - that this is not an easy task. So they are doing it very intensely.""

> On Monday, Singapore reported two more confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, one of whom is a Certis Cisco employee who had served quarantine orders on two people from Wuhan. The other patient is a two-year-old girl who was among the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30.

> 

> There have now been 45 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Singapore. Seven have been discharged from hospital and seven are in critical condition.

> 

> ""In some ways, these are the kind of things they do in the context of normal investigations. The purpose, of course, is different. The intensity, the speed and the amount of work may also be different,"" said Mr Shanmugam of the contact tracing team, which consists of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau, the CID and land divisions.

> 

> ""In the context of the investigation of a crime, it’s very focused. But here you are talking about all contacts the person may have had and then narrowing it down,"" he added.

> 

> ""MOH will do the first cut in terms of interviewing the patient and identifying some data and then passes this over, and these officers then run through the whole investigative process.""

> 

> UNCOVERING A POSSIBLE CLUSTER

> 

> Five cases have been linked to a possible cluster at The Life Church and Missions, which is located at 146B Paya Lebar Road.

> 

> This includes a married couple from Wuhan (cases 8 and 9) as well as three Singaporeans (cases 31, 33 and 38) who had visited the church.

> 

> While cases 31 and 33, which were first announced on Feb 7, initially appeared as unlinked local transmission cases, the police later discovered that both patients had attended the same church, on the same day (Jan 19) at around the same time.

> 

> As services conducted in Mandarin were available at the church, police surmised there were links to cases reported earlier. They studied this possibility and found that four previous patients had arrived in Singapore on or before Jan 19.

> 

> After reaching out to these individuals for further information, it was found that cases 8 and 9 had arrived in Singapore in the early hours of Jan 19 and had gone to church that morning.

> 

> The contact tracing team managed to establish these links within a day.

> 

> ""Some of the officers who were doing this (tracing) noticed that some of those in Singapore had gone to a certain church in Macpherson, The Life Church and Missions Singapore,"" said Mr Shanmugam.

> 

> ""The two cases, 8 and 9, also had been to that church and so they dug in more. The key thing here was to first identify carefully and track the movements, step by step and then pick out the similarities. It is a lot of painstaking work, as you can imagine, because these are movements over several days to different places,"" he added.

> 

> ""Tracking each one's movements and then comparing against the movements of others and identifying the commonalities... They did very well there.

> They are trying to do similar sort of work for the other cases,"" said Mr Shanmugam.

What is actually happening is this:

1. Pedestrian sees red light and stops before crossing.

2. Pedestrian's mind wanders or is engaged in some other activity.

3. Pedestrian hears car engines starting and thinks that the light is now green and attempts to cross.

Step 3 is a correct assumption if and only if the light was red while the light was already green in the perpendicular direction - hence the sound of the car engines starting would be from the cars going in the same direction as the crossing.

However, if the light had just turned red after being green, the sound of the car engines starting would actually be from those in the perpendicular direction as you see in this case. I have witnessed this many times and personally have been susceptible to this instinct as well. Most of the time the pedestrian has an urge to cross but notices that actually the light is still red and traffic is incoming, so they stop their attempt to cross. But if the pedestrian does not pay attention and continues the attempt, then we get the disaster depicted in this scenario.

There is a cross junction that I use on my daily commute equipped with a system that can dynamically vary the signal pattern depending on demand. In one of the directions that I traverse that junction going straight, the green light for straight-moving traffic comes on together with the right turning green arrow. Both will then turn amber and then red together. What I've noticed in the mornings (\~6.30am) is that, at this point, if there are still cars waiting to turn right, the right turning arrow will turn green again in both directions. But if the right turning lane is empty, then the second green arrow is skipped and cross traffic will get the green lights right away.

You can see where this is going. Once in a while there will be some idiot from the perpendicular roads who didn't expect the second right turning arrow, and just moves off on red.

A system that was designed to make the junction safer (removal of discretionary right turns) and more efficient (dynamically varying the signal pattern) may have inadvertently made it more dangerous because people ~~are too used to simple and predictable~~ won't just fucking look at the lights one last time before going

p.s. Some other relevant bits:

 **49.**  A good driver automatically reduces his speed when... (*e*)approaching a bend, brow of a hill, or any other obstruction that limits his view. 

 **83.**  When driving (especially on any road without a path beside it) ...

However, for people who are crossing green man which then turn red, they tend to run finish the remaining.

In this case, the behavior is liken to the latter. Therefore, it is good to assume they don't even know they are crossing red. Therefore, it also good to assume both of them are in their own world and only suddenly aware of the red man. However, since they don't know is red in the beginning, they adapt the latter behavior.

The HC itself contains a preamble disclaiming that it is explicitly constitutes traffic law and functions more like a code of conduct.

A Court in assessing whether there's been a breach of standards in a driver will definitely refer to the HC, but this will likely still be assessed against the backdrop of general negligence law for motorists and the particular case facts.

My view is that these HC paras are themselves insufficient to import a legal obligation on motorists.",t3_j3mrzk,02-10-2020
471,14,g7dpysb,t1_g7dog2o,"If the lights are in your favour, you are expected to slow down by taking your foot off the pedal when you are at the first arrow. If you're travelling at 50km/h, the speed limit unless otherwise stated, you should slow down to about 40 km/h by the time you reach the second arrow. The second arrow is where you commit to your action, either you start to slow down if the light is yellow or red or if it's green, maintain your speed by putting some pressure on the pedal.

Considering that the traffic in the opposite direction was moving off, there was no reasonable reason to expect anyone to be still crossing the road. The common sense reaction would have been to stop on the island in the middle, not make a fucking dash to the other side when the lights are green.

Even if the driver started braking before the lights in order to slow down, how much should have he have braked to slow down and to what speed and when? He has to take into consideration the speed that the cars behind are travelling at as well.",t3_j3mrzk,02-10-2020

After quick googling, I managed to locate the case I vaguely recall seeing before. I believe the point here is that the judges are not prepared to go so far to hold that the applicable standard of care for motorists requires a strict legal obligation to slow down at junctions with lights in their favour: 

[Thorben Langvad v Leong Mei Kuen](https://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/docs/default-source/module-document/judgement/2012-sgca-61.pdf) at para 51 to 55 (citing an older Singapore case which in turn cites an old English case) but more specifically at para 51(100,109)

>100    What counsel for the defendant was arguing for was, in effect, a blanket rule to the effect that all drivers were under a legal duty to slow down when approaching a traffic junction, regardless of the circumstances concerned and even where the traffic lights were in their favour. *This would be most impractical and inefficient where there is otherwise no reasonable apprehension of danger.* To reiterate the wise counsel of Lord Dunedin (above at \[97\]), ‘people must guard against reasonable probabilities, but they are not bound to guard against fantastic possibilities’. ***Everything does ultimately, therefore, depend on the specific facts*** (see also *Charlesworth & Percy on Negligence* (Sweet & Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2001) at para 9-193); and it is from this interactive relationship between the law and the facts that a fair and just result emerges.  
>  
>…  
>  
>109     *There can, in my view, be no blanket rule one way or the other.* ***In my view, the only clear guiding principle is the broad one stated earlier to the effect that, in the absence of clear and compelling circumstances to the contrary, there is no legal duty on a driver to slow down automatically each time he or she approaches a traffic junction if there is no stop sign or where the traffic lights are in his or her favour.***

&#x200B;

>IS there any good reasons to generally not require drivers to slow down before traffic lights?

I would characterise this as more like the reasons the courts have not seen fit to import a specific legal duty on drivers to do such a thing, rather than whether it is objectively good practice for drivers to slow down before junctions (which nobody would seriously disagree with). 

As for the reasons, I guess the judges have articulated their rationale in the paras cited above better than I ever can.",t3_j3mrzk,02-10-2020
484,14,g7dul95,t1_g7dsbep,"There is nothing reasonable about looking at an accident where the car stops three vehicle lengths after the point of impact, and saying it's possible it was speeding at the time. It's clearly not going that fast anywhere on these recordings, and speculation about what was happening outside the video is fiction writing.

Lemme ask you this though, as a fellow driver. You must be aware how often motorcyclists and pedestrians break the road rules. Have you noticed how many times this sub tries to come up with garbage reasons why accidents caused by other people are somehow the car's fault? It's really quite the thing.",t3_j3mrzk,02-10-2020

I am not sure how far this judgment goes though. As far as I can tell, the ""fantastical possibility"" in that case was a vehicle cutting a red light and driving across on coming traffic. I think yes that would qualify as one of the ""blatant"" breaches of traffic rules. 

Jay walking however, as matter of fact, is something that unfortunately happens everyday, and I don't think a court will accept that drivers need not slow down where a driver would reasonably anticipate jay walkers. Yes, in one view this is unfair to the driver, but there is obvious public policy of protecting pedestrians (from their own stupidity) since a car hitting a pedestrian is more deadly than a car hitting another car.",t3_j3mrzk,02-10-2020

It's the thing because that's what the law expects of drivers. You might think it's unfair, and you are entitled to that opinion, but the hard truth here is that the law favors pedestrians over drivers. You can literally find it in  the Highway Code that drivers of cars need to pay attention to pedestrians regardless of whether the pedestrians are entitled to be on the road. 

> **83.**  When driving (especially on any road without a path beside it) —(*a*)watch out for pedestrians, pedal cyclists, riders of power‑assisted bicycles or personal mobility devices, and drivers of mobility scooters or motorised wheelchairs, regardless of whether they are allowed on the road; 

The reason behind this, I think, is obvious. If a collision occurs the pedestrian is likely to be seriously injured. So unfortunately the law expects drivers to take greater care against pedestrians even if the pedestrians aren't supposed to be on the road.",t3_j3mrzk,02-10-2020

Yeah for what its worth I don't think the driver here will escape with nothing.

This is essentially the principle of causative potency which focuses on the degree of disparity in potential harms that a negligent party can cause to the other and vice versa.

> ""We only learnt about their link with the church through official government reports,"" said a spokesman in response to queries from The Straits Times.

> Of the other three, one of them did not attend a cell group. The other two belonged to different cell groups, said the church spokesman.

> This includes one of the seven cases announced by the Health Ministry (MOH) on Saturday - a woman, 52, who had visited the church. MOH had said epidemiological investigations and contact tracing uncovered links with four earlier patients, making the church a possible new cluster of five cases (Cases No 8, 9, 31, 33 and 38).

> The church spokesman identified Cases No 8 and 9 as the foreigners who had visited the church on their own.

> The Health Ministry had earlier said the two cases were a couple, both 56, who are both Chinese nationals from Wuhan. They arrived together in Singapore on Jan 19.

> Cases No 31, 33 and 38 are Singaporeans. They include:

> - a man, 53, living at Tampines Street 24 who had gone to Malaysia on 6, 11 and 17 January

> - a woman, 39, who was in Malaysia from 22 to 29 January, and

> - a woman, 52, living at Choa Chu Kang Avenue 3.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Get latest updates

> On Sunday (Feb 9), the church told The Straits Times that it has decided to stop cell group meetings and home gatherings to minimise the spread of the virus, the church spokesman said.

> This is on top of earlier precautions it had taken, such as engaging a professional cleaning company to disinfect its premises. It had also announced that it will be stopping all physical meetings and services in the church for at least two weeks since Friday (Feb 7).

> Its Sunday service had been live-streamed on YouTube instead.

> The spokesman said that the church reopens, it will abide by advisories issued by the Health Ministry, and perform temperature screenings to look out for worshippers who may be feeling unwell.

> ""We will also prepare masks for those who have the need for them,"" said the spokesman in an e-mail.

> During the service on Sunday, the church's pastor Reverend Vincent Choo cautioned congregants against xenophobia, urging them to continue praying for Singapore, China and medical staff at the frontlines of the battle against the ongoing outbreak.

> Speaking in Mandarin during the service, which was live-streamed from about 10.30am, he told congregants it was understandable if they were alarmed by news that the church had been identified as a potential new cluster.

> But he said the outbreak was not the fault of any particular group of people.

> Instead, people should continue praying for medical staff, Singapore, as well as those living in ground zero in China.

> In his sermon, Reverend Choo had warned the congregation that they may be shunned following news that the church had been identified as a possible infection cluster, and asked for their understanding.

> The church spokesman later told The Straits Times that there has to be mutual understanding.

> ""Those who are being shunned have to understand it is normal human reaction to be concerned and worried, and thus not take the perceived rejection too much to heart,"" said the spokesman.

> ""On the other hand, while the fear is real, we also need to be objective and aware that since the symptoms of this virus is similar to common flu, we should try not to over-react when someone display certain symptoms.""

> Still, it was important for all to exercise social responsibility to prevent the spread of the virus, and to wear masks when necessary.

> Added the spokesman: ""The values of Christianity include that of love, service and acceptance, these are the virtues which are much needed during times like this.""

> SINGAPORE — A 20-year-old man was charged in court on Tuesday (Aug 6) for flying a drone recreationally without a valid permit.

> Court documents showed that Homen Wong allegedly flew the drone in the afternoon of Feb 8 last year, at the open field next to Sengkang LRT Station.

> The field is situated within five kilometres of two aerodromes — Seletar Airport and Paya Lebar Air Base. 

> Wong is accused of operating a 0.74kg DJI Mavic Pro unmanned aircraft without a Class 2 activity permit.

> Wong told the court that he intends to plead guilty to the charge, and he will return to court on Sept 3.

> If convicted under the Air Navigation Order, he could be fined up to S$20,000. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to 15 months, or fined up to S$40,000, or both.

> Last month, two men became the first individuals prosecuted here for flying drones without a permit near an airbase.

> Ed Chen Junyuan, 37, and Tay Miow Seng, 40, were charged in court on July 5 for allegedly flying drones recreationally at an open field in Punggol, which is within 5km of the Paya Lebar Air Base. Their case is still pending.

> So far, only a construction firm has been dealt with in court for a similar offence.

> The Singapore arm of LT Sambo, a civil engineering company that primarily deals with bridge, tunnel, viaduct and elevated highway construction, was fined S$9,000 last month for flying a DJI Phantom drone along Marine Parade Road in 2017 for business purposes without a permit.

> The company had been carrying out underground foundation works for an MRT development project, and wanted to capture aerial footage of the vicinity for its construction work plan.

They should deregulate at least for the beginner level drones because those drones can't fly above like 50-100m then incrementally work around with the law.
