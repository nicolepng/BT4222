As what Pritam says, online sentiments don't translate into votes, but at least we can do something about it by sharing the importance of not going backwards and losing ALJUNIED.",474,hnjev0,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hnjev0/if_you_have_aljunied_friends_who_are_fence/,39,08-07-2020,"Firstly, the transmission personal political views to another individual is allowed on cooling off day. [Source. ](https://www.eld.gov.sg/candidate_parliamentary_cooling.html). 

Tbh I'm not very confident of WP keeping Aljunied (let's not even talk about Sengkang). 

Once Aljunied GRC is lost, its highly probable the counsitency disappear like Anson, Punggol East, Cheng San, Eunos etc and gerrymandering will take place. Its going to be another few GE before we see more opposition MPs if this happens. 

If your friends are worried we might accidentally wipe out PAP, tell them that's never going to happen. When the electorate was openly unhappy with the PAP in 2011, they still won 81 out of 87 of the seats despite only getting only 60% of the votes. 

If they are worried that their town won't get upgrades for the next five years, tell them that THAT'S FAKE NEWS. AHTC towns still receive lift upgrades, new playgrounds, new amenities, parks, fresh coat of paints and national upgrading programs like HIP. The fear mongering PAP started decades ago on lack of upgrades is fake news. If they don't believe, direct them to Aljunied GRC Facebook or AHTC [newsletter](https://www.ahtc.sg/links/2020/06/Special-Newsletter-2020-PDF-for-website.pdf). 

And finally, the main perks of having WP MPs is you have TWO MPs serving you. The PAP Grassroots advisors will be around sharing fried chicken and bird nest. You will be the centre of attention of both WP and PAP who will ensure you needs are taken care of because they know the importance of Aljunied voters. 

I really hope that WP retains Aljunied and instead of sitting here doing nothing, let's try to at least convince the fence sitters?"

We knew that opposition wards were punished for their votes, but this was the first smoking gun I saw. From people around me, I knew that last 10 years, Aljunied-Hougang's rubbish disposable services, playgrounds, parks, and lifts were lowered in quality. Rubbish piled up and they were slow to clear. Playgrounds were rebuilt with fewer structures and games. Parks were ""renovated"" but looked worse than before. Lifts were replaced with a noisy and unreliable Sigma brand. Some of these may not be related to Town Council funding but I am unsure. 

Someone else in the know may enlighten us?
