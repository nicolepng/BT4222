Visited Tiong Bahru Market today to see how the stallholders are doing. I wanted to reassure them of the government’s support, and shared with them the measures we have put in place to help safeguard their livelihoods and well-being amidst the COVID-19 situation. 

One of the new measures we are introducing, to protect both stallholders and patrons, is to require ALL food/drinks handlers at F&B establishments to wear masks or other forms of physical barriers such as face shields. This includes personnel at restaurants, caterers, supermarkets, food courts, coffee shops as well as those in our hawker centres and markets.  
 
From Monday, 13 April, our Enforcement Officers (EOs) and Safe Distancing Ambassadors will ensure F&B employees meet this new requirement, and take enforcement action  such as fines, prosecution and licence suspension against non-compliant establishments. This requirement  will remain beyond the COVID-19 crisis as it is a good practice not just to safeguard public health but also to prevent food contamination. EOs will also continue to remind all F&B employees to stay home if they are unwell. 
 
I have previously shared on how we are helping stallholders with their rental, table-cleaning and central dishwashing fees: (removed the Facebook link)
 
This is a tough time for all our stallholders but with the COVID-19 situation swiftly evolving, it is more important than ever that we upkeep cleanliness and public hygiene. Although we cannot dine in at eating places during this period, do continue to lend your support to our hawker centres and the F&B sector  - patronise their stalls by ordering takeout (bring your own clean containers! ♻️) or delivery. 

We are into our 5th day of circuit-breaker measures, and our actions now will determine whether Singapore successfully contains the outbreak. Do remember to stay home except to go out for essential goods and services. And to keep a safe distance of at least one metre away from the next person when you are out. 

Stay home, and stay safe.

 
今天走访中峇鲁巴刹了解小贩们的情况，并向他们解释政府为了帮助他们维持生计，所给予的支持和措施。

加强清洁卫生是对抗疫情的关键。为了保护摊贩和食客的安全，我们将规定所有在餐饮场所售卖和准备食物或饮料的员工，必须佩戴口罩或面罩。这包括餐馆、餐饮外包服务、超市、食阁、咖啡店，还有所有小贩中心和巴刹的摊贩。这将是长久性的规定，帮助提高卫生标准并确保食物安全。国家环境局正为所有小贩分发可重复使用的口罩。
从4月13日起，我们的执法人员和安全距离大使将确保餐饮业员工遵守这项新规定，并对违规者采取执法行动。执法人员也会继续提醒所有餐饮业员工，若身体不适务必留在家中，不可处理食物。

虽然我们暂时无法在外用餐，但我鼓励大家继续通过打包或外送服务支持我们的小贩中心和餐饮业。打包时请记得自行携带清洁的容器，为环保尽一份力♻️！

新加坡现已进入第五天的阻断措施 -- 我们每个人在日常生活中的行为将决定是否成功遏制疫情。

在此提醒大家： 除非有必要出外购买食物或必需品，不然请待在家中。外出时，与他人保持至少一米的安全距离。

让我们共同努力，对抗疫情。
