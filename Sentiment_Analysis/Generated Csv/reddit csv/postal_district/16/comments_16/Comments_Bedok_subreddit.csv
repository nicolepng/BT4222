Einstein asked Sir Manasseh for his support to establish a Jewish University to ensure the general and science education for the Jewish people throughout the world.

oh man /r/singapore is going to get triggered so hard.


i mean this is not too different from what Kuan Yew said:

>I have said this on many a previous occasion: that had the mix in Singapore been different, had it been 75% Indians, 15% Malays and the rest Chinese, it would not have worked. Because they believe in the politics of contention, of opposition. But because the culture was such that the populace sought a practical way out of their difficulties, therefore it has worked.

another one:
>throughout East Asia, because they were influenced by China and probably not just by culture alone, there must have been a lot of similar genes, similar stock, probably the physical makeup was not very different, so they were very intense types, hard-driving, hard- striving people. Whereas if you go to India, you‚Äôll find sadhus, holy men, people who abjure the world, who go around giving land away or begging from the rich to give to the poor. It‚Äôs a totally different culture. There‚Äôs the sort of Gandhi saintliness. It‚Äôs not the model in China. In China, the model is either Three Kingdoms or Shui Hu Zhuan, Water Margin, the kind of hero who forms a robber band and kills off wealthy people. You don‚Äôt go begging from the wealthy to give to the poor. You just kill the wealthy and take from them.

>So it is a completely different philosophy to guide a man in life. The Indians have a more tolerant and forgiving approach to life. More next-worldly. If you do good, then in the next world you‚Äôll get rewarded.

You state the above but Indian culture does value being curious and accquring knowledge for the sake of gaining knowledge. Chinese culture doesn't value knowledge unless it's profitable. Isn't there a popular Chinese concept of not getting involved, unless there's profit in it for oneself?

yes but Einstein, more than ever after the rise of the Nazis and the holocaust, held on even more strongly to his Jewish identity, and not the religious part, but the tribal part.

and before that dark period of history, he also said things like 'the deterioration of the human race is surely a bad thing, one of the worst possible things'. This was in the context of him opposing his son, Hans Albert, marriage to Frieda Knecht, whom he considered genetically inferior (too short).

Even after the war, for his other son Eduard, he would always attribute the cause of Eduard's psychological troubles to biology - specifically, from Eduard's mother, his wife Maric.

450,16,g0jta40,t3_i4pzig,"Note that this is a FEMALE honeycomb ray, a large and slow-growing species that gives birth to only a few young at one time. These factors, in addition to its reliance on shallow waters such as esturaries as nurseries, contribute to its extreme vulnerability. Such a large ray is most likely sexually mature and killing it has untold reprecussions on the ray population here. 


I doubt the uncle is really at fault here unless you can prove he deliberately targeted large rays instead of the usual sambal stingray one (I believe that is the mangrove whipray?). However this might be a sign that regulations on angling (similar to those in California, where leopard sharks and dungeness crabs within a certain size range must be thrown back) should be a thing. 


Still, I'm doubtful how effective that will be without Fish And Game rangers (imagine someone gets violent with a poor overworked NParks staff? at least assaulting a game warden in USA is a felony) to police. Also given the huge marine biodiversity here, drawing up a list of vulnerable species would be quite onerous, especially since it's not just fish but stuff like sea cucumber, mud crabs, etc getting poached. And a lot of anglers do the environment a service by targeting exotic species that aren't native, such as peacock bass or zebra mussels.

A good place to start would be regulations on cartilaginous fishes like sharks and rays, due to their reproductive rates (protect a few offspring in the womb as opposed to carpet bombing the area with eggs and leaving like most other fish) they are more vulnerable to fishing. I've seen photos floating around of blacktip reef shark pups being left to die at St John's Island by fishermen just looking for a ""fight"". The bigger problem is of course the fishing trawlers at Senoko and Jurong.

> An 80kg giant stingray was caught at Bedok Jetty on July 30.

> The angler, Alo, recounted his epic catch on his Shoreangler blog.

> He said it took over three hours to reel the creature in.

> After he did, the spoils of their catch was distributed to those on shore.

> Alo wrote on the blog: ""We had to cut up the fish and weigh it part by part to get the actual weight of the fish. Final weight add up to 80kg. The fish was shared among many friends.""

> ""This fish could be the second heaviest that have caught at bedok jetty since it open in 1974.""

> Slammed by public

> Subsequently, a member of the public took to Facebook to slam the act of killing the stingray instead of letting it go free.

> The woman, Samantha Lee, shared photos showing the bloodied stingray, identified as a leopard whipray.

> The leopard whipray is classified as a vulnerable and threatened species under the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

> Videos of the stingray being cut up was also put up with the Facebook post.

> Lee slammed those involved for inflicting on the stingray unnecessary suffering and killing it, as the creature likely died a terrible death.

> She wrote: ""Keeping in mind that this is a 80kg to 100kg Ray and slimy, it's not going to be an easy task. There was no way they could have brought this Ray up onto the jetty without a net.""

> ""So, Alo and the people around him had to USE VARIOUS TOOLS to POKE, STAB, HOOK, STRING the Ray up onto the jetty.""

> ""And because of this action, the Ray probably bled out on the jetty AND DIED. YES THE RAY DIED. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL, the Ray was then cut up and shared among the people there.""

> ACRES response

> In response to Mothership's queries, Kalai Vanan, deputy chief executive officer of the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES) said:

> We feel frustrated and sad that the leopard whipray, a vulnerable species according to CITES was killed instead of being freed. This species, like countless other aquatic animals regardless of their population status have seen substantial decline in populations due to overfishing. It is sad that the animal had to be killed even though food security in Singapore is secure. While ACRES as an animal welfare group recognises fish as sentient beings too, this issue can be better managed by more awareness raising among the angling community on what they can take and what they should release back. Perhaps signs at popular fishing spots on possible endangered species they may encounter may help anglers make better informed decisions. We may be lacking in clear blue waters but let us remember that the waters around our tiny island are home to some amazing biodiversity including species of sharks, dolphins, stingrays and sea turtles. We should be working towards preserving them and treating animals with compassion.

457,16,g0mb20r,t3_i4pzig,"I'm not against new laws and licenses for fishermen, if anything, I'm for it. But as an angler myself, it was clear that Samantha Lee was not an angler and exaggerated her report. Typically, to my knowledge, most anglers fishing for larger fish at bedok jetty will use bait (dead or live), this means that 9/10 times the hook is swallowed and hooks onto a fish's gills, thus causing it to bleed out and die. That's why those who plan to catch and release typically use artificial lures as they usually only hook the tip of a fish's mouth. 

Given the situation of catching the stingray, as mentioned, it was impossible to use a net. Anglers use  a ""gaff"" which is a large hook tied to a rope to hook and lift the creature up. (Not exactly sure if this was done but I'd imagine that's what happened)

So take note, it was not impossible that the ray would have already died BEFORE it was lifted up. Samantha Lee's report exaggerated this part, which was untrue and unnecessary. 

If we give her the benefit of doubt, say the ray was still alive and well. Keeping the hook and cutting off the line is not an option as it will still eventually damage the ray's innards/intestines and kill it eventually. Whether the man was aware it was an endangered species, up to debate. 
 
My point is, as an angler, your first reaction when you catch the ray is NOT to eat it, it looks nothing like your hawker bbq rays. When you catch a fish, you do NOT cut the line to release it unless the line breaks on its own. 

The only part I felt was slightly off was the distribution of the meat. Perhaps the relevant agencies could've been contacted before cutting up the creature. But from the perspective of an older folk, perhaps this was not what came to mind.

Education is the best and most effective way to reduce the chances of such incidents. Back then education on such topics was not as advanced or informative as it probably is now. It is unfair to slam the old folk who caught this, it is probably more meaningful to focus on educating our youths and the next generation.",t3_i4pzig,06-08-2020
458,16,g0oeh6p,t3_i4pzig,"What does Samantha Lee mean by poking and stabbing the ray though? They just used gaffs to hook the gills and mouth area. Usually at Bedok jetty we have to land larger fish with gaffs anyway. Also, a net, regardless of how large, might not be suitable for a stingray which might thrash about within it. The best we can hope for is that we get fishing licenses or a branch of NEA to specialise in protecting endangered species and enforcing size limits (as an angler I know a lot of people who tabao juvenile fish unreasonably).

you can still farm domesticated animals like chickens and pigs sustainably, just not in the massive excesses of factory farming with unchecked use of antibiotics and growth hormones and corn feed. there is no way in hell for you to farm a tuna or a whipray, these are macropredators. are you saying we have no right to condemn trophy hunters because no one lives up to your standards of ideological purity? because sport fishing for sharks and rays is basically the same thing as shooting Cecil the Lion, but underwater. 


your arguments are tired and lacking in scientific rigour. of course eating meat is bad. but restricting the depletion of a critically endangered wild fish is somewhat easier than toppling the multi-billion dollar meat industry, which a few individual vegans can never accomplish in their wildest dreams. even indigenous Brazilians literally taking up ak-47s and shooting ranchers bulldozing the Amazon can't stop them. do you expect everyone to go to that extent?

> SINGAPORE - A 65-year-old woman who was seriously injured in an e-scooter accident last Saturday in Bedok died in hospital on Wednesday (Sept 25).

> Police confirmed Madam Ong Bee Eng had died. A 20-year-old man was arrested after the accident, and police said they are investigating the case as one of causing death by a rash act.

> Madam Ong, a logistics assistant packer, had been in a coma at Changi General Hospital's (CGH) Surgical Intensive Care Unit since she collided with the e-scooter while riding her bicycle.

> She suffered a serious brain injury as well as fractures in her ribs and collar bone. Her family was told to prepare for the worst on Monday, after her blood pressure dropped.

> Friends and family described Madam Ong, a widow with two children and two grandchildren, as a helpful and well-respected woman.

> Last Saturday, she visited her 88-year-old mother at the Singapore General Hospital, attended a wake, and had dinner at a coffee shop in Kaki Bukit before stopping at a supermarket to buy a few things.

> She was on her way home, taking her usual route, when the accident occurred, her younger brother, Andy Ong, 53, had earlier told The Straits Times.

> ""She has been cycling in the area for almost 30 years, and has never had an accident before,"" he had said, referring to Madam Ong as dajie, or big sister. ""I'm going to lose a sister, such a wonderful sister.""

> He said she was a generous and caring person. If she was buying groceries home, she would frequently text him to check if he needed anything, as the two live only a block apart in Chai Chee Street.

> Her colleagues cried after seeing her in the ward, said Mr Ong.

> ""She is very well-respected by them, and treats some of them like her children,"" he added. ""Wherever she goes, she makes friends with everyone.""

This kind of behavior is endemic in Singapore to the point that, embarrassingly, we have to have public signs telling people how to behave and be courteous.

Secondly, we don't have to PTSD over whether we exceed 10km/h or not. Because let's face it, if every delivery riders abide 100% to this, your food will be cold even before it got to your hands.

Now I'm not saying that this will solve all the problems or it's easier said than done. It's not. But this is really better than downright banning it. Don't simply use your emotions to mask yourselves from making a rational and logical decision, because a lot of people like me who are gracious on the walkways and depend on Food delivery for their rice bowls will suffer.

After it was done there was no complaints and things were working fine on our end. 

Jump to more than 2 years later, the same tenants came up to tell us that they have the same water leakage problem. But the twist was that whatever the contractor did, didn't actually solve their problem. The leakage didn't stop and went on for more than 2 years. When I went to see their toilet, they had what looked like crystallised water. I wondered how they tolerated that.

I'm in construction sector and hv seen some bad water leakage issues in older condos. Water seepage issues are definitely pain in the ass and usually almost impossible to solve. You could try to trace it but you will never be certain. Solving the problem area may lead to more water seepage into other fault areas. 


As for the aircon near bathroom thing. There's one client of mine who actually has their a/c turn on most of the day. The master toilet doesn't have a door (only a curtain). So their downstairs neighbor complain to hdb and client got us (their contractor) to handle it.

789,16,fx7shd7,t1_fx7maso,"For her case she seems to be sure that its the mixing of clean with waste water, so scoping or smoking the sanitary / drain pipes should be a good way to find out the problem. 

I agree water leaks from ceilings and walls are a whole different ball game but with time and persistence, + the proper tools and methods(either sonar or dye testing), there's a very good chance u can find out where's the leak coming from, but unfortunately if your problem is really minor, not many will use such methods. 

So most of the time the solution is to do spot patching, paint over and pray the water dont travel elsewhere and leak out from a new area (spoiler: they will always manage to lol)

As for the last issue on condensation due to temperature variance between upper and lower units, I'm not really experienced in this so no comments. Tho I hear it's more to do with the quality of the concrete used (poor insulation?) more than anything.

Demographically, yes there can be differences. For example, people that live in Jurong GRC probably have a lower median income than say Tangjong Pagar GRC. That can affect voter preferences, and so can many other factors.

Here in Singapore, there is barely any high quality polling that account for details like gender, ethnicity, income, ideological stance, etc. But many other countries do, and you can read about them to see how demographics can affect voting preferences.

It did not made sense to me cos that part of Lorong 8 was across Bishan and in TPY and how can it be nearer to Potong Pasir!?!? And the other half of TPY Lor 8 was under Bishan-TPY GRC/Town Council. I always felt like laughing.

Thats not all

So I moved out of TPY and got a SOBF near to the Gurkha camps. At that time, HDB labelled my area and all the Bidadari area (Its a BIG project but the plot they were building that time was nearer to Potong Pasir) flats as TOA PAYOH. I thought it was pure BS. Cos we were obviously nearer to PP and Serangoon than TPY!!!

No prices for guessing why they labelled it this way..cos well, they probably wanted to charge an inflated rate of a matured estate. *Wink Wink*

So when I got my keys, I laughed and told my
spouse : ‚ÄúHey you see we are under Marine Parade Town Council leh! Wow!!‚Äù

Planning areas are fixed and unchanging and only tangently related to the ever-changing constituency boundaries, if at all.

In Hong Kong, this is a more common sight where there are districts where people sundry seasoned pork to make ‚ÄòGolden Ham‚Äô and Chinese sausages ‚ÄòLap Cheongs‚Äô. They were also sundrying fishes and prawns to make salted fish and dried shrimps. It was extremely gross as these fresh produce are salted and seasoned fresh, and left out to sundry, so all the excess liquid and blood are dripping and giving off bad odour and smell.

There is a lot of other environmental impacts such as pests and food-hygiene issues that can arise. It is not right to write off this as a ‚Äòsmall inconvenience‚Äô.",t3_kyeunb,16-01-2021
967,16,gjfovss,t3_kyeunb,"This is someone who caught fish and dried it themselves.

This is a practice that doesn't hurt fisheries like fishing fleets with netting. It increases food security, which is something the government is very interested in doing. It's probably healthier than anything you can buy in the supermarket. And most likely it's been done by someone who benefits from obtaining their own food rather than buying it (ie., someone with lower income). Why does it bother you?

Edit: maybe the fish was bought fresh and the person put it to dry. In that case the above stands except maybe for not hurting fisheries.

My point is that while I understand some smells are not pleasant to some people, it's a minor inconvenience that can be easily avoided.

I get the concerns on hygiene and that they might be selling to other people, but this is really a more common practise than you might think. 

I'm just wondering, if the owner put the fishes into a rattan tray / container of some sort and put it onto the floor/chair to dry in the sun where people/cars/animals pass by, or if the owner was sitting nearby looking at it, would that still be an issue or would you have been fine with it?",t3_kyeunb,16-01-2021

1082,16,fmwanpm,t3_fxtipm,"> # 1,300 healthy foreign workers move into vacant premises at Jurong & Bedok camps

> Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced on Apr. 9 that healthy foreign workers would be housed at numerous empty premises such as SAF camps, HDB blocks, floating hotels and Changi Exhibition Centre.

> Wong revealed that around 5,000 workers have already moved out of their dormitories.

> This move follows a large spike in the number of confirmed cases at foreign worker dormitory clusters on Thursday.

> Over 200 out of the new 287 cases are linked to these clusters.

> Housing foreign workers at separate locations could potentially stem the increase in cases, and ensure these workers, some of whom are working in essential services, can continue to work.

> Moving in

> A Facebook post by Pioneer, an entity under SAFRA, showed foreign workers moving into a few SAF camps.

> Pioneer stated that around 1,300 foreign workers had moved into vacant premises at Jurong Camp II and Bedok Camp II under the instruction of the Ministry of National Development.

> More workers will be progressively moved into temporary accommodations such as these in the coming weeks.

> These premises are currently not being used by SAF, and are not required for their operational activities.

> Stringent precautionary measures have been put in place at the camps.

> Workers are required to register and undergo medical checks before moving into their accommodation.

> Any person with a fever or respiratory symptoms will be denied entry.

> Safe distancing measures at camps

> In compliance with safe distancing measures, workers will have their meals at staggered timings, as well as undergo twice daily temperature checks.

> This is to ensure the safety of both workers and SAF personnel.

> Hoarding has also been installed to segregate the workers' accommodation from the rest of the camp.

> Wong added during the Apr. 9 press conference that should workers fall sick, they should be immediately isolated to ensure these venues do not become clusters as well.

> Nice.

> You can check out this video by MINDEF.

PMD rider had a full 10 seconds to slow down and stop at the following traffic light, but chose to go through and avoid the enforcement officer, who took him down with a kick.

1127,16,fahpxep,t3_e9757a,"People are all up in arms about how the enforcement officer shouldn't have kicked the offending rider, but no one is talking about whether the officers received adequate training and equipment for enforcing PMD offences.

It's easy to sit behind a keyboard and say that the officers should have just taken note of the PMD license plate, and reported to LTA. What then if the license plate was removed, or if the rider covered his face to hide his identity? Even if LTA was able to track down the owner of the PMD, it just becomes a he-said-she-said situation. That's not even accounting for the difficulty in getting a good look of the license plate of a vehicle moving at speed, while you're on foot.

On top of all of that, it did not appear the offender had any intention of stopping. Not obeying the lawful instructions of law enforcement is almost unheard of in Singapore. Allowing the offender to get away would have only enabled more brazen disregard for the rule of law. Do people really think that the outcome of evading law enforcement is going to be a bed of roses?

Kicking the offender was probably not the best thing to do in this situation, and neither is celebrating the rider getting hurt.

Riding on the road using a PMD is dangerous, but it is not an ARRESTABLE offence (as per the Criminal Procedure Code and Penal Code) .  This means that the Aetos Officer was NOT legally enabled to use force in the first place. 

So what should the officer have done?  He should have let the errant PMD rider go first, call for backup and used surrounding cameras to identify him in the future.

Remember Alyosius Pang? He ignored SOP and became the next section and an example why SOPs need to be followed.

If you read the battle of Jutland, the British Navy nearly lost the war because idiots ignored the SOP. See, during peace time training and competition, British battleships and cruisers crews cut corners to speed up reload and increase rate of fire for competitions and for officers to get medals and promotions. Those medals and ranks meant jackshit when the ships were blown to kingdom come. They did this by leaving hatches to gunpowder magazine open to speed up reload. So in a ""real"" battle, one hit, and sparks and flame travelled down the magazine and blew the ships up. Ships after ships blew up and the Admiralty didn't know why. One of the newer ships, which had newer, less experienced crews, did not. Turned out the crew was new, so they did ""by the book"". Their accuracy was horrible, about half of others, but they stayed in the fight while the peace time ""better"" crews paid the ultimate price.

SOPs were written for a very good reason. Follow it, or the price can be in blood. If your supervisor is pressuring you to ignore it, often, it's not his blood that will be the price. It's yours or it will ultimately be you as the most proximate cause. Consider that before contravening them.

Common sense indeed.

>kick would send someone flying

I would caution the use of the term ""kick"" here. From the video, he made no swing motion to gather enough potential energy to justify it's use. To the untrained eye it may look like a Roundhouse kick but it ain't.

>however the law enforcement officer is at fault for taking matters into his own hands

Would you make the same case for any security/enforcement personnel discharging their duty?

I mean, if he isn't responsible for doing what is quite LITERALLY his job on scene, then pray tell who is?

>endangering the lives of the rider, himself and any bystanders

The errant rider was already doing this WITHOUT the on scene officer. Wtf you talking about fam? You need another case of an old lady dying to an errant rider for convincing? A precedent was already established.

>He should have did the proper procedure of taking down the license plate

An assumption on your part. I stated this in another comment, if LTA/Certis or even SPF had made a statement saying that this was indeed the Rules of Engagement (ROE) stipulated, then yes I would gladly take back my comment but they haven't have they?

> The Bedok tenant notorious for evading rent has made headlines in Shinmin Daily News again.

> The parties remain the same, with 67-year-old Shen Tianbao as tenant and 60-year-old Mr. He as landlord.

> Speaking to the Chinese daily, the landlord said that Shen had signed a contract for one year in mid-2019, for S$4,000 per month in rent.

> It was previously reported that the tenant had paid one month's rent before moving in, but started making excuses soon after.

> Since occupying the unit, Shen has reportedly not paid up and owes at least 17 months of rent, which amounts to S$68,000.

> While Landlord He has filed a case with the court for some time, the process was delayed due to Covid-19.

> It was only in August that the judgement in his favour was released.

> Shinmin reported that besides He, two other plaintiffs have also succeeded in their case against Shen.

> In He's case, the tenant was ordered to pay S$2,000 in legal fees.

> However, when Shen was presented with a lawyer's letter stating that he should move out before 5pm on Dec. 24, he apparently ripped it apart on the spot.

> The landlord told Shinmin that it was the first time he had encountered such an ""unbelievable"" person, and that he had been losing sleep over the case.

> He even wanted wanted to let Shen move out without paying rent, but tenant allegedly refused to leave.

> Landlord He has resorted to applying for a Writ of Possession, which would allow him to recover the debt through the court.

Adoption agencies all seem to be private, and are looking for people who want to adopt, no info for how to give your baby up. I have seen Motherhood forum posts of pregnant ladies asking for others to adopt their baby, so it seems kind of DIY? The MSF (Ministry) [website](https://www.msf.gov.sg/Adoption/Pages/default.aspx) on adoption is also all about how to adopt a child, not how to give one up.

There are some telephone hotlines to call in that newspaper article, but they are not well publicized and it's unclear what kind of advice they will give. If you look up the [Pregnancy Crisis Service](http://pregnancycrisis.sg/), it is clear that they are anti-abortion (""Give life a chance"") and the testimonials are from women who kept the baby and either got married or became single moms. No adoption stories.

With all this hush-hush and taboo, I can see how a scared, traumatized new mother might do something irrational. Not excusing them, but this country really needs to improve in making giving up a baby for adoption to be a simple, transparent process.",t3_el6j8w,07-01-2020

> Adoption

i. What is it: Adoption is the legal act of entrusting your child to another person/couple to bring him/her up as their own.

ii. To be eligible:

    The child must be a resident of Singapore (i.e. a Singapore Citizen, Singapore Permanent Resident or Dependant's Pass holder). A child is not regarded as a resident if the child is residing in Singapore on a visit pass, a student‚Äôs pass or a special pass. (see Section 4(7)(a)(b) of the Adoption of Child Act.)
    The child must be below 21 years of age (see Section 3(2) of the Adoption of Child Act.)
    Consent from both parents is needed if the biological father and/or mother is unmarried and below the age of 21 years

iii. Things to note: 

    It is against the law for biological parents to receive payments in return of giving up their child without the court‚Äôs approval.
    Teenage mothers must declare the details of the child‚Äôs father, and if the father is unknown, to state as unknown.

iv. How does this affect my child?

From the law‚Äôs perspective, all legal ties between your child and you will be broken off. The adoptive parent(s) will have all the rights and responsibilities in caring and educating the child.

Once the legal statement is signed and the child is surrendered, there is no ""turning back"".

v. Will my child be safe?

Child adoption in Singapore has a strict set of criteria and rules. Anyone who wishes to adopt a child from MSF will need to apply for a Home Study Report , which is conducted by professional social service staff. This is a comprehensive investigation to assess if the potential adoptive parents are ready for to adopt a child. They need to attend a Pre-Adoption Briefing (PAB) to ensure they are prepared and eligible to adopt. The adoptive parents will also be strongly encouraged to attend an Adoption Disclosure workshop.

vi. Other things to note

Placing your child for adoption can be traumatic (Source: Henney, Ayers-Lopez, McRoy, & Grotevant, 2007). You may experience grief, anger and guilt (Source: Child Welfare Information Gateway)

vii. Pre-Adoption Briefing

Attending a Pre-Adoption Briefing (available in 3 languages: English, Mandarin and Malay) is compulsory before identifying a child for adoption and applying for a home study or making an application to the Court. For detials on the available briefing sessions, click here.

A newborn baby has no papers and may not be ""eligible"". If the adoption wasn't arranged before birth, does the mother need to register the birth as her child first, then subsequently give it up? Which means she's responsible for caring for the baby for a few days, potentially creating a bond?  What if the baby isn't a SC, PR or DP holder e.g. FDW's baby. Is it illegal for her to give up the baby for adoption in Singapore?

Section 4 Restrictions on making adoption orders

subsection (4)  An adoption order shall not be made except with the consent of every person or body who is a parent or guardian of the infant in respect of whom the application is made or who has the actual custody of the infant or who is liable to contribute to the support of the infant; but the court may dispense with any consent required by this subsection if the court is satisfied that the person whose consent is to be dispensed with ‚Äî

(a)	has abandoned, neglected, persistently ill-treated the infant or cannot be found and that reasonable notice of the application for an adoption order has been given to the parent or guardian where the parent or guardian can be found;

(b)	is unfit by reason of any physical or mental incapacity to have the care and control of the infant, that the unfitness is likely to continue indefinitely and that reasonable notice of the application for an adoption order has been given to the parent or guardian; or

(c)	ought, in the opinion of the court and in all the circumstances of the case to be dispensed with, notwithstanding that such person may have made suitable initial arrangements for the infant by placing the infant under the care of the authorities of a home for children and young persons, the protector under the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap. 38) or some other person.",t3_el6j8w,07-01-2020

It's a necessary task, made no more easier by all the armchair critics and the down votes. As though it's your fault the info is out there the way it is, or it was your job to repackage the info into a neat nice package with a bow on top for others to consume.

I also don't understand how come it's this easy for people to just hand wave away 9 months to research, reach out for help, call a helpline, send an email, etc. with ""being scared"". Especially when you pieced it together in ~3 hours.

>          SINGAPORE - An e-scooter rider was arrested on Wednesday (March 14) for allegedly knocking down a woman in Bedok and seriously injuring her, before he fled the scene.
The police said in a statement on Thursday that the 23-year-old man was arrested for a rash act causing grievous hurt in last week&apos;s accident in Bedok Reservoir Road.
On March 7, the police received a report that a woman was knocked down by an unknown man riding an e-scooter at about 6pm. The woman, identified by Lianhe Wanbao as Ms Goh Lay Yong, was taken to Changi General Hospital with head injuries.
According to preliminary investigations, the man collided into the woman as he was unable to stop his e-scooter in time.
Ms Goh had just stepped off an overhead bridge and she lost consciousness immediately after she was hit. The man then left the scene after calling for an ambulance.
The police had put up an appeal on Monday, along with a photo of a man in a blue top.
Officers from the Bedok Police Division were able to establish the man&apos;s identity through extensive ground inquiries and with the aid of police camera footage.
The man was arrested in Bedok North Street 3 on Wednesday.
If convicted, he faces a jail term of up to four years, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.

>          SINGAPORE - A woman with head injuries was taken to hospital after she was allegedly hit by an electronic scooter in Bedok on Wednesday (March 7).
The police told The Straits Times that they were alerted to a case of rash act causing hurt at Block 151, Bedok Reservoir Road, at about 6pm.
A 45-year old woman was conscious when taken to the Changi General Hospital. Police investigations are ongoing. Lianhe Wanbao said in a report on Saturday that the woman involved was Ms Goh Lay Yong.
She told the evening daily in hospital on Saturday morning that she crosses the overhead bridge daily to and from work.
On Wednesday night, she was on her way home and had just stepped off the overhead bridge when she was hit by an e-scooter from the back, she said. Ms Goh said she lost consciousness immediately and woke up in an ambulance. Just this week, an e-scooter rider was given the [maximum fine of $2,500](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/three-e-scooter-riders-charged-with-injuring-pedestrians) after he admitted to injuring a boy while riding the device in a negligent manner.
The Straits Times had earlier reported that 110 accidents involving e-scooters were reported in the first nine months of last year, and the Government is cracking down on reckless riders.
It has accepted the Active Mobility Advisory Panel&apos;s proposal last month to [make registration of the devices mandatory](http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-mandatory-registration-of-e-scooters-from-second-half-of-2018).
As part of the registration process, users will have to provide their personal particulars as well as paste identification stickers prominently on their devices. They must also ensure that the devices meet requirements, such as a maximum weight of 20kg and a top speed of no more than 25kmh.
E-scooter users will have to register their devices from the second half of this year.

This is the same sample type you are using to argue e-scooters caused the 90 accidents.

> SINGAPORE - Civil defence officers forced their way into a Bedok North flat after a neighbour complained of a strong stench, and found an elderly man lying motionless among mounds of rubbish.

> Paramedics at the scene pronounced the 68-year-old dead, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) on Monday (Sept 30). Police have classified it as unnatural death.

> The SCDF said a hydraulic tool was used to forcibly enter the 12th-storey flat last Saturday.

> When The Straits Times visited it on Monday, a chain held shut the metal gate at the entrance. But the main wooden door was lying on piles of things the man had hoarded over the years. These included umbrellas, newspapers, magazines, toys and various things stuffed into plastic bags.

> Next-door neighbour Chin Tiong Wah, 50, who has lived there for the last 39 years, told The Straits Times that there was a fetid odour on Saturday morning when he left his home and on his return in the evening, it was overwhelming.

> Mr Chin, an associate director with a real estate agency, called the police at 9.17pm.

> The man, whose name has not been released officially, is among several cases reported in Singapore newspapers over the years of elderly people living alone, and whose deaths at home are not discovered until a few days later.

> In January this year, a 77-year-old man was found dead in his Tampines flat, after blood dripped through a neighbour's ceiling below.

> In December 2018, a 79-year-old man was found dead in his Beach Road flat after blood was seen seeping out of the flat.

> Related Story How hoarding crowds out family members

> In December 2017, a 68-year-old man was found dead near his bed in his Punggol flat after a social worker who went to visit him noticed a stench.

> Two days later, another man, 52, was found in a decomposed state in the living room of his Bedok flat.

> In last Saturday's incident, neighbours interviewed said the man lived alone, after his wife and two children, fed up with his hoarding habits, moved out many years ago.

> He kept to himself. An elderly woman on the 11th floor said he would walk by her flat regularly, without even nodding in friendly recognition.

> She added: ""Recently, he had lost a lot of weight and looked quite sick. He had to hold his pants up as he walked.""

> He would leave the discards he brought home at his door entrance and neighbours would ask the authorities to clear them.

> Mr Chin said the last time they were removed was on Sept 11.

> ""In the past weeks, we noticed the pile stayed untouched and did not grow,"" said Mr Chin, adding that several neighbours had expressed concern at his absence.

> Then a foul smell came from the flat, he added, leading him to call the police.

First of all, most of you guys just know how to speak but have done nothing for these cats, most of you guys have not even been on St John island to witness how poor the condition of these cats is. All what you guys do is to back up what the SJI team has done, thinking is the best way to care about these sick cats, without having been yourselves check at the situation. Of course, everybody can do this behind a screen, that's just what cowards do.

>To say that the St John island cats look ok is just a proof that you guys have no idea what welfare is. And where are we? In Asia, the continent where animal welfare is at its lowest. SPCA and these other associations do clearly nothing in terms of cat welfare, apart from neutering them, that's the only thing they do. Such a shame. Go travel to western countries and tell me if you see cats in the streets that look so sick and skinny like this. You won't because there's none like that there. And the welfare associations over there do their job, they aren't clowns like the ones here. If a cat would be seen like that over there, he would be taken care straight away in the most serious manner ever. And that's why this ""angmoh"" like you bunch of racists like to call him, decided to do: to be present with daily food and fresh water to provide the best quality of life for these cats, who at that time, already got used to their new environment. And we have been everyday with them, bringing food and changing the bowls. With this solution, it was also much easier to bring all these cats to the vet and monitor them, like we were already doing with two of them at Bedok. On top of our daily visit to these cats, many feeders also made sure they have constant food and fresh water. Plus they have shelters there, which they don't have at St John. Did the cats tell you personally that they like it to have no shelter when a storm is blowing on them? Did they tell you how it feels to be on an island which is closed for a year because of the asbestos? Well, wouldn't be surprised if most of you don't even know what asbestos is. Google it! Because it's currently being removed on St John and Kusu islands and this is the reason why most parts of these islands are now closed to the public. Does asbestos affect cat lungs too? Of course it does, same as for humans.

>And most of you guys stupidly believe all these false statements that SJI admin said, e.g. the cats were found malnourished and with gum disease ""BECAUSE"" we relocated them a couple of days ago. Another proof that you are just a bunch of stupid idiots with no knowledge of animal biology. A cat doesn't suddenly become so skinny in one week, and doesn't get gum disease and ulcers just in the same amount of time. This is a result of many months and years of malnutrition and dehydration, due to negligence for the past 4 years, where you revealed only lies, posted only the pictures of the who look the best, barely took any of these cats to the vet. You mentioned in another post that the last time one of the cats you just took away went to the vet was in 2016. Wow, seriously?! Once every 2 years? Yeah exactly, that's surely enough to call that ""I truly care for these cats"". Absolutely ridiculous. All our group members have experience with rescuing stray cats, some oversea and some here. If you don't believe what I say, go ask a vet yourself if a gum disease and kidney disease can just appear overnight and you will make yourself look like the biggest fool!

>The SJI admin lady is just a coward prick lady, who didn't even dare to show up the other night, but preferred to send her staff with carriers instead, ready to take the cats back with them instead of discussing with us how to give the cats the best QoL. How should I qualify this type of behaviour other than possessive and awful? She just wants to claim ownership of these cats just because she started to ""care"" about them for a couple of years now. Well, SJI admin lady or Angela since we all know your name now, your definition of ""care"" is obviously not our definition of ""care"". Going there only every 2 weeks and blindly trust some workers to feed them the remaining 13 days when it is obviously not done in the best and cleanest way, is a very wrong definition of ""care"". This kind of volunteer would already been condemned in other countries where welfare is at its best. How come other community cats in Singapore look so big and well cared? Just because of magic maybe? It's because they are fed with proper food and fresh water everyday! Seems to be so hard to understand for ignorant people like you, right? The SJI cats were obviously NOT well fed and it resulted in how they look like today and in all the diseases they are carrying. And now that we brought them to mainland for treatment, suddenly SJI team start to wake up and bring the to the vet, of course, much easier to bring them to the vet when they are already on the mainland, right? You just prove one of our main points to be correct. If the SJI team claims to be true caregiver, they would have brought these sick cats to the vet much earlier and as many times as needed, and they wouldn't be like this today. Use your brain sometimes, if you can, I know it's difficult. 
>
>And now SJI team wants to find re-homers for these sick cats. Anybody who know cats, especially stray cats, would just laugh out loud at that. Wild cats, especially when not that young anymore, do not fit well in a home. Can you imagine the difference of life they would have to face from being out in the wild to being in an confined area? How would you react if I do that to you? These cats need to be out and stay out, that's where they're the happiest. They were totally fine where we relocated them and it should have stayed like this. When others wanted to re-home them, you said they don't know anything. If the rescuers didn't take them out of SJI, the cats would just die a slow death there, especially the ones that ""suddenly"" need a blood transfusion. You are just all pathetic people.

>Now they have all been taken away by the possessive SJI team, who thinks they know everything better than the rest, go ahead. And to most of the ignorant pricks out here who believe everything SJI admin lady narrates to you, continue to act like a sheep.

>4. The cats have been fed everyday by the people who relocated them as well as by feeders in these areas. Photos were showed to authorities. Some of the cats even put on weight already.
>5. Two cats that needed vet attention were also brought to the vet and are given treatments. Others were taken away before they were able to be taken to the vet.
>6. The group apologized for not informing SJI admin of this operation, however even if they did SJI admin would not have collaborated or allowed this to happen. The cats would still be at SJI and not be with fosterers as they are today.
>7. The cats were removed from these new spots by SJI team, even though they adapted well in their new environment, were fed everyday and had shelters. In other words, the cats are now taken away from the freedom they had.

I looked up FishBase and I think this is the closest match: [Lagoon Shrimp Goby](http://www.fishbase.org/summary/Cryptocentrus-cyanotaenia.html) (*Cryptocentrus cyanotaenia*). [More photos here](http://www.chaloklum-diving.com/marine-life-guide-koh-phangan/fish-reptiles-squirts-chordata/bony-fish-osteichthyes/gobies-gobiidae/shrimp-gobies/lagoon-shrimp-goby-cryptocentrus-cyanotaenia/).

These gobies have an interesting partnership with pistol shrimps - the goby will look for a burrow occupied by a pistol shrimp, and move in as well. The shrimp is good at burrowing, but has poor eyesight, whereas the goby has good eyesight but is lousy at digging. So while the shrimp is busy with excavating and maintaining the burrow, the goby sits at the entrance, keeping an eye out for predators. Meanwhile, the shrimp will have one of its antennae in constant contact with the goby, and if the goby senses danger and darts into the burrow, its movements help warn the shrimp to take cover as well. [Here's a video](https://youtu.be/jnJ5iFEU6xg) illustrating this partnership.

> Maternal instincts in at least two women in Singapore have kicked in as they have stepped forward to offer to adopt the baby that was found in a rubbish chute bin at Block 534 Bedok North Street 3 on Tuesday morning.

> Advertisement

> The two women wrote to The New Paper to offer to adopt the baby boy after reading about the case.

> According to media reports, two cleaners heard crying sounds emanating from one of the bins and one of them dug through bags of rubbish before finding the baby in a tied-up white plastic bag.

> Naked and crying loudly, the baby boy still had blood on his body and his umbilical cord was still attached.

> The police are investigating and have gone door to door to conduct interviews.

> The baby‚Äôs parents are still at large.

> Advertisement

> Women step forward

> One of the women who came forward is Susan Tan, 40.

> She told TNP she works in human resources and lives in a four-room flat with her husband, their two daughters, aged 11 and nine, and a helper.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very sad that someone would throw the baby in the rubbish like this. As much as it is tragic, he is a very lucky baby to have survived,‚Äù she told TNP over the phone.

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing to take care of him for as long as it takes. But if his parents are found and want him back, I‚Äôm also willing to give him back.‚Äù

> She also said she has yet to discuss the adoption with her husband, who is in his 40s.

> But she said: ‚ÄúI think my husband would be happy because he would love to have a boy.‚Äù

> The other woman named Wong said in her e-mail that she sympathises with the baby‚Äôs plight.

> She said she would be glad to take care of the baby if no one is found to care for him.

> Advertisement

> Adoption process in Singapore is about one year long

> Adopting a child in Singapore requires fulfilling a list of criteria under the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) regulations.

> Rules pertaining to age state that both the prospective adopters must be at least 25 years old and at least 21 years older than the child.

> The adoptive parents should not be more than 50 years older than the child.

> Adopters must be Singapore residents.

> Single males are not allowed to adopt a girl, but there can be exceptions.

> Prospective adopters must also attend a compulsory pre-adoption briefing.

> This is done before a home study report application.

> This is followed by an eligibility assessment by one of four accredited voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) here.

> TNP reported that it was told by one of the VWOs that the process can be long.

> The home study report, which comprises interviews with the applicants and a home visit, can take two to three months.

> Background checks are carried out on the applicants to assess their medical history and criminal record.

> Once the child is adopted, the last stage of the process will see the adoptive parents apply to the Family Court with the required documents for an Adoption Order.

> This legal process can take another six to nine months to complete.

> The MSF website said there were 433 applicants for adoption in 2018 and 375 in 2017.

> SINGAPORE: It was a regular evening for Station Inspector¬†Sofian Othman, who was on his day off and buying a sandwich at Bedok Mall for an early dinner. But he soon realised that something was not quite right as he was leaving the mall, as he heard loud shouts coming from the McDonald&apos;s a short distance away.

> That was when he realised that a young man was behaving aggressively, intimidating mall shoppers. Some looked scared, and quickly left the mall.

> In his first interview with the media on Thursday (Jan 4), the 35-year-old investigation officer with the Unlicensed Moneylending Strikeforce recounted how he came to help detain an 18-year-old man for [causing trouble with a pair of scissors](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/police-arrest-man-with-scissors-at-bedok-mall-9813928) at Bedok Mall last Wednesday.

> The incident, which happened at about 6pm, saw the young man damage property at several stores in the neighbourhood mall.

> Frightened shopkeepers and customers scrambled for safety as the man went about messing up items on display, shoving things to the floor and shouting at shoppers. The teenager also smashed the glass panels of some stores.

> ""My main concern was the safety of members of public and the damage that he would cause to the surrounding,"" said Mr Sofian, who has been in the force for 14 years.

> Following his ""police officer&apos;s instinct"", Mr Sofian followed the young man from behind as he made his way into yet another shop, a watch store. By this time, a couple of other male shoppers were also trailing the man, seeing if they could help.

> Mr Sofian signalled to one of them that he would approach the young man from behind, and attempt to catch him unaware and disarm him. The opportunity soon came as the man turned his back to Mr Sofian to sweep more items off the counter of the shop.

> It took five men, including Mr Sofian, to pin down the teenager.

>        The 35-year-old Station Inspector lauded the SGSecure programme as being key to raising public awareness on what to do when encountering difficult security situations. (Photo: Christy Yip)   

> ""It was a bit chaotic at that time as (he) was behaving aggressively,"" recalled Mr Sofian.

> The first question Mr Sofian asked the teenager was if he was okay.¬†

> ‚ÄúI engaged him in conversation to find out about his condition ‚Äì whether he was injured, or if he needed any immediate medication. He mentioned that he was on medication but he did not have it on him. So to calm him down, I offered him a bottle of drink.‚Äù

> Mr Sofian had earlier bought a bottle of water to go with his sandwich dinner. The young man appeared disoriented, but calmed down soon after.

> The police arrived several minutes after and arrested the man.

>        Station Inspector Sofian Othman&apos;s¬†main concern was the safety of members of the public and the damage that the man would cause to the surroundings. (Photo: Christy Yip)   

> In a Facebook post update on evening of the incident, the police said that the man had a history of mental health problems and was arrested for public nuisance. Investigations are ongoing.

> ""I was quite heartened to see members of the public being very alert and coming forward to assist in this kind of situation,"" said Mr Sofian.

> He lauded the SGSecure programme as being key to reaching out to members of the public on what to do when encountering difficult security situations. However, he also reminded the public that personal safety should come first, and not to put themselves in harm&apos;s way at any time.¬†

> The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) had announced on Jun. 21 that mosques would gradually resume daily congregational and Friday prayers starting from Jun. 26, 2020.

> Mosque closed on Jul. 7 evening and Jul. 8 for cleaning

> MOH said that it notified Masjid Al-Ansar on Jul. 7 that a confirmed case of Covid-19 had visited the mosque for evening prayers between Jun. 26 and Jul. 2.

> As a precautionary measure, Masjid Al-Ansar was closed from the evening of Jul. 7 as well as on Jul. 8, to allow for comprehensive cleaning and disinfection.

> The mosque resumed prayer services on Jul. 9, and Friday prayer will be carried out as planned on Jul. 10.

> Dates and times visited by Covid-19 case

> Because of the processes that mosques have put in place, said MOH, the individual was able to be traced.

> The full list of dates and times of the Covid-19 case's visit are as follows:

> Jun. 26 from 8:43pm to 8:59pm

> Jun. 27 from 7:25pm to 7:39pm and 8:36pm to 8:54pm

> Jul. 1 from 8:32pm to 8:55pm

> Jul. 2 from 8:34pm to 8:51pm

> The system allows for reservation of available prayer spaces for daily and Friday congregational prayers.

> Entry to mosques is only available through SafeEntry using NRIC/FIN, and usage of the TraceTogether app is strongly encouraged.

> For Friday prayers, there will be two 30-minute prayer sessions, with a half-hour interval between the two sessions for safe crowd management.

> Sermons and prayers are shortened to a maximum of 20 minutes, and there is a maximum limit of 50 congregants per prayer session.

> People who visited mosque during specified times should monitor health

> Restricting the time worshippers can spend in the mosque made contact with each other transient, said MOH.

> MOH has also confirmed that other worshippers are at low risk of being infected.

> Nevertheless, MUIS advises members of the public who have been to Masjid Al-Ansar at these specified times to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit. They should seek treatment if they do not feel well.

> MUIS would like to remind the community to remain vigilant, follow all safe management procedures stipulated by our mosques, and stay home if unwell.

> In particular, vulnerable groups (i.e. the elderly, children, and those with chronic respiratory conditions) are strongly encouraged not to come to the mosque and to perform their prayers at home instead.

> SINGAPORE - A 74-year-old man who lived in Bedok Reservoir Road is the first person to die from the dengue virus this year, Chinese evening paper Shin Min Daily News reported on Saturday (Feb 9).

> No further details of the case are known for now. The Straits Times has contacted the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Health Ministry for more information.

> Pritam also expressed appreciation for the police and AHTC Kaki Bukit office staff for assisting in the incident.

> Don‚Äôt jump to conclusion

> While his heart goes out to the baby, just like the rest of Singapore, Pritam also reminded commenters to avoid jumping to conclusions prematurely and passing judgements on the parents or whoever that dumped the child.

> Here‚Äôs a conversation in the comment section between Pritam and a Facebook user, where Pritam expressed his hope that the child‚Äôs parents will seek help.

1913,16,g21h6ja,t1_g1z0qmv,"Let's be clear here, what the mother has done is not an attempted murder. Its negligence and abandonment. If she had wanted to murder, abortion/strangling the baby or using the scissors to cut the baby would have done the job better.

She cleaned up all her blood because the place is dirtied by it, as is common with EVERYONE WHO SPILLS BODILY FLUID IN THEIR HOMES. Mothers who just gave birth requires rest, as is common with ALMOST ALL MOTHERS. And if you believe every single  colourful word spoken by the prosecutor, boy have i got a bridge to sell you. The prosecutor's job is to make up a story based on evidence in an attempt to pin the crime to the defendant, it is wise to take their story telling with a grain of salt.

While the psychiatrist said that she did not suffer from major mental illness (whatever that is) and that her postpreg depression did not contribute to her actions. The emotional trauma of going into the toilet to poop only to find out a freaking baby is sticking out of your V is not something that is common on earth. And the shock that was presented to her at the time could have led her to make the bad decision of abandoning the baby.

Disclaimer: I do not condone what she did and if her ignorance of the pregnancy is true, then this is a case of person in a bad situation making a bad decision. I would empathise with her as much as the child which in the grand scheme of things, both are victims to their bad fate.",t3_ibyab0,18-08-2020

1915,16,g227u13,t1_g21h6ja,"Very well, I agree with certain points, such as the words of the prosecutor being necessarily biased or that there are other more efficient ways to murder the baby had she so desired. However I still believe that even if its just negligence and abandonment, it is still abandonment with the intent for the baby to die. If she just wanted to abandon the baby, likewise there are other more humane method of doing so such as putting the baby in a blanket box and leaving it somewhere for people to find and adopt, however ridiculous it may sound.

However that wasn't her first course of action, she instead went to throw the baby down the chute. We associate the chute with trash, waste that should be disposed of and brought to the incinerator. I understand that suddenly giving birth without knowing what happened can be shocking and traumatising, and can lead people to perform drastic actions. If so, then she should have been too stunned and shocked to think of anything else and should have thrown the baby down into the chute immediately, why bother thinking of tying it up in a plastic bag like we do with trash?

Your argument is valid in some parts, and I do agree that there are other circumstances and scenarios surrounding this case that could have shed further light on the exact situation. However I still stand by my belief that she planned to murder the baby, or at the very least planned to abandon the baby with the intention of their death or the complete disregard of their life.",t3_ibyab0,19-08-2020

> SINGAPORE: Precautionary tuberculosis screening will be conducted for certain patrons of Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre after 18 cases were detected through retrospective testing, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday (Jan 20).

> 

> The health ministry said it has been notified of two ‚Äúgenetically separate‚Äù clusters involving a total of 18 people diagnosed with tuberculosis who had prolonged exposure at the Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""The cases had immediately started treatment following diagnosis and are not a current ongoing public health risk,"" said MOH, adding that the risk of transmission to people who are not close contacts is very low.

> 

> As a precautionary measure, officers from the Singapore TB Elimination Programme (STEP) will be contacting patrons who visited Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre between Feb 12 and Mar 25 last year for screening.

> 

> Screening will be conducted free of charge at the Tuberculosis Control Unit (TBCU) at 142 Moulmein Road.

> 

> Voluntary screening will also be offered to former patrons who spent prolonged durations, which MOH defined as ""cumulatively days"", at the Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre to watch live horse-racing telecasts between 2018 and Mar 25, 2020.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Patrons who wish to be screened may call the TBCU hotline at 6258 4430, said the health ministry.

> 

> In line with the health ministry‚Äôs tuberculosis prevention strategy, officers from STEP had earlier initiated contact investigations upon notification of each of the cases.

> 

> Close contacts of all the 18 cases had already been identified and contacted by STEP for screening, said MOH.

> 

> The two clusters were determined by genetic sequencing and epidemiological investigations which concluded in January 2021, as part of retrospective testing of tuberculosis cases to determine linkages. The 18 cases were diagnosed between February 2015 and October 2020.

> 

> Advertisement

> NO COMMON LINKS ASIDE FROM SINGAPORE POOLS

> The link among five cases diagnosed between July 2018 and February 2020 was established and MOH said it was notified of the cluster on Jul 28, 2020.

> The 13 cases in the second cluster, who were diagnosed between February 2015 and October 2020, were notified to MOH between Dec 1, 2020 and January 11, 2021.

> 

> The health ministry said investigations into the cases did not reveal any common links, other than that they had all frequently visited the Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre over a period ranging from months to years and spent prolonged durations at the centre watching live horse-racing telecasts.

> 

> The cases did not know each other, and had not identified each other as close contacts.

> 

> While screening is not compulsory, MOH strongly encouraged these individuals to be screened.

> 

> Those with positive screening results will be offered appropriate advice and follow-up. Those with active tuberculosis will be treated immediately while those with latent non-infectious tuberculosis will be monitored and treated if necessary.

> 

> MOH said screening for individuals who had visited the Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre or its vicinity, but did not spend prolonged time watching horse-racing telecasts, is assessed to be unnecessary due to the very low risk of transmission posed to such individuals.

> 

> The health ministry said tuberculosis is typically spread through close and prolonged contact with an infectious individual, and not by contact with items or surfaces touched by an infected person.

> 

> Those who are contacted and screened following the detection of a tuberculosis individual typically comprise family members, close workplace colleagues and acquaintances from common social activities with close and regular interaction.

> 

> This approach is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is practised in Singapore, added MOH.

> 

> Tuberculosis is endemic in Singapore and latent tuberculosis infection is not uncommon here, as tuberculosis has been prevalent in Singapore until the 1970s and older Singaporeans could have been exposed to tuberculosis and acquired latent tuberculosis infection when they were younger.

> 

> Persons with latent tuberculosis do not experience symptoms of TB and are not infectious, said MOH.

> 

> ""Tuberculosis is curable and the spread of tuberculosis is preventable. Early detection and prompt treatment of cases remain important in helping those infected and rendering them non-infectious. For individuals diagnosed with active tuberculosis, adherence to treatment is important.""

> SINGAPORE - A strong burning smell was reported over several parts of eastern Singapore on Friday morning (Feb 8), including Tampines, Bedok and Pasir Ris.

> Mr Jon Lee, 45, who lives in Tampines, likened the smell to the haze or offerings being burnt during the Chinese seventh month.

> ""I was taking my son to school on the way to work at around 6am, and there was a strong burning smell. At 7am, when I dropped my son off in the East Coast area, it was still there,"" said Mr Lee, who works in sales.

> He told The Straits Times that there was no burning smell when he reached his workplace in the west. He added that his colleague who lives in Bedok also described a similar burning smell.

> A reader, who wished to be known only as Ms Tan, said she noticed the smell when she reached the void deck of her Tampines home after 7am.

> ""The smell was pretty strong, and when I got to the bus stop I could see that it was a bit hazy. Things looked blurry from a distance,"" said the 24-year-old trainee teacher.

> Another reader who did not wish to be named also said she noticed a strong burning smell. She said the smell was similar to the haze.

> Related Story ST readers complain of strong burning smell in the east of Singapore

> ""I smelled it once I woke up around 7.30am and stepped out of my room. I went to the balcony to see if someone was burning something, but I didn't really see anything,"" said the 23-year-old, who works in public relations.

> Facebook user Han Han, in a post at about 7.25am, said it smelled like ""burnt leaves"".

> When ST reached the Tampines area at about 8.30am, a strong burning smell was in the air.

> Some pedestrians were spotted donning face masks at Tampines Central Park.

> The air around the park was visibly hazy, with buildings in the distance appearing unclear and obscured.

> At about 10am, the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) value listed on the National Environment Agency's (NEA's) website was 63, which is in the ""moderate"" range of 51 to 100.

> The figure for the east at 10am was higher than for other regions, which were 26 for the west, 35 in the north, 46 for the central region and 53 in the south.

> The one-hour PM2.5 reading at 10am was 62 for eastern Singapore, which is within the ""elevated"" range of 56 to 150. PM2.5 is the dominant pollutant during haze episodes, according to the NEA.

> The NEA's data showed that PM2.5 readings for the east have been increasing steadily, from 48 at 2am to 60 at 9am.

> The other PM2.5 readings at 10am were seven for the west, 14 in north, 13 for the central region and 10 in the south.

> As of 9am, the Singapore Civil Defence Force said it had not received any reports of incidents that may have caused the smell.

> ST has contacted the NEA for more information.

> SINGAPORE:¬†From an old skate park to a multipurpose building with a range of facilities bringing different services together under one roof, Heartbeat@Bedok aims to serve as a lifestyle hub for residents of all ages.¬†

> The seven storey building, with a land area that makes up the size of about three football fields, was officially open on Sunday (Feb 4) by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.¬†

> Heartbeat@Bedok houses multiple agencies managing different facilities, such as the sports centre, the¬†[Bedok public library](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/bedok-public-library-reopens-with-new-digital-and-senior-9353328), Kampong Chai Chee Community Club, [Bedok Polyclinic](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/bedok-polyclinic-to-open-at-new-complex-end-july-9024474)¬†and a Senior Care Centre that has yet to open.¬†

> There are also more than 30 retailers including F&B outlets, sports specialty shops and¬†childcare and education centres. The amenities have been opening in phases from July 2017.¬†

> Rain or shine, sport enthusiasts will not have to worry about working out, with four swimming pools featuring aqua related programmes, as well as eight indoor badminton courts and six sheltered tennis courts on the rooftop.¬†

>        Heartbeat@Bedok was officially open on Sunday (Feb 4) by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. (Photo: Rachelle Lee)¬†
   

> The concept of Heartbeat@Bedok is almost similar to Our Tampines Hub, and Grassroots advisor Lee Yi Shyan said: ‚ÄúWhen we started to brainstorm on this idea, we never knew the Our Tampines Hub was in parallel, being developed. It was a pure coincidence. It was only much later that we realised‚Äù.¬†

> Mr Lee added that it‚Äôs a more efficient use of land now that all the public facilities are congregated together in one place.¬†

> ‚ÄúIn the past, we had all the amenities in a distributed fashion. The community centre was at one place, the library and polyclinic at another place.¬†

> ""When we had a chance to rebuild, we thought it might be a good idea to bring everyone under one roof so that residents can access all these service within short distances. In terms of the freed up land, it‚Äôs important to provide new housing options for young families to inject a younger population into this otherwise rather matured and also older demographics‚Äù.¬†

> With the amenities brought together, Mr Lee also said that this allows the agencies to do more than just providing services for the residents, but also come together to organise integrated programmes. He said it is a requirement that all the agencies have a minimum of 40 per cent¬†of their services to be co-delivered at Heartbeat.¬†

> The polyclinic, for example, has been working with People‚Äôs Association to refer its patients for healthy cooking classes, and it also collaborated with ActiveSG to send some patients for a gym orientation.

> ‚ÄúWe want to create a healthy ecosystem for our patients beyond the borders of our clinic. These referrals are mainly aimed at patients with chronic and lifestyle diseases so they can learn to pick up healthier habits and be less sedentary. We look forward to scaling up such tie-ups with the other agencies here so that patients that come to us are also healthier and it becomes a win win situation,‚Äù said Dr Juliana Bahadin, Clinic Director, Bedok Polyclinic.¬†

> To ensure the Heartbeat meets the needs of residents, a series of consultation were launched with some 11,000 people to get ideas and feedback on the type of programmes they would like.¬†

> According to Mr Lee, about 14 to 18 per cent of residents in Bedok are aged 65 and above. Hence, many of the activities at Heartbeat are related to social and physical wellness.¬†

> SINGAPORE: Precautionary tuberculosis screening will be conducted for certain patrons of Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre after 18 cases were detected through retrospective testing, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday (Jan 20).

> 

> The health ministry said it has been notified of two ‚Äúgenetically separate‚Äù clusters involving a total of 18 people diagnosed with tuberculosis who had prolonged exposure at the Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""The cases had immediately started treatment following diagnosis and are not a current ongoing public health risk,"" said MOH, adding that the risk of transmission to people who are not close contacts is very low.

> 

> As a precautionary measure, officers from the Singapore TB Elimination Programme (STEP) will be contacting patrons who visited Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre between Feb 12 and Mar 25 last year for screening.

> 

> Screening will be conducted free of charge at the Tuberculosis Control Unit (TBCU) at 142 Moulmein Road.

> 

> Voluntary screening will also be offered to former patrons who spent prolonged durations, which MOH defined as ""cumulatively days"", at the Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre to watch live horse-racing telecasts between 2018 and Mar 25, 2020.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Patrons who wish to be screened may call the TBCU hotline at 6258 4430, said the health ministry.

> 

> In line with the health ministry‚Äôs tuberculosis prevention strategy, officers from STEP had earlier initiated contact investigations upon notification of each of the cases.

> 

> Close contacts of all the 18 cases had already been identified and contacted by STEP for screening, said MOH.

> 

> The two clusters were determined by genetic sequencing and epidemiological investigations which concluded in January 2021, as part of retrospective testing of tuberculosis cases to determine linkages. The 18 cases were diagnosed between February 2015 and October 2020.

> 

> Advertisement

> NO COMMON LINKS ASIDE FROM SINGAPORE POOLS

> The link among five cases diagnosed between July 2018 and February 2020 was established and MOH said it was notified of the cluster on Jul 28, 2020.

> The 13 cases in the second cluster, who were diagnosed between February 2015 and October 2020, were notified to MOH between Dec 1, 2020 and Jan 11, 2021.

> 

> The health ministry said investigations into the cases did not reveal any common links, other than that they had all frequently visited the Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre over a period ranging from months to years and spent prolonged durations at the centre watching live horse-racing telecasts.

> 

> The cases did not know each other, and had not identified each other as close contacts.

> 

> While screening is not compulsory, MOH strongly encouraged these individuals to be screened.

> 

> Those with positive screening results will be offered appropriate advice and follow-up. Those with active tuberculosis will be treated immediately while those with latent non-infectious tuberculosis will be monitored and treated if necessary.

> 

> MOH said screening for individuals who had visited the Singapore Pools Bedok Betting Centre or its vicinity, but did not spend prolonged time watching horse-racing telecasts, is assessed to be unnecessary due to the very low risk of transmission posed to such individuals.

> 

> The health ministry said tuberculosis is typically spread through close and prolonged contact with an infectious individual, and not by contact with items or surfaces touched by an infected person.

> 

> Those who are contacted and screened following the detection of a tuberculosis individual typically comprise family members, close workplace colleagues and acquaintances from common social activities with close and regular interaction.

> 

> This approach is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is practised in Singapore, added MOH.

> 

> Tuberculosis is endemic in Singapore and latent tuberculosis infection is not uncommon here, as tuberculosis has been prevalent in Singapore until the 1970s and older Singaporeans could have been exposed to tuberculosis and acquired latent tuberculosis infection when they were younger.

> 

> People with latent tuberculosis do not experience symptoms of TB and are not infectious, said MOH.

> 

> ""Tuberculosis is curable and the spread of tuberculosis is preventable. Early detection and prompt treatment of cases remain important in helping those infected and rendering them non-infectious. For individuals diagnosed with active tuberculosis, adherence to treatment is important.""

> SINGAPORE - A would-be robber hoped to walk away from a Bedok pawn shop with handfuls of gold jewellery on Friday afternoon (July 12) - but ended up fleeing empty-handed after his chopper broke when he tried to smash open a glass display case.

> Employees said the masked man entered ValueMax at Block 213 Bedok North Street 1 brandishing the blade, then swung it on the glass counter.

> Although the thick glass counter cracked slightly, it did not break - unlike his weapon which snapped into two pieces.

> After picking the pieces up, the culprit fled without having taken anything.

> Police are investigating the incident after being alerted just before 2pm.

> An employee at the shop, Mr Choo Yong Chang, 66, said he believed the culprit was in his 40s.

> The Straits Times visited the shop at around 4pm when business appeared to have returned to normal, although a piece of masking tape covered the cracked display case.

> Mr Choo told reporters that while the shop was insured, the staff there were afraid the man would hack at them with the weapon.

> Related Story Police arrest man who threatened to blow up pawnshop after failed robbery attempt

> In August last year, a ValueMax pawn shop near Boon Lay MRT station also survived a robbery attempt when Bangladeshi national Sheikh Md Razan, 29, threw an object on the shop's counter, falsely claiming it was a bomb.

> He also failed to steal anything and was arrested five days later.

> He was later charged with attempted armed robbery.

For all we know, all the mutually conflicting religions might be just some sort of divine test and whoever was aggressively evangelising might have just failed it. No one will know because no one can go and check it.

Oh, and don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs in whatever version of religious text you believe in. Unless God don‚Äôt exist in our linear time and for God, the past, present, and future is the same and everything that needs to be thought about was thought, I‚Äôm pretty sure God is entitled to change the intentions occasionally. Its not like it hasn‚Äôt happened before...

Who are we mere mortals to say things wasn‚Äôt changed? Why would God be constrained and have to conform to whatever that was told to humans, or worse, conform to whatever weird interpretations by mere humans?

Plus, anyone who played any party game on passing on messages will know that all messages will not survive intact. All messages will be distorted by the biases and intentions of every intermediate messenger. Who knows how much the original message/intention was distorted, especially after millennia of corrupt mortals passing on the message!

Anyone looking into human history will know that religion has always been misused to justify the desires of humans.

It‚Äôs okay to believe in God and have God guide your life in whatever way and purpose. But, don‚Äôt go and think your version and interpretation is the *only* correct one. Unless God directly told you or your pastor or your head of religion that, who are we mere mortals to say who is correct and who is wrong?

I mean, if for those religionists, their heart is already opened to God, then needless to say, God can and will guide them, even if it *means doing things that makes little sense or even contradict the interpretations they know*. Why would God lead them astray for no reason? There‚Äôs no need for them to be obsessed with dogma and specifics, and certainly much less need to obey the whims of some human clergy.

I would encourage you to go explore more cultures and religion just for fun if you are interested. You‚Äôll realise a lot of similarities yet a lot of dissimilarities which will help you be more introspective towards your own religion.",t3_j9r3gj,12-10-2020
2124,16,g8ogcju,t1_g8odjz4,"Yeah that boggles my mind too. Imo you cannot be a scientist and still believe in religion. Science literally goes against religious believes (not the concept of a creator or god though. just regions believes) 

You can't just pick apart and choose to believe only the certain parts of a religion and forget the rest. Ergo, you cannot believe in science and still call yourself a religious person.",t3_j9r3gj,13-10-2020
