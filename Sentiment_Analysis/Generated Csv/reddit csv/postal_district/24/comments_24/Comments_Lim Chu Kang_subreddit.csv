No its a good question that poses real challenges in firefighting. If you mean the water hoses used to transport water (not pipes, hoses arent metal)

It can handle for awhile but if vehicles keep rolling over a fully charged hose with water it will burst.

> SINGAPORE - The warmer weather in recent days may have caused thousands of fish to die in waters near Lim Chu Kang jetty and in nearby fish farms.

> The fish started surfacing in the sea about two or three days ago, said Mr Simon Ho, communications officer at the Singapore's Fish Farmers Association.

> ""Because of the higher temperatures these few days, there's a lack of oxygen in the water. I believe the fishes died as a result,"" he noted.

> He added that fish farmers in the area sent motorboats out to remove and dispose of the dead fish.

> About four or five farms are said to have been affected with each reporting a loss of about one to two tonnes of fishon average - estimated to be worth from $3,000 to $4,000.

> Mr Ho said deaths like this one happen ""one or two times in a year"" and the phenomenon is ""not unusual"".

> He added that some fish farms have machines to replenish the oxygen in the water.

> Related Story Scores of dead fish found at Lim Chu Kang jetty

> Related Story New mass fish death washes up thousands at Lim Chu Kang jetty

> Mr Ho, who has been a fish farmer for around 10 years, said it is possible to tell with experience that the oxygen conditions in the water are below normal levels. Fish behaviour can alert farmers as well.

> ""When the oxygen in the water is insufficient, some of the more active fishes will move less than usual,"" he added.

> A mass death occurred in 2015 when around 600 tonnes of fish died in a span of two weeks due to a plankton bloom, with farms near the East Johor Straits the worst-hit.

> A bloom happens when the plankton multiply rapidly due to warmer temperatures in the water. Plankton suck oxygen from the water, threatening marine life.

> It is unclear if the fish deaths this time occurred because of the same reason.

> ""These are costs that small fish farms like us have to bear from time to time,"" Mr Ho added.

> ""With nature, you never can tell. Anything could happen.""

> SINGAPORE - The strongest wind gust in eight years was recorded during Friday&apos;s thunderstorm which wrought damage to several farms in Lim Chu Kang.

> Wind speed hit a high of 133.3kmh in Tengah at 3.50pm on Friday (March 30), said the Meteorological Service Singapore on Saturday.

> ""This is the strongest wind gust recorded at our islandwide network of wind sensors since 2010,"" it said. Meanwhile, the highest recorded wind gust is 144.4kmh, also in Tengah, on April 25, 1984.

> Several farms, ranging from a chicken farm to plant nurseries, suffered damage when widespread thundery showers fell over Singapore between 2.10pm and 5pm on Friday. Rain was heaviest over the western parts of the island around Jurong and Choa Chu Kang, said the meteorological service.

> Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry and National Development, Dr Koh Poh Koon, said on Saturday afternoon that government agencies will support farmers&apos; cleanup and rebuilding efforts.

> Dr Koh visited affected farms in Murai Farmway near the Lim Chu Kang Cemetery earlier in the day, along with chief executives of the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) and the National Parks Board (NParks), as well as key members of the Singapore Agro-Food Enterprises Federation.

> On top of AVA and NParks, Singapore Land Authority and the Building and Construction Authority will also step in to help, said Dr Koh in a Facebook post.

> Farms hit the hardest by Friday&apos;s storm were Chew&apos;s Agriculture, Williton Orchids, Koon Lee Nursery and Goh Swee Hoon fish farm.

> Chew&apos;s Agriculture was the worst hit, with some chicken houses left ""completely flattened"", said Dr Koh.

> ""The farmers shared with me that they now see the unpredictable and damaging effect of more extreme weather patterns on their livelihood due to climate change and are determined to leverage better technology to mitigate against disruptions,"" he added.

> A 38-year-old worker at a plant nursery was taken to hospital for minor injuries.

> Mangled buildings and felled trees littered Murai Farmway when The Straits Times visited on Saturday afternoon.

> At Chew&apos;s Agriculture, stray chickens were seen among the debris which was their home less than a day ago. The chicken farm declined to comment.

> A factory employee who declined to be named said the rain, which started before 4pm on Friday, came in ""like a tsunami"".

> ""Many chickens died. Some escaped,"" he said.

> Said another worker from Chew&apos;s: ""Suddenly, the tin houses on both sides of the road started shaking. Everyone went inside, nobody dared to go outside. In 15 minutes, the trees started falling down.""

> Tucked away in a side alley, Sevenseas Fisheries suffered fewer battle scars than its neighbour. But the fish and frog farm will still need at least two weeks before it returns to its former state, said operations manager Bernard Goh.

> The family business had to stop all operations on Friday afternoon when the storm tore through its premises. ""Yesterday, we totally couldn&apos;t operate at all. We are now trying to rush out some major repairs so operations can run,"" said Mr Goh on Saturday.

> Damage includes broken water pipes and electric cables, cutting off the farm&apos;s water filtration system. The automated system supplies fresh water from a larger reserve pond to the farm&apos;s fish and frog ponds. It now has to use a handheld pump, which supplies only 20 per cent of the original volume of water.

> The storm also ripped the roof off its frog enclosure.

> As a stopgap measure, Mr Goh laid wire mesh on the top to ward off direct sunlight. Roof repairs for the enclosure will be done next week.

> But Mr Goh is afraid poor weather in the week ahead will spawn a nightmarish rerun of Friday&apos;s events.

> ""We are scared it will rain again today. The weather forecast says it will rain this whole week in the afternoon,"" he said on Saturday.

> A 29-year-old man in Singapore decided to do a live auction for his durians at an interesting venue – Lim Chu Kang cemetery.

> According to Lianhe Wanbao, the seller, known as I-deal Trades on Facebook, had started the livestream at around 9:30pm on Wednesday night (June 17).

> In the Facebook live video, he had 10 durians for sale, which he auctioned off within the hour for a total of S$600.

> People would bid for the durians in the comments section, and the durian would go to the highest bidder.

> So, why Lim Chu Kang cemetery?

> In the livestream, the man said: ""Got people dare me to do live at cemetery, so I accept his dare.""

> In response to comments that he might be ""disturbing"" the rest place of the dead, he said:

> ""I'm not here to disturb the dead, ok? I got full respect for the dead. Before I start my live, I still pray first.""

> Speaking to Wanbao, Xie Qingquan said that he has a day job in the funeral industry, and would do gigs in bars at night.

> However, due to the Covid-19 situation, the bar has shut, prompting him to find alternate streams of income.

> First time selling durian

> Xie said that he usually sells crabs, seafood and other electronics via the livestream. This was the first time he tried selling durians.

> While his livestreams typically get around 100 viewers, this one in particular had garnered close to 1,400 viewers at its peak, Wanbao reported.

> He also told Wanbao that he had expected to sell the durians for a total of S$400.

> Due to the overwhelming response, he was surprised to be able to sell the durians for over S$600 instead.

> According to the I-deal Trades Facebook page, they intend to do another live auction at East Coast on Saturday (June 20).

> All delivery of items are carried out by a courier service.

> Free deliver is provided for bids above S$100.

> Otherwise, a delivery of S$8 applies, I-deal Trades said on Facebook.

> SINGAPORE: A new nature park network covering more than 400ha, triple the size of the existing Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, will be established in the northern part of Singapore, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced on Wednesday (Aug 19).

> The Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network will comprise the Wetland Reserve, the Kranji Marshes, nature parks and eco-corridors, and nature areas such as Jalan Gemala and Kranji Reservoir.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat will also be part of the network and projected to be completed in end 2022.

> The network will be complemented by the upcoming recreational Round-Island-Route, which will connect the various green areas through trails and park connectors.

> Advertisement

> The nature park network will also include a new 18ha Lim Chu Kang Nature Park to the west of the Wetland Reserve, linking it to the Lim Chu Kang mangroves which is expected to be established by early 2022.

> 

> The new nature park, formerly referred to as the Western Extension, will feature outdoor nature-play spaces to encourage children and youths to “spend more time outdoors and reconnect with nature” said NParks in a press release.

> 

> Cashin House, also located in the nature park, will be “enhanced sensitively for both natural and built heritage” and will be used for educational programmes. It will include new facilities such as an exhibition space, seminar rooms for workshops and a seaview terrace.

> NParks will call a tender for works on Cashin House and its surrounding areas shortly, with construction expected to commence in the fourth quarter of this year and will be completed in early 2022, subject to the COVID-19 situation.

> Artist's impression of the terrace at Cashin House, which will be located in the new Lim Chu Kang Nature Park. (Photo: NParks)

> With the new nature park network, more than 15km of nature trails will also be open to the public.

> In a virtual media briefing on Wednesday, NParks' group director of conservation Adrian Loo said: “The Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network will be very important in extending our natural capital in our 'City in Nature' vision.""

> ""The network itself will extend the habitats available for wildlife, importantly for wildlife such as birds that migrate globally and use Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserves as a stopover.""

> “It also allows for our park users and our residents to actually enjoy more parks and be close to nature, without impacting the core areas too much,"" said Dr Loo, adding that the new network will help reduce the visitor pressure to the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and Kranji Marshes, as well as Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat.

> 

> “Especially during the COVID-19 period, people are seeking solace or safe recreation in our parks as we have safe distance measures within these areas,” said Dr Loo.

> 

> Artist's impression of the visitor gallery at Cashin House, which will be located in the new Lim Chu Kang Nature Park. (Photo: NParks)

> Minister for National Development Mr Desmond Lee had announced in March that by 2030, there will be another 200ha of nature parks, which will act as complementary habitats and buffer nature reserves from urbanisation.

> In the press release on Wednesday, NParks said that the decision to safeguard buffer zones and complementary wetland habitats around the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve was determined through “extensive research that established the ecological connectivity and complementarity between the sites”.

> 

> For example, the Wetland Reserve and the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park are important refuelling sites for migratory shorebirds along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway.

> “Wetland habitats also provide a wide variety of goods and services such as serving as a food source and nursery ground for numerous marine organisms, storing carbon and mitigating coastal erosion,” said NParks.

> A total of 279 species of birds have been recorded in the Wetland Reserve and the surrounding complementary habitats, and conserving these “ecologically inter-dependent” areas in the nature park network will enhance the conservation of these birds and the associated ecosystems, it added.
