The British divided Indians into ""martial"" and ""non martial"" groups. The reasoning behind this is very complex and is partially to do with their weird 19th C racial ideas and partially to do with which communities rebelled against them. They directed their Indian Army recruitment policy accordingly. So for example Sikhs were considered a martial race and were heavily recruited for the Indian Army. Other martial races included Rajasthanis, some Bengali castes and so forth. In South India, for various reasons, fewer groups were counted as martial races, and recruitment was therefore much less. South India is and was also less populated than the North. Thus, representation of South Indian groups in the British Indian Army was disproportionately small. 

Interestingly the effect of this is still visible in the modern Indian military where South Indians are less represented in the Army than the Navy and Air Force.",t3_9w17t8,11-11-2018

I know more Hindi than Malayalam though since my parents made me take a lot of weekend classes in Hindi. My Malayalam is limited to understanding certain dialects (I can understand my parents and my grandparents but if I visited a distant relative in India I would struggle) and using some common words. 

I can follow a conversation in Tamil but it's difficult and I have to use contextual clues to understand. To me honestly Tamil sounds cruder because of the more sing-song quality but that might just be because Malayalam also borrows quite a lot from Sanskrit and since I know Hindi, it sounds more familiar to me.

The main problem in Singapore is not the lack of a formalized EIA process, but the  weight these studies usually carry. Regardless of the results, these studies generally have little sway on the decision making process. They are the veritable definition of a box ticking exercise. The process is even less effective in preventing the destruction of secondary forests such as Kranji as they usually have a high abundance of exotics (african tulips, rubber trees, oil palm, etc). This is despite the fact that these secondary regrowth forests can still have exceptionally diverse ecosystems and high biodiversity. 

The only reason the Government is sitting on its hands regarding the Cross Island Line Project is due to popular backlash from groups such as the Nature Society of Singapore (NSS).",t3_llxitu,18-02-2021

As well as MOM guidelines on when to report accidents at the workplace, which results in employers trying to game the system as reported over the years.

Pretty sure whoever is in charge in JTC will go after the contractor's neck if the contractor is solely at fault. Most likely that JTC are covering their oversight so they cannot go hard on the contractor and can only give ""stern warning"".

The aggravating thing about this is the parts similar to the CapitaLand maid case. For some reason, the police authorities were not following due process when they took the maid and evidence into custody. 

In this case, everyone who does govt procurement knows that following proper process is king and everyone is afraid that they will get blacklisted in the gebiz system for not following rules. But I’m afraid that proper processes may not be followed here (such as waiting for EIA, worksite checks on progress etc) and there were lapses in internal controls by the authorities. 

I am half expecting MTI or MSE to say something like the JTC PMO officers were overworked because of covid, busy setting up dormitories etc overwhelmed and that’s why neglected oversight on the contractor. 

These are the only public lapses that we know. Hell, it was some member of public that release the info first. Who knows what other lapses in internal controls happening in our stat boards? 

Especially when the gov are the ONLY protectors of STATE land, they better do a goddamn proper job of it. Not take potshots at nature groups who are trying to do the same thing.

> The former deputy CEO of the Housing Development Board (HDB), Yao Chee Liew, has voiced his discomfort in the apparent shift of responsibility to the contractor for the clearance of a forested area at Kranji.

> Writing in a forum letter in Lianhe Zaobao, Yao said that JTC Corporation was the organisation that developed the project and as such, it should also bear much responsibility for the debacle.

> ""60 per cent of the responsibility lies with JTC""

> Yao said in the letter that both the contractor and JTC were responsible, apportioning 60 per cent of the responsibility to JTC, and 40 per cent to the contractor.

> Yao also said that while some may disagree with his views in terms of how he allocated the responsibility between the two parties, the most important lesson is not to shift the responsibility to the contractor.

> Yao explained that there were procedures which both sides had to adhere to in the course of development.

> These procedures were detailed by Yao to be as such:

> Almost all government projects are carried out by open tender, which means that the contractor would have to make bids based on engineering drawings and contract specifications: The bid is usually won by the contractor with the lowest price,

> Afterwards, JTC would hire a qualified land surveyor to finalise the scope of the project before passing it to the contractor prior to construction, At this point, if the contractor does not develop the project based on the landmarks established by the land surveyor, it is the contractor's fault, In addition, while JTC may be able to state in the contract that the contractor is responsible for surveying the land, but such an approach is irresponsible.

> Both parties must therefore work together to ensure that the project can proceed smoothly. This means JTC has to hire a project manager, engineering supervisor or clerk of works to stay on site which the project is in progress, so as to ensure standards are met and help the contractor with problems that might arise.

> 

> Disbelief that such an incident could happen in Singapore

> After looking at the photos, Yao expressed his disbelief that such an incident could happen in Singapore.

> Moreover, he said that such large-scale logging could not happen possibly happen in a day.

> Yao believes that such large-scale logging would take at least six months to carry out.

> Satellite images showed Kranji woodland destroyed as early as March last year

> Satellite images show that the Kranji woodland was destroyed as early as Mar. 1 last year, from the images and data provided by Global Forest Watch.

> The footage also showed work halted between March and August 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

> The area cleared remained the same throughout those months and more logging was only made starting from September 2020.

> By Jan. 25, 2021, green patches of at least 8 hectares - or 11 football fields - were cleared, according to satellite Sentinel-2B used as part of the European Union's Copernicus Earth-monitoring project.

> Where were JTC's personnel?

> This led Yao to pose the following question: Where did JTC's project manager and engineering supervisor go?

> Yao said that the damage might have been even greater had it not been for the Covid-19 pandemic.

> He concluded by defending contractors in general:

> 'We should know that contractors have made significant contributions to Singapore, especially the old contractors of the Pioneer generation.""

> Contractor under stop work order by JTC

> Yesterday (Feb. 19), Huationg Global Limited said in a press release that it is assisting JTC with investigations into the issue.

> It also said that it had been issued with a stop-work order by JTC on Jan. 13.

> As a result, the Group expects delays in the completion of the project works at the Kranji Agri-Food Innovation Park.

> Background

> A JTC spokesman told the media on Feb. 16 that it discovered its contractor had ""erroneously"" begun clearing some of these specific plots of land prematurely on Jan. 13, 2021.

> That was when JTC ordered all clearing works to stop and issued a stern warning to the contractor.

> Aerial images of the deforestation were posted on social media on Feb. 14, which prompted JTC's response.

> JTC said a Biodiversity Baseline Study was to be carried out in December 2020 to work out an Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan.

> It was to be completed in April 2021 only.

> Development plans were to be discussed with key stakeholders, including nature groups.

> The National Parks Board (NParks) said it was investigating the unauthorised clearance.

> It is illegal to fell a tree with a girth exceeding 1m growing on any vacant land, whether within or outside a tree conservation area, except with the approval of NParks, according to the Parks and Trees Act.

Under normal circumstances, such timelines and deadlines will be made crystal-clear to all parties involved, including the contractor Huationg Global Limited as well as the relevant project managers and supervisors from JTC. 

**However,** what I believe happened was that the long work hiatus due to COVID badly screwed up the schedule and timetable of all parties involved.

> The nature community was shocked by a significant patch of forests being cleared in Kranji after photos showing the clearance was shared online.

> Here's a ""before"" and ""after"" of the forested area:

> Clearance of forested land caught nature community by surprise

> By February, two plots of forests were cleared, leaving only some trees lining on both sides of the rail corridor.

> The Nature Society Singapore said in a Facebook post on Feb. 15 that this is a ""shocking and dreadful development"".

> Nature lover Brice Li said that members of the ""Friends of Rail Corridor"" did not seem to be consulted prior to the clearance.

> ""They had no answers as the development had caught them by surprise too,"" Li said.

> An environment consultant Tony O'Dempsey said that the loss of this area will be potentially detrimental to the rail corridor's ecological sustainability. Therefore, it is important to conduct an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA), he said.

> O'Dempsey added that the Kranji woodlands adjoin the mangrove-lined Sungai Pang Sua canal which is also of ecological importance and it connects the canal to the rail corridor.

> ""We should endeavor to retain these types of habitat connections by incorporating them into development plans. This is how we can bring some heart into our built environment,"" he said.

> JTC: Clearance of forested area was a mistake

> In response to Mothership's queries, JTC Corporation said on Feb. 16 that the agency discovered its contractor had ""erroneously"" begun clearing some of these specific plots of land prematurely on Jan. 13, 2021.

> JTC said that these plots of land were earmarked for the development of the Agri-Food Innovation Park (AFIP) which is part of the Sungei Kadut Eco-District (SKED).

> A Biodiversity Baseline Study and an Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan (EMMP) for specified plots of land within the area were carried out by an environmental specialist engaged by the agency.

> The study and EMMP are expected to be completed around April 2021, following which JTC plans to engage key stakeholders, including nature groups, to discuss its development plans.

> A stern warning has been issued to contractor

> JTC adds that after discovering the land was cleared before the studies were completed, the agency had instructed the contractor to stop all clearing works immediately.

> Since then, no further clearing has taken place on-site and the contractor has been issued a stern warning, JTC said.

> JTC said that the agency takes a very serious view of this incident.

> They will investigate how this error occurred before deciding whether further punitive measures need to be taken.

> JTC said that the baseline study and EMMP will continue and they will work with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), National Parks Board (NParks), and the nature community to ensure the redevelopment plans are carried out with due consultation and in an environmentally responsible and sensitive manners.

> The findings of the studies will also be made public when ready.

> Met up with members from the nature community

> Speaking to Mothership on Feb. 16, Conservation Committee Chair of Nature Society Singapore, Leong Kwok Peng said that the agency had a closed-door meeting with some members of the nature community.

> The agency was ""regretful"" about what had happened and apologised for the clearance.

> Leong said that this is his first time as far as he remembers learning about such oversight by a government agency and hopes the agency will engage the nature community with future updates on the investigation and development plans in the area.

588,24,gnhk95w,t3_ljw2yf,"I’m going to make an unpopular opinion: the Dover forest issue is more bandwagoning than actual concern over the forest.

Look at the first post on r/sg about Dover, it got 900+ upvotes, indicating plenty of interest. It spawned 3 posts about the forest/suggesting alternatives, and 7 posts overall on Dover.

In contrast, Tengah got a miserable 2 posts on its forest. Clementi got 3 about the forest, and that’s all. Can’t find anything else.

The first post on the ecological value of Tengah only got 60 votes, 2 years ago. The petition to save Clementi forest, the oldest post I could find on the topic had only a miserable 130 votes (which is about the same for *all* Clementi forest posts), no where near that of Dover.

Looking at the number of upvotes here, it looks similar to the subsequent posts regarding Dover, basically the “diehards”. Perhaps more interest than the residual Dover posts, given that it is still early. But, overall, little interest appears to be gathered on this tragedy at Kranji, despite the *outpouring* of public support for Dover.

Bandwagoning isn’t necessarily a bad thing. When channelled to good causes, it can be a force of good. The problem is people being led to do more harm than good, asking for preservation of one less significant forest without regards to opportunity costs and how it might threaten other more important ones. 

Many arguments I had over Dover appeared to be very dogmatic. Dogmatic arguments such as apparently Dover is the last home to many endangered wildlife (probably something they got from that Mothership post), and challenging that illogical point resulted only in massive downvoting. Come on, a forest reclaimed by nature in the last 50 years is going to house a dozen endangered species that you can’t find in the nearby Clementi or Bukit Timah nature areas? Where the hell did those wildlife migrate from in the first place? From thin air?

It’s always heartening to see people care about nature. But one must always be aware of bandwagoning. All forests are important, maybe the primary forest are more so, as they are the original home to our wildlife, especially the endangered ones. 

To wildlife, Tengah, Clementi, Dover, Simpang, Ubin, Tekong, and so on, are more or less the same. Reducing the area of forest reduces habitat for wildlife, no matter its location. We can’t build multi-story forest, but we can build densely utilised building that minimises the land footprint. Bandwagoning misses the forest for a tree. Bandwagoning is not interested in discussion on a topic unless it agrees with the popular view. Popular view may not always be right, they can always be co-opted by people with other agenda.

So, when we look at forest, let us view it in a way to maximise the preservation of wildlife. If we can’t don’t cut, don’t. If we have to cut, we want to cut the least. If we truly care about the forest, all of them are important, be it Dover or in Lim Chu Kang.

It would be better for the environment if our efforts are genuine. We care about the environment because we care, not because its popular to care.

And that said, Kranji forest is being enroached. Look at Google Map and you will find that Clementi forest is being cut into two for a canal right now. These are all environmental tragedies that we cannot ignore. These are situations where awareness is needed the most and yet often missing. If anything, the public apathy on those other forests are a worse tragedy than the destruction of those forest itself, especially when people are “self-professed environmentalists” for that popular forest.",t3_ljw2yf,15-02-2021

To put it bluntly - to the trees and animals of any particular forest, the motivations behind conservation are fairly irrelevant. What matters is whether the forest is conserved, or cleared. Trees and animals are not bothered if the conservation was achieved on the basis of genuine concern, or bandwagoning.

On a wider scale as well, whether people support things like emission reductions because they genuinely believe in a principle of conserving the environment, or whether they support the same because it's the next cool thing on instagram, matters little to the climate and/or communities who are at greatest risk of climate change related disasters such as low lying sea side cities. 

The concern about bandwagoning also seems to ignore the reality of society today - bandwagoning is rampant on just about every issue (on both sides of the issue). Hypothesizing a movement entirely untouched by bandwagoning is unrealistic. Movements should account for, and actively take advantage of bandwagoning because that's a great way to get wide support. Getting people to have genuine concerns is a nice *bonus* to have, but if we require movements to only proceed on the basis of genuine concern, then that movement is never going to take off. 

Contextualizing the above back in the Dover Forest issue, if people don't care as much about other forests, the question we should be asking is how do we get people to care (bandwagoning or otherwise) about these other forests, and how we can expand on the existing care and awareness over Dover to the other forests.

That’s where the opportunity costs come in. If we cannot preserve all the forests, then it’s important to evaluate the opportunity costs. It is very unlikely that we can preserve all the forests we have left with right now.

If we blindly support one forest over others without regard for its opportunity cost, ie, jumping on the bandwagon, we might end up causing more harm than good to nature. We can pack 3x more people in Dover than Tengah on a plot of the same area, to preserve Dover would imply we need to clear 3x more land, *if* we have no choice but to develop land.

Right now, because the government and HDB has no clear stance against cutting more forest, it is very reasonable to assume that preserving Dover may come at the expense of other forests. In the short to intermediate term, it is highly unlikely people can force HDB to stop developing forested areas. If people tunnel vision on Dover, we might end up missing the forest for the trees.

We can’t run before we learn how to walk. We can’t talk about saving *all* the forest when we can’t even petition the government to save one. If right now, our options are limited and we could only petition to save one, then, that one forest being saved should be the best option, which I don’t honestly think Dover is. If we jump on the Dover bandwagon, we risk harming a larger amount of forested area, which probably is more harmful to the wildlife, since it represents a greater loss of habitat.

That is the point I am making about the danger of bandwagoning. I already acknowledge that bandwagoning can be good sometimes, and like you said, the wildlife doesn’t care if the concern for them is genuine or fake. 

The problem with bandwagoning is that it is ultimately the act of blindly following what is popular, and the popular view may or may not be the best option out there. It can lead to a situation where people fixate on a poorer option while ignoring other potentially better options.

If we look at the costs and opportunity costs, I really don’t think Dover is the *best* option we have.

A lack of a clear policy on cutting more forests goes both ways - we simply do not know what the Government might be minded to do in the future.

The threat to any forest being on the chopping block is immediate.

>	The wider problem with the reply above is that it is premised on some fairly large assumptions about opportunity costs. In the absence of any clear Government policy on the issue, this is an exercise in speculation.

It is *more than clear* that the government needs land to build housing. It is *more than clear* with affordable housing being something the government always tout as its “track record”. It is also *more than clear* that the government can zone forested areas for housing, which the Dover case clearly indicate.

Thus, it is no exercise in speculation to say that if Dover is preserved, other forest areas might be at risk. Given what has been done, it is only reasonable to presume that it will be done in the future. If we are to stop the government from clearing one plot, it is more than logical to assume they will simply find another plot.

>	It is just as likely that the Government clears both Dover and future forests, or preserving Dover and clearing future forests, or clearing Dover and preserving future forests. If anything, going by planning allocation, it is perhaps even more likely that the Government clears everything that is marked for housing

We know the government do not build excessive housing anymore, and it is more reflective of supply and demand. If we allow Dover to meet this demand, and given that the high density of housing that can be packed on Dover, we buy ourselves a delay in destruction of other forests. 

If we deny using Dover to meet the demand, we hasten the prospect of other forest land being used to meet this demand. Given that Dover represents a very efficient utilisation of land, given the density of housing that can be built there, it’s preservation will only increase the risk of other forested plots of larger area being cleared.

If we can delay the destruction of forest to build relatively inefficient lower density housing, we buy ourselves time to rethink the question of conservation and land use, which obviously takes time.

Right now, it isn’t really a question of *if*, it is a question of *when*. That’s of course lamentable, but if you are the government, there’s really a lot of things to balance and pressures on land use.

Although by saving Dover, people can feel like they do something, it does not mean that it’s failure would result in a total loss. It’s loss will probably delay other patches being placed on the chopping board so quickly (because it satisfies a certain amount of demand). Looking at other forested areas, we know few of them could come close to Dover in terms of housing density, and we risk losing larger areas of wildlife habitats.

Petitioning to save Dover only makes the most sense if the government is unreasonably bulldosing large amount of forest to build ghost towns, as in that case, the government is a lost cause and we have to save what we can. Right now, we could probably trust HDB to be reasonable enough to destroy more or less what is needed, and thus it’s a matter of supply to meet demand.

The long term goal is conservation of all existing forest. The short term goal is to minimise ecological harm from land development. We want to save as many forest as possible. But, ask yourself, can we hope to achieve a total stop to forest destruction within the next 5-10 years? It’s difficult because of the apathy.

Edit: on apathy, my whole initial “unpopular opinion” was on bandwagoning. That people only cared because it is popular, that people talked about conserving Dover because its the talked about topic, while at the same time disregarding other forests. When the Dover forest development first break the news, we got over 900 votes. In contrast, OP is now putting the destruction of Kranji forest on the radar, and it’s interest is fractional. We can’t talk about forcing the government to change its stance when people are still this apathetic. We are on reddit, the progressive echo chamber. One must imagine how much worse it would be outside of reddit.

Edit 2: make it clear, I want to point out the need for efficient land use. Why build 10-story blocks that needs more land to house as many people? Let’s build 40-50 stories high HDB. HDB needs to work with LTA/MOT more than before and come up with a multi-ministry development plans, with good infrastructure to support dense housing. Tengah is on the right track, but the west is being bottlenecked so there’s so much you can pack there. Also, HDB should work with CAAS on that height restriction thing, to maximise areas that can support huge tall HDBs. With dense housing, we will need less land, and less pressure to demolish forests.",t3_ljw2yf,15-02-2021

637,24,gni6k2g,t1_gni1zkj,"1. Your three ""*more than clear""* points merely establishes the historical trend of the Government to prioritize affordable housing over conservation of forests. It tells us nothing about the effect of conserving Dover. Indeed, if the historical trend holds true, the Government is simply going to cut down Dover as well as the other forests.

1A) In fact, if we approached this from a planning perspective, all the other forests already marked for housing or other planning purposes are *already at risk* and this would not change whatever the outcome at Dover, unless the planning designation changes (which requires events and societal pressure independent of what happens at Dover).

2) New housing is not a zero sum exchange between clearing forests and new housing developments. That's a false dichotomy which people that are seeking to conserve Dover are going to expressly reject. No one is saying ""don't clear this forest clear *that other one*"". Instead people are coming up with various ideas (of varying merit) about how other areas can be repurposed or intensified.

3) We've currently cleared a large majority of forests in Singapore (90%? Edit - sadly I have to correct this figure to 99% - [https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/research/publications/gardens-bulletin-singapore/-/media/sbg/gardens-bulletin/gbs\_63\_01,-a-,02\_y2011\_v63\_01,-a-,02/63\_01,-a-,02\_205\_y2011\_v63p1,-a-,p2\_gbs\_pg\_205.pdf](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/research/publications/gardens-bulletin-singapore/-/media/sbg/gardens-bulletin/gbs_63_01,-a-,02_y2011_v63_01,-a-,02/63_01,-a-,02_205_y2011_v63p1,-a-,p2_gbs_pg_205.pdf)) and are in the middle of an era of climate change that is scheduled to create all sorts of immediate problems including rising sea levels. The Government has also explicitly gone out on a limb to set up a Green Plan and other climate change incentives. Given this context, I am not sure why we need to wait for the Government to embark on building ghost towns. The Government has recognized the wider environmental issues and on that basis there is plenty of basis for people to petition for *all* remaining forests to be saved, including Dover.

The above can really be rephrased as a question - what benefits do we get by not petitioning for the preservation of Dover versus what benefits we get for petitioning for Dover *and getting the same people involved in petitioning for other forests as well*? Unless I am missing something, doing nothing ensures the status quo of apathy and forest clearing. Petitioning on the other hand, even if unsuccessful, provides chances for better outcomes (Dover is preserved, the other forests are preserved, both are preserved, and/or increased grassroots support for environmental issues).

>Edit: on apathy, my whole initial “unpopular opinion” was on bandwagoning. That people only cared because it is popular, that people talked about conserving Dover because its the talked about topic, while at the same time disregarding other forests. When the Dover forest development first break the news, we got over 900 votes. In contrast, OP is now putting the destruction of Kranji forest on the radar, and it’s interest is fractional. We can’t talk about forcing the government to change its stance when people are still this apathetic. We are on reddit, the progressive echo chamber. One must imagine how much worse it would be outside of reddit.

Bandwagoning is not apathy. An truly apathetic populace would ironically be highly immune to bandwagoning. In this context, bandwagoning is actually a positive development - it shows that people can care, even if it is merely on a superficial level.",t3_ljw2yf,15-02-2021
638,24,gni7dbr,t1_gni6k2g,"I want to say that I agree with you that petitioning of Dover raise awareness of threats to wildlife habitat. That isn’t in doubt.

One could hope Dover could drive people to rethink the status quo on conversation, and indeed, the Dover issue had spawned so many follow up posts on forests. Sadly, I don’t think the interest remains and what interest was gathered for Dover mostly remained only for Dover.

There’s no point arguing about the merits of demolishing Dover or preserving it. We both have different views and let’s agree to disagree. That being said, it’s a good thing a forest is preserved. While in my opinion it isn’t the best, some interest is better than none, I guess?

Maybe the strengths of Dover doesn’t really lie in its ecological value, but lies in the psychological value. Perhaps Dover will rally interest and save forests in the long term, even if the worse case scenario happens and the government simply find another forested plot to demolish in the short run.",t3_ljw2yf,15-02-2021
639,24,gni9mba,t1_gni7dbr,"The Dover issue has spawned, just for example, this thread where people are talking about a patch of forest in Kranji which probably did not even exist for some people yesterday. The interest is modest compared to Dover, but this thread in likelihood would not even be here if Dover was not a popular topic of discussion.

Indeed, if the Dover petition results in comments like ""*hang on there are all these other forests that are at risk*"", then all the better. Dover itself is simply a continuation of a growing trend of environmental issues being raised more often and publicly. We can fit Dover in the same line of growth with other events like the cross island line environmental debate, the wildlife connectors over the express ways, the new Green Plan from the government, and so on.

In fact, I could raise your Dover with what is perhaps an even *more* bandwagony example. Otters have gone from basically being non-existent (or viewed as pests) to a sort of national icon in large part due to social media and looking cute. People at large don't exactly support the otters out of proper environmental concerns, but more so because they look cute on instagram and also because they live far away enough from the otter grounds and so don't have to deal with otters occasionally coming in to wipe out their private fishing pools.

As vapid as one might consider the otter support to be, it has in the longer run had the benefit of getting people to care a lot more about things like pollution in our water ways, the endangered status of the otters, living with wildlife in an urban environment, and even the design of our parks and green spaces.",t3_ljw2yf,15-02-2021

Also if using google maps it can be seen that the area in 2009 was pretty empty, with the forest gradually developing into what we see as the pre-cleared view, after Kranji Rd was widened.

Not saying that the unauthorised clearing isn't a serious incident, but I'm just amazed that it wasn't actually a forested area a decade back. 

What we take for granted was painstakingly developed (by nature), and cleared in a fraction of the time it took to grow, due to mistakes.

Multiple patches of remaining forests in the north has already been cleared through the years, leaving us with an even bigger concrete jungle:

1. Small patch between Woodlands Crescent and Gambas Ave
2. Along Gambas Ave towards Sembawang Rd 
3. Opp Canberra MRT stn (where Canberra town is now)
4. Behind RP where the TEL Woodlands North stn is now
5. Woodlands North Coast (around Senoko fishery port)
6. Kranji Woodland

Tbh, I'm not sure what to feel about the amount of development that has caused these forests to disappear, and seeing the greenery and even bald fields that I used to enjoy turning into tall industrial buildings and flats has made me nostalgic, and can only hope that the remaining forests that still exist can be seriously evaluated before any development plans come by like the bulldozers.",t3_lmkpec,18-02-2021

> Indian national Chinnaiah Karthik, 21, allegedly approached the 23-year-old student along Turf Club Avenue at around 1.30am on May 4, Chinese daily Lianhe Wanbao reported.

> The student reportedly attempted to defend herself but was overpowered by the man, who retaliated by attacking her.

> He then dragged her into a nearby forested area between the Singapore Turf Club and Kranji War Memorial, where he raped her, according to the report and court documents.

> It is not clear whether the student was jogging or walking home at the time of the incident, or whether the attack was premeditated.

> Following police investigations, Chinnaiah was identified through surveillance footage recorded in the area, including from a camera attached to a nearby lamp post.

> He was arrested the next day near his dormitory during a police ambush, according to Lianhe Wanbao, which added that Chinnaiah is currently being remanded and investigations are ongoing.

> Chinnaiah was charged in court on May 7 and his case is expected to be heard on June 3 in the High Court.

> If convicted of the serious sexual offence, he could face a jail sentence of between eight and 20 years, and at least 12 strokes of the cane.

> SINGAPORE - Large swathes of Kranji Woodland along the rail corridor were mistakenly cleared while the authorities were in the midst of biodiversity impact assessments there.

> Aerial photos of the site showing the destruction of the woodland, a 70ha green patch that is home to around 40 species of birds, emerged on social media on Sunday (Feb 14). One picture showed a narrow strip of trees surrounding the rail corridor, with much of the rest cleared.

> In response to these posts, a JTC Corporation spokesman said on Tuesday that the land was ""erroneously"" cleared by its contractor before the completion of environmental assessments.

> The National Parks Board told The Straits Times that it is investigating the unauthorised clearance at the site.

> ""We take a serious view of unauthorised greenery clearance and will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement action,"" it added.

> Development projects in Singapore near sensitive nature areas are subject to greater scrutiny and developers may be required to carry out more detailed environmental studies.

> The green patches cleared were on a site slated for the Agri-Food Innovation Park, which is part of the Sungei Kadut Eco-District (Sked). The master plan for the latter, which seeks to support new growth sectors such as agri-tech and environmental technology, was announced in February last year.

> Upon discovering the mistake during a site inspection on Jan 13, JTC instructed the contractor Huationg to stop all clearing works immediately.

> 

> The green patches cleared were on a site slated for the Agri-Food Innovation Park. PHOTO: BRICE LI/FACEBOOK

> 

> No further clearing has taken place at the site since then and the contractor has been issued a stern warning, JTC said.

> According to the statutory board, it had engaged an environmental specialist to conduct a biodiversity baseline study last December to create an environmental monitoring and management plan (EMMP) for specified plots of land within the area. These were expected to be completed around April before plans to engage stakeholders.

> ""JTC will continue with the baseline study and EMMP and will work closely with all relevant stakeholders... to ensure that the Sked redevelopment plans are carried out with due consultation and in an environmentally responsible and sensitive manner,"" the spokesman said.

> 

> One picture showed a narrow strip of trees surrounding the rail corridor, with much of the rest cleared. PHOTO: BRICE LI/FACEBOOK

> 

> ""The findings of the studies will be publicly available when ready.""

> In a statement, Huationg apologised and said it was working with JTC on ongoing investigations ""to determine the cause of this lapse, and to prevent future occurrences"".

> ""We are also reviewing internally and working with JTC to strengthen our project management processes,"" the contractor added.

> SINGAPORE: JTC Corporation said on Monday (Feb 22) it accepts its “supervisory responsibilities” in the case of a Kranji woodland site that was partially cleared by mistake, adding that it is conducting an internal review of its processes to see what could have led to the error.

> The agency said last Tuesday that plots of land had been “erroneously cleared” by a contractor before a commissioned environmental study could be completed, prompting criticism from nature groups and conservation advocates.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The area is where the Agri-Food Innovation Park will be developed. It is located along a green artery known as the Rail Corridor.

> At a media conference on Monday, JTC said that the site to be developed measures 25ha, of which 11.9ha has been cleared, while 13.1ha of greenery remains.

> 

> Specifically, based on preliminary findings, the land that was erroneously cleared measured about 4.5ha, or the equivalent of about six football fields.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> JTC Corp’s CEO Tan Boon Khai said an overall investigation is being conducted into how the land was cleared by mistake, with the full cooperation of parties involved in developing the site.

> “Regardless, as the project site developer, JTC does have overall responsibility for the site. We do not run away from this responsibility. We will not, nor do we intend to,” said Mr Tan.

> “JTC is now undertaking an internal review of some of its internal processes and procedures to look at whether there are any shortcomings that could have resulted in some of these issues happening on the ground,” he added.

> “And when that review is completed, we will certainly be looking at how we can improve. We do strive to do better. We acknowledge that we can do better, and we must.”

> Advertisement

> LAND WAS MOSTLY SCRUBLAND

> The site, which was home to part of the former KTM railway line, did not require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as it was “not close to any sensitive nature areas”, said JTC.

> Most of the site comprised “disused scrubland” with a few scattered large trees, most of which were Albizia trees, it noted.

> JTC added that the land is now dominated by non-native Albizia regrowth. The trees had sprouted over time, after the railway service stopped and the land was returned to Singapore in 2011.

> Giving a timeline of developments, JTC said that although an EIA was not needed, a flora baseline study was completed in July 2019.

> A further fauna baseline survey, as well as an Environmental Monitoring and Management Programme (EMMP), were later required in August 2020.

> This was because a new drain, proposed as part of the building plan, would release discharge into Sungei Pang Sua, creating a potential risk of pollution caused by sediment runoff.

> May 2, 2019: CPG Consultants (CPG) engaged to carry out planning and design works

> Jul 22, 2019: CPG submitted Building Plan for tree felling to NParks with a tree survey plan

> Jul 29, 2019: CPG completed flora baseline study

> Aug 29, 2019: NParks issued a Written Direction to approve CPG’s urgent request for tree felling in plots 4, 5 and 9

> Mar 2, 2020: With this approval, clearance started for plot 9

> Satellite images depicting the progress of clearance from February to March 2020. (Photo: JTC Corp)

> Aug 21, 2020: CPG’s resubmission of a Building Plan showed a new proposed drain that would discharge into Sungei Pang Sua. NParks then required a fauna baseline study and EMMP

> August to September 2020: Site clearance continued for plot 8, 10-1, 10-7 and road 2, while the fauna baseline study was being called

> Sep 29, 2020: NParks issued Building Plan clearance for tree felling, subject to conditions of the fauna study and EMMP

> Nov 3, 2020: CPG asked NParks for permission to clear more plots. It only approved the partial clearance of plot 1 on Nov 6, and the plot was cleared.

> Dec 15, 2020: Plots 4 and 5 started being cleared based on the approval from August 2019

> Satellite images depicting the clearance of various plots from November to December 2020. (Photo: JTC Corp, Planetscope)

> 23 Dec, 2020: The fauna baseline study and EMMP consultant was engaged

> End-Dec 2020 to Jan 13, 2021: Contractor cleared further areas, measuring 4.5ha (in red)

> Satellite image depicting the state of the plot in January 2021. (Photo: JTC Corp)

> Jan 13, 2021: JTC’s project manager discovered the further clearing. All clearance works suspended and JTC started an internal investigation

> Jan 15, 2021: Stern warning issued to contractor. Investigations still under way

> Feb 16, 2021: JTC released media statement and contractor apologised

> WHAT NOW?

> All work on site continue to be suspended, JTC said.

> It added that the fauna baseline study and EMMP are estimated to be completed in April 2021.

> Thereafter, JTC said it will engage stakeholders on the study’s findings. The results of the study will also be publicly shared.

> Separately, NParks is conducting investigations to see if there were breaches of the Parks and Trees Act and Wildlife Act.

> Commissioner of Parks and Recreation at NParks, Dr Leong Chee Chiew, stressed that assumptions should not be made ahead of this because penalties under these laws are “not small”, with fines of up to S$50,000 and even the possibility of six months’ imprisonment.

> Aside from investigations by JTC and NParks, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing and National Development Minister Desmond Lee have also ordered a review on inter-agency coordination.

The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve (Chinese: 双溪布洛湿地保护区, Malay: Kawasan Simpanan Alam Semulajadi Sungei Buloh) is a nature reserve in the northwest area of Singapore. It is the first wetlands reserve to be gazetted in Singapore (2002), and its global importance as a stop-over point for migratory birds was recognised by the inclusion of the reserve into the East Asian Australasian Shorebird Site Network. The reserve, with an area of 130 hectares, was listed as an ASEAN Heritage Park in 2003.

So whether it's repeated or not that's 10 times more than Singapore's 2,000 people per day. What's the cause of the difference? And what does it mean - that Singapore has a narrow criteria for testing and hence numbers are inaccurate?

The more impartial way would be an in depth comparison such as using similar testing standards, which unfortunately isn’t present as a [unified standard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing) .As methods vary, I would think the tolerance of error varies too.

There is also the debate on how the testing is conducted - on demand like in Daegu (anyone can seek for a test) or by risk (subjective to each Govt) like in Singapore. And the varying testing capacity of each country/ city also differs.

Laboratory testing for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection. 

The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus'  RNA. This test is specific and is designed to only detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.

Detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and population surveillance.

> SINGAPORE: Four Singaporeans have been arrested after the authorities seized a drone carrying drugs at Kranji Reservoir Park, said the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) in a joint news release on Saturday (Jun 20).

> According to the release, the police detected ""unusual unmanned aircraft activity"" in the vicinity of the park at about 5.45pm on Wednesday.

> Advertisement

> Officers from the Woodlands Police Division were dispatched to investigate and they observed a drone, with a bag attached to it, hovering in the air.

> 

> The police subsequently found and arrested two men, aged 29 and 34, believed to be operating the drone. The drone and a black bag attached to it were retrieved.

> 

> Investigations showed the bag contained substances suspected to be controlled drugs - about 278g of Ice. CNB officers searched one of the men's car parked in the area and found an assortment of controlled drugs - about 35g of Ice, 8g of heroin and 195 Ecstasy tablets.

> ""The two men were suspected to have operated the unmanned aircraft from Singapore, to import drugs from Malaysia. The flight data retrieved from one of the suspects' phone showed that the unmanned aircraft had flown from Kranji to Johor Bahru and back again to Kranji that day,"" the release stated.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Both men were charged on Friday with trafficking Class A controlled drugs.

> TWO MORE ARRESTED

> A follow-up operation on Jun 18 led to the arrest of another man and a woman. The 24-year-old woman, a suspected drug abuser, was arrested in the vicinity of a private housing estate at Marne Road. The 40-year-old man, a suspected drug abuser, was arrested shortly after in a unit within the housing estate.

> As the man ""refused to heed the lawful orders of the CNB officers to open the door"", forced entry was effected, the release said. A total of about 76g of Ice, a small amount of heroin, two Erimin-5 tablets and cash amounting to S$13,230 were found in the unit.

> Cash and some of the drugs seized by the Central Narcotics Bureau on Jun 18, 2020 in the vicinity of Marne Road. (Photo: CNB)

> The total value of the drugs seized in both operations is estimated to be at least S$44,000.

> The 389g of Ice seized in total is enough to feed the addiction of about 220 drug abusers for one week, the authorities said.

> Investigations are ongoing.

> 

> One of the new cases is imported and the remaining cases are locally transmitted. Twenty-four more patients have been discharged, taking the total number of people who have fully recovered to 344.

> Among the local cases, MOH has established links to existing clusters for 35 cases. Of these, 24 are linked to clusters at foreign dormitories and 11 are linked to non-dormitory clusters.

> A total of 30 of the new cases are unlinked, and contact tracing is ongoing for these patients.

> 

> A total of 571 patients are still in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, and 25 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Two new clusters were also identified, according to the Ministry. They are Little Gems Preschool and Kranji Lodge.

>

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that Singapore has been conducting around 2,000 coronavirus tests daily. As of Monday, the country has conducted more than 65,000 tests.

> He provided these numbers in a written answer on Monday to a parliamentary question by Nominated Member of Parliament Walter Theseira.

> Assoc Prof Theseira had also asked if the Ministry of health will report any other national health statistics relating to COVID-19 to enable researchers to gather ""internationally comparable datasets"" on the pandemic.

> ""The Ministry of Health reports the relevant COVID-19 information and statistics regularly to keep Singaporeans updated. We also share information on the number of tests conducted from time to time where relevant,"" said Mr Gan in his reply.

> 

> THIRD SUPPORT PACKAGE TO SUPPORT SINGAPORE

> As part of the country's ongoing battle against COVID-19, a third support package announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Monday.

> The S$5.1 billion Solidarity Budget is aimed at saving jobs and protecting livelihoods during the four weeks when schools and non-essential businesses have to be shut as part of the “circuit breaker” distancing measures that will kick in from Tuesday.

> From Tuesday, most workplaces islandwide will be closed and schools will move to full home-based learning, as announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last week. Only essential services like food establishments, markets and supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utilities, transport and key banking services will remain open.

> Mr Heng said on Monday the COVID-19 pandemic had ""exploded"" in Singapore in recent days. To date, Singapore has seen six COVID-19 fatalities.

> Singapore has “progressively” ramped up its measures but as the number of infections – especially local transmitted cases – kept rising in recent days, the Government decided to roll out an “extraordinary” set of “circuit breaker” measures to pre-empt the escalation, he said.

> 

> This is the first time that the Singapore Government has released three Budgets in less than two months, following the S$6.4 billion Unity Budget in February and the record-breaking S$48 billion Resilience Budget on Mar 26.

> To fund this third booster, the Government has sought permission from President Halimah Yacob to draw an additional S$4 billion from past reserves, on top of the S$17 billion tapped for the Resilience Budget.

> Altogether, Singapore will be committing S$59.9 billion, or about 12 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), for this battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.

First Phase: Modified BMT

They will send you another packing list when you’re nearer the enlistment date. If you’re stayout, the things on the packing list should be enough. If stay in and you like your laundry neat, bring about 4-6 hangers and Febreze. Because you will be swapping between outfits rather often.

Eg. Long 4 -> PT Kit -> Smart 4

Alot of us like to have a folded Smart 4 ready so we don’t need to fold again when we need it, hence the need for hangers.

Oh and you can bring your favourite toiletries if you prefer. For me it was comfortable for me to use my own Dettol body soap during BMT. I personally probably didn’t use the soap they provided at all but your preference is most important :)

You most likely will know if you’re stay in or stayout only on the first few days of enlisting so be prepared to stay in a couple of days or even the whole duration of the BMT. If you already know you’re staying out, then that’s great :D

Second Phase: Vocational Training

There will be this Friday where everyone assembles at the driveway and you are all assigned to your respective vocations. You either remain in camp or travel on chartered buses to your new location depending on vocation.

I can only speak for the ASA (Clerk) course because I am one. If you’re posted to be trained as an ASA or SA(GE) (Storeman) then its lessons everyday for you in aircon room :) Just enjoy yourself!

I’m not so sure about the other vocations but the feedback seems not bad as well.

Do enjoy the company with your fellow enlistees! At times you may sweat abit more, other times you are in bunk resting so don’t worry too much :D",t3_arvnaf,18-02-2019

Do you just wash and dry every single day? And I'm not sure how many civilian clothes and all that I need to bring haha.

How's ASA btw? I've heard it's slack and you don't do much but in your free time what are you even allowed to do? Can you bring books, use phone, play instruments?

Oh and how much do you think I should train? I'm overweight but how bad would the training be? I'm also PES C9. I actually thought I could lose weight during NS but since people say they're very strict about safety I don't know if it's possible now..like you can't run etc",t3_arvnaf,18-02-2019

1091,24,egq5krv,t1_egq480l,"I got 3 sets of No 4, not to worry. People either wash and dry (dries overnight, there's a laundry area in the dorms) or leave for a few days and wash. Civilian clothes as far as I know you only need one set and only in the first week. Will not be required following that. 

Currently doing ASA course now and honestly it's really really slack with lots of admin time. Phone is allowed in bunk, books and instruments are fine to my knowledge. Basically anything goes but computers as far as I know, and they rarely do bag checks anyway. 

Training will probably be up to you. Don't expect to lose much weight here unless you train on your own accord (either in bunk or ask for permission to do PT during admin time). The PT they give is fairly limited and they're very safety minded so you may not lose much weight at all unless you are disciplined (and don't take so much from the cookhouse because they tend to dump a lot of food).

Good to know about instruments being allowed...would you know anything about whether you can bring amplifiers for electric guitar? I guess there's no wall plugs but if it was battery operated and you used headphones do you think that would be fine?

You can’t pick your vocation and the vocation you receive is based on numerous things which is not revealed. That being said, PES Status is one of the items that plays a huge role in the vocation you receive.

Uniforms you get on enlistment, you pretty much don't need to bring anything other than hangers and whatever they write there. Washing is done by hand so bring detergent/washing powder. 

No clue about amps. I think if you asked they may consider but it may be a bit bulky to bring back and forth so it may not be allowed. At one point I was considering bringing a digital keyboard (piano) but decided against it in the end.

1120,24,egs5pv2,t1_egs1jrl,"The uniforms are fit to you most of the time from when you went to CMPB for medical checkup so don't worry about that. If any of your equipment doesn't fit (helmet, ilbv, boots, shoes, shirts/pants) you can still go down and change the size while the vendors are in camp. 

I've never seen anyone get caught for the plugs but honestly the sergeants are so chill they may just ask you to keep it and give you a warning. 

No way to know I think, though usually Alpha company comes in one day earlier than Bravo, so if you have any friends who are a day earlier or later than you you can probably guess. ",t3_arvnaf,19-02-2019

2. They ask you how you’re doing, check with you any external issues which SAF can render assistance, or any concerns you might have with BMT.

1196,24,eap8wmz,t1_eakrt52,"I’ll try to answer as much as I can. :)

1. Routinely-wise, there’s no paperwork for the first month, it’s basic military training like Swimming, marching and then you have your high key events being grenade throwing, to be honest, if you’re looking for Xiong PT, school V’s routine for BMT is a really watered down version of Tekong’s BMT for you. There’s exercise but you might find it too easy because you have to take in mind that School V is a mix of Pes C and Pes E, so there might be some others who might not be able to take in that level of exercise, but then the one in school V is quite alright for everyone, quite enjoyable IMO. It feels quite like a school camp haha.

For the second month, depending on your vocation there’s lessons that you have to attend pertaining to your vocation that you’re assigned to. For example, I’m a Supply assistant which in layman’s term - a storeman. All the vocations in school V belong under the support role. Meaning that whatever the Choong sua army guys need, you provide them in times of war, if you can provide, the Army is able to fight. However, you might have heard that being in support is quite relax and lepak, but I can say that it’s not entirely true, there’s a mental fortitude one must have to provide for your army guys especially if you have to go to outfield. I just had mine yesterday and we’re the first batch of Pes Cs to have outfield, usually it’s for Pes B and As.

2. Uhhh usually a 20k to 30k maH powerbank is enough and as for hangers and whatnot, there’s a list that they will receive in your letter and it’s more than sufficient. Do bring detergent powder :)

3. Uhhhh try to wake up on time and Fall in on time as not falling in on time, they won’t make you do push ups and stuff uh, more like scold the platoon. But if you’re really worried about time discipline, I strongly recommend getting a physical alarm clock, it helps a lot!

>Railway service ceased in 2011 before Singapore took over and earmarked  it for future redevelopment into an Agri-Food Innovation Park.   
Based on satellite images, a would-be forest begin to form only in late-2012 to mid-2013.   
In fact, the barren land at Kranji Woodland completely regenerated into a forest within 7 to 8 years.   
An 'accidental forest' is still an important habitat for wildlife 

I am curious about the Falcataria moluccana (Albizia) tree though. 7-8 years is quite a short time for a sapling to grow into a tree and it could be useful for rapid reforestation of this area again. However, the article mentions it is an invasive species. Is this correct? How does NParks deal with cases of forests populated by invasive trees? Do they just let it be or do they weed out the invasive species?

Now that the deforestation has happened, it seems like a good idea to replant the area with non-invasive flora.",t3_lpjuap,22-02-2021

1349,24,goch8hf,t1_gobqpt3,"Yes, Albizia is not a native species in this part of Southeast Asia. However, it's still seen as potentially useful - because it's typically one of the tallest trees in these woodland areas, birds of prey often nest in its crown. Holes and cavities form easily in the trunks and branches, creating potential nest sites for birds like woodpeckers, kingfishers, and parakeets. Various bees and wasps may also nest in such holes. It's one of the potential host plants for the caterpillars of some of our butterflies and moths. The critically endangered Raffles' Banded Langur has also been seen feeding on the leaves of the Albizia.

The same applies for a variety of other non-native plant that have become established here. They're not supposed to be in Singapore, but they've become a part of our ecosystems. Like it or not, they're here to stay, and while we need to make sure that they don't invade the nature reserves and harm threatened species, by and large they're allowed to remain as long as they don't become too weedy and start outgrowing the natives, especially within the nature reserves.

NParks does clear some non-native plants in areas marked for reforestation, and actively removes some of the invasive climbers (Zanzibar Yam is especially bad), but clearing non-native trees from our nature reserves and nature parks can be difficult and expensive because of logistics (no way to bring heavy equipment into areas without roads), and also the need to set up cordons and make sure people keep a safe distance. Not to mention that if you chop down a non-native tree, you might end up inadvertently harming a whole bunch of native plant and animal species in the immediate vicinity when it falls.

The main issue with Albizia is that it's very prone to breaking, which is why it's been removed from many areas, especially along roadsides and trails in parks due to the potential threat to human safety and property.",t3_lpjuap,22-02-2021
