I've come up with a list of headlines for things that the Bull could be doing. Feel free to add on.

Bull heads to Changi Airport Jewel, together with rest of Singapore, to try A&W.

Bull joins former A-G Walter Woon on Lee Suet Fern's defence team.

Bull starts new brown sugar milk tea store using its own milk, draws rave reviews and hour long queues.

Seeing that the current spate of opposition politicians includes Lim Tean and Tan Kin Lian, Bull announces run for Parliament.

Bull goes to Hong Lim to organise protest. Protest is called the Cow Peh Cow Bull."
