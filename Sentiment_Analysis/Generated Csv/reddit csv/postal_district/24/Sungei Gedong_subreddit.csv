2,24,Genuine question: How do I get out of Sungei Gedong Camp?,54,ddmjhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ddmjhx/genuine_question_how_do_i_get_out_of_sungei/,51,05-10-2019,"I have an ICT in Sungei Gedong coming up.  From what I remember, thereâ€™s no issue booking a cab to get in, but the trouble comes when I need to get out.  No taxi/PHV wants to drive in for a booking.

The 975 bus takes forever.

Are there any new forms of outgoing transport now?  Like maybe a private bus or something going to a MRT station.

Thanks."
