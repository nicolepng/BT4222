Both locations have MRT access: Punggol coast MRT (terminus of north-east line) and Tengah plantation MRT (Jurong region line)

Tengah is a new town which will be fully developed in about 20 years? So at the beginning, there will not be as many amenities.
Kinda like the idea of it being filled with greenery and there will be a car lite town centre. Sounds and look interesting based on artist illustration. Is it worth the wait for Tengah to be fully developed?

Although the first flats to be built in Tengah is quite a distance from the town centre, there will be an mrt line heading towards there. 

Punggol coast on the other hand is located near coney island. It has a direct train down towards town/harbourfront. 
It also has a shorter waiting time of 2.5 years. Tengah may take around 3-4 years.

Punggol coast seems to be a good choice as it has a shorter waiting time and easy access to town. Tengah is an interesting town but I’m not sure how well will it go in the future (in terms of value too).

Would appreciate some input!
Thank you!

18,24,OOT; Posted to Tengah Air Base as Driver,0,bdpl5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bdpl5p/oot_posted_to_tengah_air_base_as_driver/,44,16-04-2019,"Hi, as what the title suggests, I just received my posting orders to Tengah Air Base as a Driver. Having a few mixed feelings about it as I’m afraid of driving and Tengah being very far from my home but I’ll try my best to give it a go! Since I’ve been given this posting, I’ve a few questions to ask 

(Note that I’m still in Tekong today but have to get to Tengah by tomorrow)

1) Reporting time is always 8am right? Since Tengah Air Base is rather big, where do I report to exactly? 

2) How is it like to be a driver in Tengah? Would it be rigorous? 

3) Is there possibly a higher chance for recourse for Drivers compared to other vocations like a storeman or ASA? 

4) How long is the driving course? What happens after that? 

5) There’s no way to request for a change of camp or change to ASA/storeman at all right, even if you’re afraid to drive? 

6) Is Tengah a Red or Green Zone? How’s the food and everything like over there?

7) Is it possible to take leave? After driver’s course?

I know my queries can be bs but I just wish to know as much as I can, many thanks in advance!"
