> SINGAPORE: If he still depended on living in his late father Lee Kuan Yew’s home at 38 Oxley Road to “exude a magic aura and impress the population”, both he and Singapore would be in a “very sad state”, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday (Dec 1).

> He made this comment in courtroom evidence as part of a lengthy back-and-forth with lawyer Lim Tean over whether he had misled his father into thinking that the house would be gazetted as a heritage property.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The Oxley Road property has taken centre stage in a defamation lawsuit that PM Lee filed against Mr Lim’s client - socio-political website The Online Citizen’s (TOC) chief editor Terry Xu.

> The lawsuit went to trial in the High Court on Monday. It continued on Tuesday in a courtroom filled to capacity with onlookers, subject to safe distancing measures, as Mr Lim cross-examined PM Lee.

> The Prime Minister is suing Mr Xu for alleged libel over an article published on TOC in August last year. The article was titled “PM Lee’s wife Ho Ching weirdly shares article on cutting ties with family members”.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Since 2017, PM Lee has been embroiled in a dispute with his siblings - Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang - over the fate of their family home at 38 Oxley Road after the death of their father, who was Singapore’s founding prime minister.

> The TOC article, PM Lee’s lawyers have said, contains false allegations repeated from his siblings that gravely injure his character and reputation.

> ""POLITICALLY UNTENABLE""

> During a three-hour hearing on Tuesday morning, PM Lee reiterated his stance on 38 Oxley Road - that it was “politically untenable” for him to profit from redeveloping it.

> Advertisement

> If he wanted to carry out his father’s wishes and do this, he “would do ill to Singapore”, he said.

> PM Lee had previously explained that he had recused himself from the Government’s handling of the property and sold the property to his brother.

> Part of his case for defamation is that those who read the TOC article would think that PM Lee misled his father into thinking that the Government would gazette the house and that it was futile for the late Mr Lee to maintain his position that it should be demolished.

> The house has never been gazetted.

> On the other hand, Mr Xu’s case is that between Dec 27 in 2011, when Mr Lee wrote to the Cabinet about the house, and Sept 6 in 2012, when he said in an email that it had been gazetted as a heritage house, he had been misled into thinking it had been gazetted.

> Mr Lee thus removed the demolition clause in his fifth will in October 2012, Mr Xu argues.

> Mr Lee had signed six wills over 15 months between August 2011 and November 2012. He signed a final one, with the demolition clause re-inserted, in December 2013.

> NO FREEDOM OF ACTION

> Earlier, PM Lee testified that many members of the public, newspaper editors, as well as members of the Cabinet wanted the house to be preserved. Mr Lee wanted it demolished.

> On Tuesday, in a bid to establish the proposition that the late Mr Lee thought the house would be gazetted, Mr Lim took PM Lee through numerous emails between him, his father, Madam Ho and his siblings.

> On Aug 11, 2011, Dr Lee had responded to an email from their father. She said that she would prefer to continue living at the Oxley Road property but that he “called the shots”.

> The late Mr Lee replied: “I cannot call the shots. Loong as PM has the final word.”

> In another email shortly after, he also said: “Even if I knock it down while I’m alive, the PM can gazette it as a heritage site and stop the demolition.”

> Mr Lim told PM Lee in court: “The reality of the matter is that you as PM, the most powerful person in Singapore politically - you had the final word. Not editors, not the Cabinet, the public.”

> PM Lee replied: “That’s what my father said, but I explained to him what I would do if I were the decision maker. In other words, I really did not have freedom of action.”

> ""SINGAPOREANS KNOW ME""

> Mr Lim then suggested that Mr Lee was “distraught” after meeting the Cabinet in July 2011. PM Lee replied: “That is wrong.”

> The lawyer also suggested that it was “convenient” for PM Lee to say there was pressure from others to preserve the house when his father knew that he, PM Lee, called the shots.

> “I reject that totally and I have explained why,” the Prime Minister responded.

> “Your siblings are correct when they said you wanted to keep the house to inherit Lee Kuan Yew’s credibility?” the lawyer asked. PM Lee said he thought this was “rubbish”.

> Mr Lim then asked: “The PM residing at Oxley, will it remind the public of your father?”

> ""Maybe for better, maybe for worse,” PM Lee replied.

> “Are you saying that Singaporeans have a terrible impression of your father?” the lawyer asked.

> “I’m saying that Singaporeans know me … I’ve been a politician for 36 years, PM for 16 years. If I still depend on living in the house to exude a magic aura and impress the population, I think I would be in a very sad state and Singapore would be in a very sad state,” he responded.

> GAZETTING NOT EVEN RELEVANT: PM

> Among the emails that Mr Lim went through was one that the late Mr Lee sent to Mdm Ho, copied to PM Lee.

> He had said: “Yes, but Loong as PM has indicated he would declare it a heritage site that will put an end to any rebuilding.”

> In his evidence, PM Lee explained that they had discussed the matter repeatedly afterwards and that his father knew on Dec 27, 2011, when he wrote to the Cabinet, that the house would not be gazetted.

> Mr Lim produced another email from the late Mr Lee dated Sep 6, 2012 where he wrote: “Although it has been gazetted as a heritage house, it is still mine as owner.”

> PM Lee accepted that based on the email, his father believed the house had been gazetted at that point. However, he said that he did not discuss the matter with Mr Lee beyond May 2012.

> The lawyer pointed to another email dated Nov 30, 2013 sent to Mr Lee by his usual lawyer, Ms Kwa Kim Li. It stated: “Last night, you raised the possibility that Oxley may one day be de-gazetted after your passing.”

> PM Lee again stressed that he had not discussed gazetting the property with his father.

> When his own lawyer, Senior Counsel Davinder Singh, asked if gazetting was even a relevant point, he responded: “No. Even if it was not gazetted and I, after inheriting the house, would be allowed to redevelop and profit from it, I think it would have been a humongous stink. It’s impossible.”

> The trial continues on Tuesday afternoon with Mr Xu taking the stand.

> Retired diplomat Bilahari Kausikan has apologised to Lee Wei Ling, the daughter of late prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, for comments that he made on 38 Oxley Road.

> Accused by Lee Wei Ling of making a false claim

> In a post put up on July 14, 2020, Lee Wei Ling accused Bilahari of falsely claiming that her brother, Lee Hsien Yang, had bought their house at 38 Oxley Road for S$1, and that Yang was angry as he had been ""prevented from monetising the property"".

> In claiming that Bilahari had no right to make such a statement, Lee Wei Ling wrote:

> ""Yang did not buy the house for $1. He paid market price for the house to buy it from Loong, and made a further 50 per cent of the value of the house as a donation to charity.""

> She also claimed that Lee Hsien Yang had bought the house on the grounds that their father had given her the right to live in it for as long she wished and supposedly with the knowledge of statements made by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and National Heritage Board in April 2015:

> ""In view of the historical significance of the property, if a decision is made to allow for the demolition of the house, the Government is likely to disallow the site to be redeveloped in a way that would diminish its historical significance, for example, for commercial or intensive residential development.""

> Bilahari's apology

> Bilahari subsequently replied to the post by apologising.

> Here is Lee Wei Ling's post:

> What did Bilahari actually say?

> Lee Wei Ling was likely referencing an answer that Bilahari had given in the comments section of a Facebook post which he had put up on July 9.

> An online commenter had asked Bilahari if the house had been given to Lee Hsien Yang or if he had paid for it.

> Bilahari gave the following reply:

> Bilahari then corrected himself in the same thread and clarified that the house had been sold to Lee Hsien Yang at market price after it had been initially offered to Lee Wei Ling for S$1.

> What are the circumstances surrounding the sale of the house?

> According to a statutory declaration by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in 2017 over the matter, the circumstances surrounding the sale of the house are as follows:

> Both Lee Wei Ling and Lee Hsien Yang had expressed their unhappiness that PM Lee had been bequeathed with 38 Oxley Road, following the passing of their father in 2015.

> PM Lee was prepared to transfer the property to Lee Wei Ling for a ""nominal sum of S$1"".

> This came with the condition that should the property be transacted later or acquired by the government, all proceeds would go to charity.

> However, PM Lee was unable to reach a resolution with his two siblings who threatened to escalate attacks against him, during the period of GE2015.

> Subsequently, both of them agreed to his ""fresh proposal"", in the wake of GE2015, to transfer 38 Oxley Road to Lee Hsien Yang at market value, on the condition that both Lee Hsien Yang and himself each donated an amount equivalent to half of that value to charity, to pre-empt any future controversy over compensation or redevelopment proceeds.

> As such, in accordance with the agreement, PM Lee donated half of the value of 38 Oxley Road to charity.

> PM Lee added that he also donated a sum equivalent to the other half of the value of 38 Oxley Road to charity, although it was not required under the agreement.

> 38 Oxley Road is therefore wholly under the ownership of Lee Hsien Yang.

They will have to decide what to do with the Property and be able to carry the decision.

> The Committee has carefully studied the representations from Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s children. In reaching our views on Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s wishes, we relied particularly on the objective evidence placed before us and the key concrete steps that Mr Lee Kuan Yew himself took in his lifetime to put his wishes into effect. This included the demolition clause in Mr Lee Kuan Yew's last will, his letter to Cabinet dated 27 December 2011, as well as the renovation/redevelopment plans for 38 Oxley Road which he submitted to the URA in March 2012, and obtained approval for.

> SINGAPORE - The ministerial committee studying options for 38, Oxley Road concluded that the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew preferred that the house be demolished. 

> However, it also [noted in its report](http://www.pmo.gov.sg/newsroom/ministerial-committee-report-38-oxley-road) released on Monday (April 2) that the founding prime minister was aware Cabinet ministers and others were opposed to demolition, given the property&apos;s historical and heritage value, as well as their reading of public sentiments.

> In view of this, the late Mr Lee was prepared to accept other options besides demolition, the committee said - provided the property was refurbished and kept in a habitable state, and the family&apos;s privacy was protected.

> To come to its conclusion, the committee said it relied on objective evidence to understand Mr Lee&apos;s thinking and wishes on the property, and [found three to be particularly useful](http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ministerial-panel-lays-out-3-options-for-38-oxley-road-says-fate-of-lee-kuan-yews-house-is):

> - Mr Lee&apos;s letter to the Cabinet in December 2011,

> - The renovation/redevelopment plans for the property which he submitted to the Urban Redevelopment Authority in March 2012

> - The demolition clause in his last will in December 2013.

> Mr Lee wrote a letter to the Cabinet on Dec 27, following a meeting in July where he presented his views about the property and listened to the views of some Cabinet members.

> This letter acknowledged that Cabinet members were unanimous that 38, Oxley Road should not be demolished.

> Mr Lee wrote: ""I have reflected on this and decided that [if 38, Oxley Road is to be preserved](http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/home-of-former-pm-lee-kuan-yew-at-38-oxley-road-at-centre-of-dispute), it needs to have its foundations reinforced and the whole building refurbished. It must then be let out for people to live in. An empty building will soon decline and decay.""

> Exterior of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew&apos;s house at 38, Oxley Road. PHOTO: ST FILE

> This was Mr Lee&apos;s last formal communication to the Cabinet on the property, and was written less than a week after he executed his second will on Dec 21, 2011, which also includes the demolition clause.

> The ministerial committee noted that this letter acknowledges that the property may be preserved, and what Mr Lee&apos;s views were if that were to happen.

> The late Mr Lee Kuan Yew&apos;s letter to the Cabinet dated Dec 27, 2011. PHOTO: PRIME MINISTER&apos;S OFFICE

> The basement dining room of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew&apos;s house at 38, Oxley Road. PHOTO: ST FILE

> The ministerial committee said that based on an e-mail sent by Madam Ho Ching to the rest of the family on Jan 2, the renovation plans appear to have been specifically prepared with conservation requirements in mind.

> The detailed architectural plans were then approved by Mr Lee for submission to the URA in March 2012.

> He subsequently affirmed these plans in April and May 2012 after URA gave its approval, the committee said.

> The demolition clause in Mr Lee&apos;s last will [comprised two parts](http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/two-parts-to-demolition-clause-in-will-indranee), the committee noted.

> The first part states his wish that the house at 38, Oxley Road be demolished immediately after his death, or - if his daughter Lee Wei Ling would prefer to continue living there - immediately after she moves out.

> The second part then specifies his wishes in the event demolition was not possible, it said.

> ""If our children are unable to demolish the house as a result of any changes in the law, rules or regulations binding them, it is my wish that the house never be opened to others except my children, their families and descendants.""

> The committee noted this clause acknowledges the possibility that demolition may not take place, and how he did not want the house to be open to the public in such an event.

> SINGAPORE: The 120-year-old bungalow which was the bone of contention between Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his siblings Lee Wei Ling and Lee Hsien Yang has significant heritage, historical and architectural value, said the ministerial committee on 38 Oxley Road and the National Heritage Board (NHB) [in a report](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/38-oxley-road-lee-kuan-yew-lee-hsien-loong-ministerial-committee-10096302) on Monday (Apr 2).

> The ministerial committee described the house as “a unique architectural type which is testament to its cosmopolitan past and the property is among the remaining few built in this style”.

> The single-storey house was built in 1898 as one of a pair of bungalows. It was nicknamed “Castor” while its twin at 40 Oxley Road was nicknamed “Pollux”, after twin brothers in Greek and Roman mythology. ""Castor"" changed hands frequently then, a research report by the National Heritage Board said.

> Among more than 200 old bungalows conserved in Singapore, 16 belong to the same Early Style and era as 38 Oxley Road. Its former twin bungalow at 40 Oxley Road has been demolished and redeveloped into three lots.

>     38 Oxley Road is of an ""Early Style"" bungalow built in the late 19th and early 20th century. The blend of influences from the East and West, and from vernacular building give a variety of styles which can be broadly categorised into five architectural styles. (Photo: Screenshot/Ministerial Committee report)  


> Later during the Japanese Occupation between 1942 and 1945, houses along Oxley Road were converted into comfort houses, the NHB found.

> After the war, founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his new wife Kwa Geok Choo rented 38 Oxley Road, which was described as a “rambling house with five bedrooms and three others at the back which originally served as the servants&apos; quarters"". They paid 80 Straits dollars every month which went up to 118 Straits dollars by 1965, the report said.

> The couple decided to buy the bungalow in 1965 when security became a concern and decided to fortify the house against threats such as arrests and assassination attempts, said NHB.

> They added steel gates, additional brick walls and bullet-proof windows. Another house was also absorbed into the property, probably in the 1960s, to secure the back of the house after a police constable was shot dead there.

> “THE UNDERGROUND” PLAYED A ROLE IN STOKING PAP’S FIRE

> The ministerial committee’s report noted that the house was a familiar stomping ground for key political players in the 1950s, including former deputy prime minister Toh Chin Chye, Mr Samad Ismail who was the chief sub-editor of Utusan Melayu and unionist Fong Swee Suan.

> ""The Property was where meetings took place that led to the formation of the first independent government for Singapore, and altered the destiny of the country,"" the report said.

> The house’s basement dining room, nicknamed “The Underground” was where the People’s Action Party was founded and the house functioned initially as its headquarters as the party “could not easily find places to rent as landlords were worried about upsetting the authorities”.

> “Toh, Samad and Fong recalled that about 20 people huddled around the basement dining table for discussions. Dr Toh was the chairman and Lee Kuan Yew, the secretary and Lee Gek Seng, the assistant secretary. Lim Chin Siong, Fong and Devan Nair were among those who participated in the discussions,” the report said.

>        Basement dining room at 38 Oxley Road. (Illustration: Kenneth Choy)   

> “These meetings were held secretly, as the internal security regulations then forbade such political meetings. Dr Toh recalled that Ong Eng Guan suggested burying the minutes of the meetings in the garden,” it added.

> NHB also listed at least two other locations in the house where nationally significant events took place. First, the verandah where unionists and postal workers prepared posters and addressed election manifestos during the 1955 legislative assembly elections.

> Second, the study where Mr Lee would work on the contents of his ""[red box](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mr-lee-kuan-yew-s-battleship-telegram-now-on-display-at-national-8254870)"" which he used to file papers in during his political career.

>        The study at 38 Oxley Road. The estate of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew donated items, including the desk and other personal effects, to the National Heritage Board for the people of Singapore. (Illustration: Kenneth Choy)   

> BUILDING’S STYLE IS ‘TESTAMENT TO ITS COSMOPOLITAN PAST’

> The NHB report said that the house is built in the style of the Anglo-Indian bungalow but includes variations such as a raised-floor construction, verandahs and overhanging roof eaves to better suit Singapore’s tropical climate and the building’s location.

> Built on a slope, the house has a single storey at the front but two storeys at its rear, with arched openings used to ventilate the basement space. Lofty ceilings and an additional jack roof were created to let hot air rise and escape, and to cool the house, the report said.

> The verandah on 38 Oxley Road is described to be narrower than usual and is typically used for relaxation, entertainment and as a communal space. Part of the verandah was later enclosed and converted into a room.

>     One of the few alterations made to the house was the sealing off of part of the verandah to add an additional room to the building. A wheelchair lift was also added to the verandah in recent years. (Photo: Screenshot/NHB report)
  


> The house also contains “a mix of features that were popular in bungalows of its time, and are not commonly found today” such as full-length French windows, fretted timber balusters, classical columns, pilasters and plinths, and vented grills that fill the arch masonry, the report said.

> While the bungalow has gone through additions and alterations, the Ministerial Committee concluded that the original form and architectural character are largely intact. 

> “As the home of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s founding Prime Minister, 38 Oxley Road stands for the values that he and his wife exemplified both in their public and private lives – frugality and discipline in particular. The architectural simplicity of the house is reflective of the times, the site it sits on, as well as the values of its historic occupants,” said the NHB report.

The truth is different places have different priorities in preserving it.

For LKY's house of course it's a priority. For the old NLB it's not top on the list.

Singapore is not a monarchy, and Lee Kuan Yew doesn't deserve any special treatment for being the founding PM. Also he dead, so it doesn't concern him. 

It doesn't concern our ruling party, it concerns the head of the ruling party and his private issues with his siblings. 

>and the current head of state with trust in our government.

Yep. GCT had said previously that it is the duty of the PM to sue if allegations about him are made, as it's his duty to the citizens to do so and clear the record. 

So for this sort of issue the best thing would be to take it to court. It is ultimately an issue about wills, and lawyers and courts are set up to deal with that shit. Apart from that there are also the allegations that his siblings made about him, which are not a national/parliamentary issue either. He should clear the air directly, or live up to his surname and sue the dogshit out of them. 

But there already was an idiotic parliamentary session discussing this, where LHL ""ownself declared ownself"" that there is no deception or abuse of power. ",t3_8ae7zj,07-04-2018

2. only lhl allowed to speak his mind. the other 2 siblings were not there to give their povs. so all we heard is one sided argument from lhl on why lhl is not corrupt or dishonorable. unfair to the other 2 who only have FB to give their arguments. 

3. no tough qns from pap mps. even wp tread lightly. so waste of time also.

4. no answers about what role lawrence wong played or why docs given to nhb ended up with lhl

5. no answers as to how lhl's lawyer got documents submitted to nhb by the siblings

6. no answers as to why ho ching is listed as pmo contact person. 

7. http://theindependent.sg/why-did-national-heritage-boards-ceo-take-more-than-2-years-to-discover-clerical-error/

8. no good explanation on why ministerial committee was formed or whether its norm to form such committees everytime a major politician died. or why nhb cant do this work themselves. 

9. whats the deal with shanmugam since he was on the committee and also emailing advice to lwl.
