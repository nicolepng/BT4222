My focus is strength training but cardio is important for me as well.  I checked out True Fitness in Great World City and was very disappointed.  Thereâ€™s gotta be something better!

Edit:  I am looking more towards a hardcore bodybuilding gym, with a wide variety of free weights apparatus, benches, machines, dumbbells, etc.  Classes not a priority, nor are the gyms that require a personal trainer (seem to be so many of those here).  Atmosphere is key, so ideally it is a place where a lot of other meatheads like to train."
