Teachers want that performance bonus and career advancement progress when their students grade well. 

The personal goals of the individual does not always align with what the system intends. To reach these personal ends, more resources and effort are committed to the higher band classes; for it is their best hope for personal advancement.

Many see them as a retirement plan as well. 

Despite the resources that they have, there are still *many* poorer families where their children are doing fine, and are able to show a level of love richer famlies don't. Many of them are still happy.

The yearning to reproduce and carry on our genetic lineage is a primordial, powerful and fundamental driver of the all living things, much less the human species. It is the single driving force that compel us to band together first as tribes, then settlements and eventually civilisations. But now, when a person ends up on the wrong side of the socio-economic spectrum, suddenly this right to have children of his own becomes a 'luxury'? Bearing in mind that most cases of poverty are not by choice but of circumstances. 

We as a society has chosen to adopt a capitalistic socio-economic model of which inequality is a natural by-product. That is the social contract we are born into and which our ancestors and us consent to. But if the poor is a natural by-product, of what right do we have to penalise that against them? A harsh penalty, no less, denying them the choice of parenthood just because they are poor.

If having kids is a luxury, I wonder where you propose to draw the line. Maybe if a certain racial demographic consistently falls below an arbitrary socio-economic benchmark, that justifies the castration of the entire race? Or maybe the definition of 'middle class' expands and suddenly everyone who falls below 4.5k median salary should also lose the 'luxury' of having kids? See how dangerous eugenics in any form can quickly turn?

I am not denying the naked observation that kids in well-to-do families live better than kids in impoverished families, on an objective materialistic standard at least. I am not denying the life wisdom that if you cannot afford to feed yourself, it is not smart to have 5 kids.

> SINGAPORE — An 18-year-old man involved in a knife attack at an NTUC Fairprice outlet Boon Lay earlier this week was charged in court on Friday (9 October).

> James Teck Jing You, 18, was handed one charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to Lee Jing Chwen, 23, with a kitchen knife, by slashing Lee multiple times on his face and causing lacerations at about 12.42pm at Wednesday.

> The alleged offence was committed at Boon Lay Shopping Centre, which is at level two of Block 221 Boon Lay Place.

> During Teck’s hearing, the prosecution applied for Teck to be remanded for psychiatric observation. Asked by District Judge (DJ) Terence Tay if he had a record with the Institute of Mental Health, Teck, who appeared via video-link, replied “yes”.

> Given the investigating officer’s report, DJ Tay allowed the application for Teck, who was unrepresented, to be remanded for psychiatric assessment. His next hearing will be on 23 October.

> Photos of the incident circulating online on Wednesday showed Lee covered in blood and attended by paramedics. There were also photos depicting the closed Fairprice outlet, which was cordoned off in the aftermath of the incident.

> Following the incident, Lee was conveyed to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in a conscious state.

> Police said that they were alerted to the case at around 12.40pm. Through ground enquiries and with the use of CCTV footage, Teck was arrested on Wednesday.

> If convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a weapon, Teck faces an imprisonment for life, or for up to 15 years, and can be caned or fined.

454,22,dyoii7o,t3_8i2xt6,"SINGAPORE — At 24km long, with 24 stations, the Republic's seventh MRT line, Jurong Region Line (JRL), will open in three phases from 2026.

Slated to commence operations the year the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail is scheduled for completion, the JRL will connect the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Pandan Reservoir and Tengah area to the existing Choa Chu Kang and Boon Lay stations.

Unveiling the JRL alignment during a work site visit to the upcoming Canberra station on the North-South Line (NSL) on Wednesday (May 9), Transport Minister and Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure Khaw Boon Wan called the new line ""a quantum leap"" for Jurong's transport infrastructure.

The new line, which will run above ground, together with the upcoming KL-Singapore High Speed Rail, will give commuters ""convenient connections not just within western Singapore, but also to Malaysia"", he said, complementing the development of the Jurong Lake District into the ""largest commercial hub"" outside the Central Business District, alongside development of the new Jurong Innovation District into the ""next generation industrial estate"".

""When all these plans come together, Jurong will be a waterfront business hub nestled in greenery, served by good public transport connections, as well as amenities to support active mobility … This is our vision for Jurong,"" Mr Khaw added.

While the JRL improves the area's connectivity, the minister noted that it will also bring ""resilience"" to the entire MRT network. 



This is as commuters will have more choices when any of the two main lines, North-South Line or East-West Line (EWL), breaks down, since the JRL is connected to both Choa Chu Kang and Boon Lay.

""This will help to also distribute and relieve train loading between Choa Chu Kang and Jurong East stations, so that commuters can enjoy more comfortable rides,"" he added.

The Jurong area is currently connected by roads via the Pan Island Expressway and the Ayer Rajah Expressway. By train, the area is served by Lakeside, Boon Lay, and Jurong East stations, as well as Joo Koon and Tuas stations, which came into service in 2009 and 2017 respectively as extensions to the EWL.

On Wednesday, Mr Khaw also separately announced that Canberra Station, the new MRT stop between Sembawang and Yishun stations on the NSL, is expected to open for service by December next year, ""hopefully before Christmas"".

The construction of the station located along Canberra Link in Sembawang is on track to be completed for testing and commissioning in October next year.

Works commenced in early 2016, and to date, the station is 55 per cent completed, with more than 1.3 million man hours put in.

Canberra Station is the second station to be integrated onto an operational MRT line, with EWL's Dover station being the first.

Its addition will also put 17,000 more households within a 10-minute walk of a train station, putting the Ministry of Transport closer on its goal to bring eight in 10 households within that radius by 2030.",t3_8i2xt6,09-05-2018

> The car travelling on the right-most lane had to brake hard to avoid running the two children over, as a dozen pedestrians were similarly illegally jaywalking on the road to get to the centre divier.

> The two children who were almost hit appeared to have dashed across the road ahead of the other adults in the group who were leading other children more slowly across the road.

> The incident took place along the road beside the MRT track closer to Lakeside MRT station.

> The car was travelling in the direction towards Boon Lay MRT station.

> A video of the near-collision was shared online:

> The comments criticised the adults in the group for jaywalking and allowing the children to run ahead of everyone else without supervision.

> The mobile column arriving in Boon Lay attracted sizeable crowds who lined up to wave at the passing motorcade of military hardware.

> #####By Wan Ting KohReporter

> He was in a bad mood, so he decided to set fire to police cameras (Polcams) in Boon Lay. In November 2017, after having decided to burn the cameras, Lim Sin Ann went home to pick up a stool and some newspapers to do the deed.

> On Friday (19 January), Lim, 52, was sentenced to three months’ jail after he pleaded guilty to two counts of vandalism. He was sentenced to an additional month’s jail in lieu of caning due to his age, making his total sentence four months.

> Another count of vandalism and one count of theft of a PAssion card in an unrelated incident in November last year were taken into consideration for sentencing.

> The court heard that as Lim was in a bad mood, on 6 November last year, he went to Blk 212 Boon Lay Place to burn the Polcams after taking the necessary items from his home.

> At around 1.01am, Lim lit the newspaper on fire before climbing onto the stool to reach the cameras. He also used an umbrella to shield himself so that the Polcams would not capture his actions.

> About a minute later, Lim burned another camera with the newspaper.

> In all, Lim damaged three police cameras, causing their lenses and covers to be blackened. The cameras also recorded blurry images after the incident.

> Each police camera cost $327 in repairs. Lim did not make any restitution for the damaged cameras.

> Despite Lim’s attempts to shield himself, CCTV footage caught him in the act.

> The police received information about the damaged cameras on 27 November.

> On each count of vandalism, Lim could have been jailed up to three years and fined up to $2,000.

Infections in the community have increased with a two-year-old Singaporean girl among the 18 new community cases announced yesterday by the Ministry of Health (MOH).

The 17 other cases were five Singaporeans and permanent residents, two work pass holders and 10 work permit holders.

Ten of the community cases are linked to previous cases or clusters.

Eight of the community cases are unlinked. Of these, five cases are asymptomatic and were picked up as a result of MOH's proactive testing as they work in essential services.

The remaining three cases were tested under the enhanced criteria where all individuals aged 13 and above diagnosed with acute respiratory infection are swabbed at first presentation to a doctor.

MOH said: ""This allows us to detect infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread, as well as milder cases that have a short duration of infection.""

It added that epidemiological investigations are in progress for these cases.

The serological test results for two cases were positive, which indicate likely past infections.

The test results for the remaining cases are pending.

Boon Lay Place Market and Food Village are among places visited by Covid-19 patients while they were still infectious, said MOH yesterday.

It was visited by a confirmed case from 6.15am to 7.15am on June 21.

Toast Box and Courts at Jurong Point were visited by confirmed cases on June 28 from 3.20pm to 4.50pm. The same day, Fengshan Market and Food Centre was visited by a confirmed case from 8.30am to 9am.

Another two locations - a FairPrice supermarket at Jurong Point and NTI Food Court at Jurong West - were also visited by confirmed cases from 2.10pm to 2.40pm and 6.30pm to 7.30pm on July 1, respectively.

Those who were there at those time should monitor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit, MOH said.

559,22,e81wn3y,t3_9pi8t2," SINGAPORE - A female cyclist was badly injured after she was hit by a van in Boon Lay on Thursday (Oct 18).

In response to queries, the police said they were alerted to the accident in Boon Lay Way towards Upper Jurong Road at 5.22pm.

The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said that it responded to the accident at 5.30pm, and the woman was taken to the National University Hospital by ambulance.

 The 52-year-old was unconscious when taken to hospital, the police said.

The Straits Times understands that the injuries sustained by the woman were serious.

Be aware of your risks. Sure, depending on who was at legal fault for the accident there will be some blame. But regardless one must also introspect and recognize what one could have done to reduce putting yourself at risk, and especially prevent a repeat.

I get it, it's dangerous. But drivers, in accordance with their licence agreements, need to look out for other road users. IMO the driving skills in SG are shocking (as another driver and as a cyclist), people seem to have a ""teach others a lesson"" mentality",t3_9pi8t2,19-10-2018
571,22,e82a6g7,t1_e820sc9,Cycling on sidewalk can be dangerous to pedestrians. Its a reason why ebikes are banned on footpaths. Of course both driver and rider have to watch each other out.,t3_9pi8t2,19-10-2018

574,22,e829zdk,t1_e8271yn,"Well, I don know how much worse SG drivers are compared to others. Personally, SG roads are alot safer than US. 

But I do agree drivers should look out for others, and vice versa. 

It still doesn change my perspective that I would place myself at risk if I rode a bike on the road. But if its somethin you want to do, such as go faster or smoother, you have to accept those risks. 

Iv seen many accidents. Never have I seen someone die from peds on bike, barely hurt bad usually, but the damage you get from bike on car is pretty serious like in this case.",t3_9pi8t2,19-10-2018

> SINGAPORE - An immigration offender, who was facing money problems, armed himself with a chopper, fake gun and bogus bomb belt to try and rob a pawnshop in Boon Lay.

> But former construction worker Sheikh Md Razan failed to coerce the employees of a ValueMax outlet in Boon Lay Way to hand him any valuables.

> The Bangladeshi fled empty-handed but left behind his ""bomb belt"" during the failed robbery attempt on July 28 last year.

> It prompted officers from the Bomb and Explosive Branch to be sent to scene, and exits at the nearby Boon Lay MRT station were also shut for more than two hours as experts inspected the device.

> They were reopened after police found the ""bomb belt"" did not contain any explosives, a district court heard on Monday (Sept 30).

> Razan, 30, was sentenced to 3 1/2 years' jail with 18 strokes of the cane after he pleaded guilty to one count each of attempted armed robbery as well as exhibiting the fake gun and ""bomb belt"" when committing the offence.

> He also admitted to overstaying in Singapore for more than 200 days, being in possession of a forged work permit and using a second bogus work permit to seek illegal employment here.

> Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Chua said Razan hatched his robbery plan last year.

> She added: ""The accused decided to disguise himself with a turban as he had observed that his Sikh roommate's face was partially covered when he wore his turban. He also thought that he could throw the police off his trail by disguising himself as a member of a different ethnic group.""

> On July 27 last year, he made the fake gun and ""bomb belt"" by using such items as a metal pipe and components from a battery-operated toy dog.

> The next day, he went to the pawnshop around 4.30pm. The outlet had about $72,000 in cash and more than $15 million worth of jewellery.

> The court heard that he showed its employees the fake bomb before ordering them to place money and jewellery inside his bag. But none of the workers obeyed his orders. Instead, they tried to get away from him.

> Realising his plan was falling apart, Razan removed the fake bomb belt from his waist, placed it on a counter and fled.

> The outlet's branch manager, thinking the ""bomb belt"" was real, grabbed it and flung it towards an open space outside the shop before calling the police. Officers found the device was a fake.

> Meanwhile, Razan changed his clothes and shaved off his facial hair to alter his appearance. To shake off the police, he also took four different buses and a taxi to get away.

> He was arrested at Sultan Mosque on Aug 1 last year after a five-day islandwide manhunt.

> On Monday, DPP Chua urged District Judge Teo Guan Kee to sentence him to at least 3 1/2 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane.

> She said: ""While the accused may have failed in his planned heist, his actions caused considerable disruption and disquiet to the unsuspecting public. Exits at Boon Lay MRT station and Jurong Point had to be cordoned off and shut down for more than two hours as the authorities dealt with the threat from the accused's imitation bomb belt.""

> Defence lawyer Siraj Shaik Aziz, assigned to the case under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, said his ""genuinely remorseful"" client is determined to turn over a new leaf and restart his life in Bangladesh

> Offenders convicted of attempting to commit armed robbery can be jailed up to seven years and caned.
