> 
> SINGAPORE - A 65-year-old retired financial accountant who is passionate about environmental issues intends to run as an independent candidate in Pioneer SMC, raising the prospect of a four-cornered fight there.
> 
> Mr Victor Ronnie Lai told The Straits Times he has obtained a political donation certificate, and will put his name in the ballot on Nomination Day on Tuesday (June 30).
> 
> Mr Lai said he decided to run in Pioneer SMC because the name of the constituency represents hope and new beginnings.
> 
> He said he is running as an independent as he feels that a party would have people with different interests and purposes. ""I believe that any politician should be accountable for his or her own actions, which is why I decided to join as an independent.""
> 
> Friends call him ""Mr Sunflower"", he said, as he often carries the flower around with him - to him, the flower represents hope for the planet, and the importance of loving nature.
> 
> Mr Lai told ST in an exclusive interview on Sunday that climate change is an issue that he would champion if elected into Parliament.
> 
> For example, he would call for more funds to be funnelled into research that can help Singapore and the global community cut emissions. This includes studies into technologies that can capture carbon emissions and convert that into useful substances.
> 
> ""Some people may think that climate change is the responsibility of the future generation,"" he said. ""But I want to try to convince them that the reason we are able to have such a peaceful and enjoyable and prosperous life today is because the Pioneer Generation had worked hard for us.""
> 
> Pioneer SMC is now held by PAP MP Cedric Foo, who is expected to step down before the election. With the inclusion of Mr Lai, the single seat could see a four-way contest between him, the ruling People's Action Party and opposition parties the Progress Singapore Party and Peoples Voice.

> [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxkNSe--UH8)
> 
> Besides environmental issues, Mr Lai plans to focus on social and education issues.
> 
> On helping the needy, he said he is studying the feasibility of a scheme that would allow residents of the constituency to contribute to a fund, which is then disbursed to the needy.
> 
> ""This scheme will supplement other national assistance schemes,"" he said, adding that his political approach is one of unity, not division.
> 
> He also believes that the education system should be tweaked so that students can spend less time on homework and more time with their families.
> 
> Mr Lai said he is married with children, but declined to give more details, saying that he does not want his decision to contest the election to affect his loved ones.
> 
> He is now seeking a proposer, a seconder and at least four other assentors to support his candidature on Nomination Day. Those who are interested can e-mail him here (savinggaia2030@gmail.com).",t3_hhdoah,28-06-2020

Particularly, if you desire a long lasting outdoor graphic, be sure to request the inclusion of UV inhibitors to the inks to help prevent fading and prolong the life. Screen printing is preferred also because it lasts longer than digital printed signage since it can deposit more ink onto the substrate, which means there is more color.

> Take air conditioning, for instance, which enabled Singapore to become the thriving commercial and financial hub of Southeast Asia but contributes a significant proportion to carbon emissions.

> Indeed, current air conditioning technology – which is now a century old – has massive environmental costs.

> If the 3 billion people living in the tropics followed Singapore’s path of development, air conditioning would cook the planet. A 2018 study by Rocky Mountain Institute predicts the number of air conditioners in emerging economies to increase fivefold by 2050, contributing over 0.5 degrees Celsius of global warming by 2100.

> Yet recent commentary have singled out air conditioners unfairly. These couldn’t be further away from the truth when groundbreaking advances in this field have opened up new possibilities.

> Advertisement

> New climate-friendly technologies emerging here could not only provide comfort for billions, but could also help make Singapore the pinnacle of sustainable prosperity.

> INNOVATIVE COOLING TECHNOLOGIES

> Advertisement

> The new School of Design and Environment at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Kent Ridge campus is a precursor of a cool, energy-efficient future for office buildings and factories in coastal humid climates.

> The building has achieved almost net-zero energy consumption – the first of its kind in the tropics – with rooftop solar panels, a novel air conditioning system, and natural ventilation and lighting.

> Ceiling fans provide comfort and fresh air with much less refrigeration cooling, leading to enormous energy savings – up to S$180,000 per year.

> The shaded facades and the large overhanging roof of SDE4, sheltering the building from the sun’s heat. (Photo: Alif Amsyar)

> Such efforts have forged a path for bolder ideas for other net-zero energy buildings. Singapore Management University’s recently opened Tahir Foundation Connexion, for instance, boasts its own photovoltaic system, passive cooling design, and smart building control systems.

> Beyond cooling, dehumidifying could play a significant role in keeping us comfortable.

> Engineers at NUS, for example, realised that a desiccant wheel and a vacuum (which sucks water out of air with tiny tubular fibres) can remove most of the oppressive humidity more efficiently than compressor refrigeration. Some of the water then cools the air by evaporation.

> Practical solutions using these technologies are expected to emerge in the coming decade.

> In the meantime, they realised that liquefied natural gas arrives at Singapore at a temperature of about -160 degrees Celsius. They will tap into this ”cold” energy by piping it to data centres using water containing phase change materials – substances that absorb heat when transitioning from solid to liquid state.

> 

> They think that cooling data centres will be the first killer application demonstrating the commercial potential of their research on new cooling technologies.

> Cooling technologies aren’t limited to refrigerating and dehumidifying the air either. Researchers from the University of California Berkeley demonstrated how radiant cooling panels could be deployed in Singapore to cool people even when they’re outdoors – for instance, at a bus stop.

> These panels – chilled by cold water and designed to avoid condensation forming on their surfaces – keep people comfortable without cooling the air. When combined with desiccants for dehumidification, they could potentially lead to large energy savings.

> Another out-of-the-box solution is the personal air conditioner, which has proven its effectiveness in some of the hottest parts of the world and is now also available in Singapore. It provides cooling for people without having to cool entire spaces or buildings.

> Like a tiny fridge with a fan inside, it generates a gentle breeze that cools people nearby using as little as 300 Watts – far less than conventional room air conditioners, which use 900 to 2,400 Watts.

> Two men walking in the underground cooling system installation of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and resort. (Photo: AFP/Roslan RAHMAN)

> All these energy saving ideas can help quell the urban heat-island effect that has raised Singapore’s night-time temperatures by up to 7 degrees Celsius, due in part to warm air belched out from energy-hungry air conditioners and gasoline engines in cars.

> SOLAR TO POWER GREEN COOLING

> In the long-term, these ideas can also help Singapore meet its targets to halve peak carbon emissions by 2050, and to reach net-zero emissions thereafter.

> By then, energy-efficient technologies will displace older air conditioning technologies. Natural, environment-friendly refrigerants will replace today’s hydrofluorocarbons. And renewable solar and wind electricity will supplant the use of fossil-fuelled electric power generators.

> Electric vehicles and other innovations could help Singapore decrease its greenhouse emissions to near-zero.

> Plentiful, cheap solar electricity is already providing most day-time electricity generation in some countries. Australia has one of the highest penetration rates of rooftop and large-scale solar systems worldwide. Daytime electricity prices have plummeted and are sometimes negative.

> However, night-time power could be a different challenge altogether, turning energy-management techniques upside down. For decades, savvy individuals and businesses have exploited cheap off-peak power at night from fossil-fuelled power stations that run best with a steady load.

> In the solar, climate-constrained future, night-time power will mostly come from costly battery storage or fossil-fuelled generators with carbon-capture and storage. The latest estimates indicate a wholesale price around S$0.35 cents a unit.

> The meter price will be even higher, accelerating consumer demand for energy-efficient air conditioning technologies.

> File photo of solar panels. (Photo: Jeremy Long)

> Thermal batteries could be a cheaper option than the better known electrical batteries for air conditioning systems. These can be as simple as large tanks that store water chilled with cheap daytime solar electricity. The chilled water can be used later to provide cooling through the night.

> Phase change materials can also be used to boost the thermal capacity of the water, in effect enabling more cooling energy to be stored in the same volume of water.

> EMERGING MARKETS RIPE FOR COOLING SOLUTIONS

> The real action will be in Asian economies with huge urban populations: China, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

> Only a tiny minority today can afford routine use of conventional energy-guzzling air cons. People living in poorly insulated high-rise buildings will be increasingly desperate for cooling as the climate warms.

> The US$3 million (S$4.1 million) Global Cooling Prize will soon announce which of eight innovations has won the quest for a split air conditioner replacement with five-times less climate impact. Nevertheless, the organisers accept that these machines could be twice as expensive or more compared with today’s models.

> Some of the energy-efficient innovations emerging in Singapore today could be the answer so many people have been searching for. Positioned at the doorstep of the world’s fastest-growing economies with nearby air conditioner manufacturing centres in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, the opportunities for Singaporean innovators and entrepreneurs are plenty.

> I am confident that in the not-too-distant future we will see cheap and energy-efficient air conditioning across the region accessible to all, running mostly on renewable electricity.

> We will remember today’s climate emergency forecasts and wonder why we did not seize this golden opportunity earlier.

> James Trevelyan is CEO and Founder of Close Comfort, a cooling solutions company based in Singapore and Australia.

282,22,g8paih1,t3_ja7z0i,"I'm not sure if people here asking for more insulated houses have lived through a summer in a more wintry region before. Well-insulated houses become insanely hot in the summer and necessitate the use of air-conditioning. In Singapore, at least in my family, AC is not on 24/7. With a more insulated house, that would likely become necessary. Sure, your AC would be more power efficient, but not using AC is the most power efficient thing.

Yeah, sure, houses in the US and UK are more insulated. Their houses also often turn into ovens when the outside temperature approaches 30 C. If flats in Singapore are built like that then AC would have to be on year-round. Not only does it have implications for power consumption, it just kinda _sucks_ to be in an AC room 24/7 with no outside air. It likely makes much more sense for non-residential buildings that are going to be air-conditioned 24/7 anyway.

For residential buildings, it's probably much better to do the opposite and increase natural ventilation and porosity, while using cooling facades and roofs to minimise thermal load. There are many many strategies that go beyond just insulating the heck out of a building. See: https://www.coolingsingapore.sg/catalogue-of-strategies

I will say that while building energy-efficient houses with tiny windows doesn't make sense in the Singaporean context (even double glazed windows are more poorly insulated than walls, so houses in temperate regions often have smaller windows) double-glazed windows probably make sense, because if your AC is off your windows will be open anyway.",t3_ja7z0i,13-10-2020

See my other comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ja7z0i/comment/g8paih1

Essentially, you're thinking in 24/7 AC mode. Without AC, insulation gives you a greenhouse-effect type situation, in addition to the fact that houses have a lot of heat sources (people, electronics, stoves/ovens) that would make the indoor temperature significantly above ambient if overinsulated. 

In a residential building when air-conditioning isn't always on, actually minimising insulation and minimising heating load from the sun would allow you to get close to the outside air temperature, which is often cool enough (at least for my family, we only use AC for the super hot days). These are contradictory goals, so you won't ever see minimised insulation, but you also won't see residences anywhere near as stuffy as the typical American house, which I'm more familiar with than the UK.",t3_ja7z0i,14-10-2020

First, it is entirely possible to have a house that selectively permits a draft to pass through to allow for natural cooling, but has well insulated doors, windows and walls and that can be closed up for ac use. Windows and skylights can be double glazed, gasketed and yet be openable to allow air to circulate. You imply a design conflict that does not exist.

Solar radiation on a south facing vertical surface in Singapore averages to something like 400 watts per square meter as long as the sun shines. An uncoated, single  glased Windows permit about 90% of this value to enter a building.  If you lived in a tiny windowless flat that had say 20 sq meters of exterior walls ( #milleniallife amirite) permitting just 20% (a low figure) of this solar energy to pass through you would need to find a way to to get rid of 1600 watts of heat. If you had 2 sqm  of windows, this figure becomes 2320 watts. Any change in the percentage of exterior heat gain results in very large changes to amount of heat you must reject. For context,  this is the same heat output of a decent sized electric  stove on full power all the time. And this heat output is the average solar heat gain. Peak heat gain figures are going to be substantially higher. The point is that you would need a huge bitcoin mining operation, or be running an industrial kitchen to stand any chance of fighting the sun. And if you did, nothing about having good insulation should stop you from opening windows and vents.

There is a reason that LEED certification in the tropics still requires low heat gain and low heat transfer walls and windows. Whatever heat is coming in is usually large in relation to what is generated internally. And we can deal with what is generated internally in more effective ways than simply having poor insulation.",t3_ja7z0i,14-10-2020

304,22,g8so74a,t1_g8rt22d,"Firstly, 'energy-efficient housing' in the US often just have smaller windows, because even double-glazed windows aren't as insulated as a well-insulated wall. This is why minimising heat flux isn't a good design principle in the tropics in general. Minimising heat flux given other constraints isn't necessarily as bad; in my other comment I mention that double-glazed windows would still be helpful.

Secondly, I suspect you overestimate the solar irradiance heat flux. Only 50% of sunlight is in the visible range, and UV and IR is largely reflected; more so of course with coated windows. In addition, due to the fresnel effect, a large amount of midday irradiance is reflected away.

Finally, with the right coatings, external walls and façades can actually be cooler than air temperature, even in the day. In that situation minimising insulation would actually minimise indoor temperatures. This is not the case in a typical building, of course, but is likely a better solution for the tropics. https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5087281",t3_ja7z0i,14-10-2020

> SINGAPORE - The National Solidarity Party (NSP) intends to contest Tampines GRC, Sembawang GRC and the Pioneer and MacPherson single seats at the next general election.

> NSP secretary-general Spencer Ng on Sunday (March 22) said his party would contest the same constituencies that it did in GE2015.

> He will lead a team to contest in Sembawang, and party president Reno Fong will helm another team to stand in Tampines, Mr Ng told reporters during a walkabout in Tampines Street 81.

> Party members distributed hand sanitiser to members of the public, including shopkeepers.

> So far, about 10 party members are interested in standing for election, and the NSP is still reviewing them before unveiling its slate of candidates, Mr Ng added.

> The applicants include entrepreneurs and professionals from the IT and logistics sectors who are aged between the late 20s and early 50s, he said.

> The NSP joins a growing number of opposition parties that have indicated where they will contest for the GE, which is expected to be held in the next few months following the release of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee's report earlier this month.

> Most parties have said they would run in the constituencies that they contested in 2015.

> But the entry of newly formed Progress Singapore Party (PSP), led by former People's Action Party veteran MP Tan Cheng Bock, has raised the possibility of multi-cornered fights.

> The PSP earlier indicated that it would contest 15 constituencies, including West Coast GRC, Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, Sembawang GRC, Pioneer SMC, Radin Mas SMC and the new Marymount SMC.

> The NSP, Reform Party (RP) and Singapore People’s Party (SPP) have staked their claim on these constituencies as well.

> RP said in a post on its Facebook page on Saturday (March 21) that it ""will continue to serve the residents by contesting in West Coast GRC, Ang Mo Kio GRC and Radin Mas SMC"".

> SPP has said it will field candidates in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC as well as Potong Pasir, Marymount and Mountbatten SMCs.

> Party chairman Jose Raymond will be its candidate in Potong Pasir, while secretary-general Steve Chia will lead a team to contest in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.

> Singapore Democratic Alliance chairman Desmond Lim Bak Chuan told The Straits Times that the party will be contesting in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

> The party has contested there since 2006 and has been working the ground since, he added.

> ""We will continue to contest in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC... We suggest (for opposition parties) to go elsewhere. Don't duplicate our actions and waste resources,"" Mr Lim said.

> NSP's Mr Ng said his party is set to meet PSP on Monday for talks, adding that while multi-cornered fights risk duplicating resources, they are a sign of democracy at work. ""It's kind of messy, but that's democracy,"" he said.

> His party could see a three-way fight in Tampines GRC as well, as the Workers' Party has been seen walking the ground there. The WP has yet to announce the wards it will be contesting.

> Related Story Singapore GE: Tan Cheng Bock set to contest West Coast GRC as PSP eyes 15 constituencies

> The descendants also met lawyer Michael Stewart, 71, whose great-great-grandfather was Sir Stamford Raffles' nephew.

> The event at the heritage gallery of Tan Tock Seng Hospital was organised by Mr Roney Tan.

> He said the purpose of the gathering was to meet and to discuss and learn more about their ancestors' likely intertwined histories.

> On May 31, 1969, racial riots spilled over from Malaysia to Singapore, and the ensuing week-long clashes left four people dead and 80 injured.

> In its aftermath, the first batch of 120 national servicemen officer cadets helped ensure peace. For weeks, they set up roadblocks and patrolled the kampungs in Katong and Geylang, where Chinese and Malay families lived.

> At the first Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Day on July 1, 1969, the group was asked to take part in a parade at Jalan Besar Stadium that was attended by then defence minister Lim Kim San.

> These were experiences that moulded the pioneer batch of national servicemen SAF officers, who were commissioned on July 10, 1969, at the then SAF Training Institute (Safti) in Pasir Laba Camp in Joo Koon. The institute was set up in February 1966.

> Before this batch, the officers who graduated from Safti were all regulars.

> More than 40 pioneer officers from the batch met at a restaurant in East Coast Road yesterday. It was their fifth and largest gathering since the first one in 2015 initiated by retired Lieutenant-Colonel Albel Singh, 70.

> A book titled That Motley Bunch was launched at the get-together to mark their commissioning 50 years ago. It featured mainly black-and-white photographs of them in training, including taking unarmed combat lessons and firing a general-purpose machine gun.

> The book, which is not for sale, was written by The New Paper's former sports journalist Brian Miller, 69, who is also a member of the group. It describes some of the highlights of their military days, such as their commissioning parade at Safti and deployment in the 1969 racial riots.

> Related Story Servicemen and their families recognised at ceremonies, parade marking SAF Day

> They were full-time national servicemen for three years, compared with the current two years of national service.

> LTC (Retired) Singh, who was among the first 900 men enlisted in 1967, said the 1969 deployment when they carried live ammunition was among his most memorable experiences as a trainee.

> ""In the past, there was a lot more confusion and we were still in testing mode. Today, training is a lot more systematic and there is no wastage of time,"" he added.

> He signed on as a regular after his national service in 1970 for a monthly pay of $400, and served in the military for 32 years.

> The oldest is Mr Foo Ming Yeow, 80, a former human resource director who retired in 2006. He was drafted as part of his bond with the Singapore Government.

> Others from his batch enlisted at 18 years old or after completing their university studies. They went through three months of basic military training, a six-month section leader course and 71/2 months as an officer cadet.

> The Sword of Honour recipient from the batch, or best trainee, was veteran banker Ng Tat Pun, 74.

> He was among those drafted into the army after he finished his studies at the then University of Singapore, and found a job in the private sector that paid up to $1,000 a month. As a military recruit, his allowance was $60 a month.

> ""Although we were very unhappy and complained a lot, looking back, we learnt how to get along with people from different backgrounds, and developed leadership skills that made a difference in our careers later,"" he said.
