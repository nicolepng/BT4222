For those who still don't understand what M'sia is trying to pull with the Johor port limit extension, I've made a simplified version of the map that KBW showed at the conference earlier. You can see that if Malaysia got their way, they'll effectively control the remaining access to our Tuas facilities. It's basically cutting off one of our economic lifelines, not to mention a blatant sovereignty grab. Seriously, man.

**Lyrics**   
We know you want it   
It's ok to want what isn't yours   
But hey there's a limit   
When you can't tell it's Johor or   
Singapore?   
You claim that chendol's not ours   
Pedra Branca also yours   
What more do you want to gain?  
And now you've intruded our waters (Not once but so many times)   
What next? Even our two durians?   
We know Malaysia boleh!   
But that doesn't mean it's ok   
Sail to our side in sneaky ways   
Even chendol is yours, you say   
It's up to you, it's up to me   
Stay on our sides and stay happy   
Remember Pedra Branca   
We won it back but so tao tia!  
Wah piaaaaaang!   


Please tolong stoppit.
