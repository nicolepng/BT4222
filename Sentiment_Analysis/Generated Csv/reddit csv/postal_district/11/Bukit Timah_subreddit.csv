47,11,The Origin of the Legend of Bukit Timah,0,iwrbxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iwrbxy/the_origin_of_the_legend_of_bukit_timah/,17,21-09-2020,"I think many of you here must have learned this legend back in school: swordfishes are terrorizing Singapore, but a clever boy devises traps that help to end their threat once and for all. But then, the ruler feels that the boy might pose a threat to his rule, so he sends soldiers to kill a boy. And the boy's blood covers the entire hill, and till now, the soil is still red.

Here's a question, though: where did this myth originate from? So far, I have not been able to find any results, with Wikipedia not even mentioning the myth at all.

Is there any basis to the myth? I mean, the ending is obviously too fantastical to be real (more than likely, the soil was always red), but I wonder if swordfishes were ever a problem for Singaporeans in the past (even then, I doubt to the extent as portrayed in the myth). 

Has anyone ever done any research to find the origin of the myth, or at least the circumstances behind it? Maybe some research on if the myth holds any possible symbolism?"
