The park is the centerpiece of what has become a trendy neighborhood known for its brunch scene. One generally associates the modern city-state of Singapore with a dense urban concrete jungle but it is in fact more lush than it gets credit for. The point of the spear on the Malay Peninsula, standing sentinel over the Strait of Malacca it is one of the marvels of modern development. Fifty years ago it was not much more than a sweaty, shady, backwater but thanks to the benevolent, enlightened dictatorial leader Lee Kuan Yew it has risen to the heights of global trade and commerce. An essential cog in the wheel of Asia and therefore the world's economy. If you aren't aware of [Lee Kuan Yew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew) you should be, his biography is impressive and important and in the long arc of Asian history his influence will resonate loudly for decades to come.

Not quite. Singapore was a 150-year-old, thriving colonial city at independence; hardly a 'sweaty, shady backwater'.

And yes, they're [fighting](https://youtu.be/K_9u-KF3BqI), not mating. This is a [test of strength and endurance](https://youtu.be/Kpb_KOBwn2U) between males, and whoever manages to [pin his rival to the ground](https://youtu.be/jpxgWjj4tKw) wins. It's a way to [sort out the hierarchy](https://youtu.be/gaPk2zrH_KA), and for larger individuals to [demonstrate their dominance](https://youtu.be/Atw_VSdTx-4), without resorting to more violent fights that could result in one or even both of them being fatally wounded. Because of the way these monitors grab each other with the front limbs, you'll often see old males with [lots of scarring](https://flic.kr/p/9pSs77) on the shoulders and upper back.

[Wrestling](https://youtu.be/rvC8qftEA7A) seems to be [prevalent](https://youtu.be/HdQBlXub3iM) in the monitor lizard family; even the Komodo Dragon, largest of the monitor lizards, also [engages in this behaviour](https://youtu.be/m63vUqtFbEE).

[Mating](https://youtu.be/UIfqakHM2L0) in monitor lizards is [a much gentler affair](https://youtu.be/ZJ7XqT0eidw) - you'll see both of them on the ground, with [their tails intertwined](https://youtu.be/ZX30uurdjdw) - the female is below, and she has to [lift her tail up and to the side](https://youtu.be/4pdC2kyZ0Vw) so that her cloaca (the single opening at the base of the tail that reptiles and birds use for pooping, peeing, and mating) can [make contact with the male's](https://youtu.be/pQW6PZL0MiU).

How much is equal though?

Cheap enough that everyone can afford? That means $0, since that's what some of us can afford. Who pays for the land and the construction then? The tax-payers? Does this mean everyone pays the same tax? If not, it's just another form of inequality, since some of us pay more tax than others.

Or at median price, so half of us can afford it. Too bad about the other half? I guess they can always rent.

Also, since it's the equal price, who decides the allocations? How to decide so that it's equal? Should a pregnant lady be prioritized over a cancer patient for proximity to medical care facility? How about the old man who wants to stand near his children? Maybe random selection? Too bad about those who have bad luck then. After all, equal is equal.

&#x200B;

>Why segregate people by class?

Because the universe has finite resources, equality is impossible. Each individual will have access to different amount of resources. Time is one unshareable resource. If your parent spend time talking to your sibling, they will have less time for you. Space is another unshareable resource. If I stand in this space, you cannot occupy it too. 

Since resources are finite and unshareable, inequality will inevitably occur.

Animals have classes and hierarchy. Human is an animal. We are not exceptional.

525,11,eem0n90,t3_ai66ja,"Great sighting! It's a [Barred Eagle Owl](https://singaporebirds.com/species/barred-eagle-owl/), also called the Malay Eagle Owl. For some time, it was thought to be locally extinct in Singapore, but then there were sightings in Central Catchment Nature Reserve and [Bukit Timah Nature Reserve](https://alanowyong.wordpress.com/2016/01/18/the-wait-is-finally-over/). In 2017, a juvenile was seen on Pulau Ubin, and adults were heard calling in the vicinity, suggesting that the species was breeding on the island. Last August, a breeding pair [with a juvenile](https://singaporebirds.com/2018/09/05/first-breeding-record-of-the-barred-eagle-owl-in-singapore-island/) was recorded at the Singapore Quarry in Dairy Farm Nature Park. It's unknown whether this species was simply hiding in our forests all along, or whether these are birds from Johor dispersing to Singapore and re-establishing a population; in any case, it's great to see one of the top predators of the forest back in Singapore again.

The Eagle Owls in general are known for their large size, hence the common name ""Eagle Owl"" - the species most familiar to Europeans, the [Eurasian Eagle Owl](https://www.owlpages.com/owls/species.php?s=1240) (and Draco Malfoy's pet), is one of the largest owl species, and is a powerful predator; it has been known to take on small deer and mountain goats. It also has no problems hunting smaller species of owls and hawks; here's a badass nestcam video from Israel of an Eurasian Eagle Owl [snatching a Long-legged Buzzard nestling](https://youtu.be/o7KXvs7WJWM).

Recent genetic research indicates that the [Snowy Owl](https://www.owlpages.com/owls/species.php?s=1210) (yes, Hedwig) is a species of Eagle Owl that's adapted to life in the Arctic, while over in North America, the [Great Horned Owl](https://www.owlpages.com/owls/species.php?s=1220) is the ecological equivalent of the Eurasian Eagle Owl, although it's a lot smaller. There are a number of other species of Eagle Owls found in South America, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.

The Barred Eagle Owl isn't as large as the Eurasian Eagle Owl, but it's still one of the largest owl species in the region, and is capable of [taking juvenile Long-tailed Macaques](https://nss.org.sg/wildbirdsingapore/BarredEagleOwlpredatesLongTailMacaque.pdf). And here's a bit of trivia - this species was described in 1822 by Sir Stamford Raffles himself. 

For those of you who live in the Bukit Timah and Dairy Farm area, or go jogging there in the early morning, you might  get a chance to hear the Barred Eagle Owls [calling](https://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Bubo-sumatranus), or even catch a glimpse of one in the trees.",t3_ai66ja,21-01-2019

> ST understands that the male passenger was in the front passenger seat, while the deceased was [seated in the rear](http://str.sg/opFg).

> The accident was believed to have happened when the black Mercedes was making a right turn from Jalan Anak Bukit to enter the Pan-Island Expressway.

> The SMRT bus, understood to be off service at the time, was going straight along Jalan Anak Bukit towards Clementi Road, when the vehicles collided at the traffic junction.

> The SMRT bus that was damaged in the accident. ST PHOTO: POON CHIAN HUI

> Photos of the scene showed the SMRT bus with its windscreen severely smashed and glass shards strewn across the road.

> The black Mercedes could be seen with dents on its left passenger door.

> Police investigations are ongoing. ST has contacted SMRT for more information.

> This is the second fatal accident reported in recent days.

> On Thursday evening, National University of Singapore undergraduate Kathy Ong, 19, died after the Silvercab taxi she was in [collided with a car](http://str.sg/opKM).

> Ms Ong was a rear-seat passenger in the taxi with three other friends, who were all injured in the accident at the junction of Clementi Road and Commonwealth Avenue West.

542,11,dxrut1p,t3_8e1hxb,"As someone from Europe living in SG for a more than a year now, I am absolutely appalled by the drivers in Singapore. Not letting people pass in residential areas, not stopping at a crossings, driving through red lights and always rushing is the norm. I see that every day and cannot understand how this can happen in otherwise very organised and peaceful country. I don't know how many times I almost got hit by crazy drivers while riding my bike. And I only ride in residential areas on weekends, and never on the big roads. They just don't bother to slow down. I guess the thinking is that I should just jump out of their way?

The mentality here is absolutely inverse of Europe where it's drilled into you during the driving test that pedestrians always have higher priority and you aways let them pass, even if they are crossing in the wrong place. Here drivers simply rush through the designated crossing pretending not to see people waiting there. This kind of asshole-driving just makes me angry instantly. I would expect such behaviour in other countries of SE Asia but not Singapore. That's one thing that strikes me the most here.

Well, accident can happen at any time, and even if the driver of the car you're in drives safely he/she may still be hit by someone else. Not sure about regulations in Singapore, but the feature in so many cars that keeps beeping until you wear seat belts saves lives.

When i brought this up with friends who drive, they simply tell me it's because they're more experienced, so they can afford to skirt the driving laws, someone even told me that it's more dangerous to drive at the speed limit, thus he always has to drive 20 above the limit, like whaaaat?

555,11,dxt7p47,t1_dxrut1p,"I always wonder at car culture around the world. 

In Australia, drivers are really competent and courteous. Drivers generally let you into merging lanes and keep to the speed limits. They always signal in the roundabouts (according to aussie convention), they know which vehicles have right of way and give way, they don't drive under the speed limit in the overtaking lane, they pull over when sirens are blaring, etc. If a driver gets ticked at you in Australia it's usually either because you're Asian and they're racist (sorry Brisbane, it's the truth) or they've given you way and you're not taking it because you're used to Singaporean drivers barging in and blocking your way. 

In Thailand and Indonesia and Vietnam, traffic can be bad and it's a constant honk fest, but no one seems to be *angry* at each other. 

In contrast, Korean drivers are all ""rules? what rules?"" and constantly pissed off at every other driver on the road. 

If I can venture a guess, I think the high price of cars in Singapore and a lack of driving skill is what makes Singaporean drivers so shitty. The high price makes buyers of cars feel like they sacrificed a lot for the privilege of owning a car. Cynically, it makes you feel *superior* to those who don't have a car... like cyclists and pedestrians. I can't explain the crappy driving skill of Singaporeans (as opposed to being inconsiderate - I'm talking inability to maintain cruising speeds, constant tapping on brakes, accelerating down a slope and then jamming on your brakes at the bottom, things like that), but the attitude combined with crappy skills = dangerous drivers. 

I have to add on that in your particular case, I don't know your skin colour but unfortunately we are racist as fuck and the moment we see a white man on a bicycle we assume the worst. You will never hear this said to your face, but it does happen: ""chao ang mor cyclist thinks he owns the road, go back to copenhagen / melbourne if you like cycling so much"" or variants. It's not helped that every time there is an altercation on the roads between a cyclist and a driver is caught on dashcam goes viral, it's some white-skinned man in tights magically transforming between road traffic and pedestrian traffic at an intersection, ending in the driver and rider both screaming obscenities at each other.

>Not letting people pass in residential areas

Generally there are traffic lights and zebra crossings, and residents shouldn't be jaywalking when there's a car around, but on the occasion that people are stupid enough to jaywalk despite incoming traffic I've seen the cars let them pass *every single time*.

First you gotta have the equipment, if you have developed BW film before you don't need to get anything else!

The chemicals are hard to find in Singapore, and shipping in from overseas is difficult due to their chemical properties. Personally I got my father who was travelling back from the States to bring it over! 

The most crucial part in development is the temperature control, especially during the developer stage. If the temperature is even 0.2¬∞C off there would be colour shifts in the film and your images would look abit wonky.
I used a sous vide machine to keep the temperature consistent, but even then my film come out weird so I just gave up and send it to a lab like Triple D where they have dedicated machines! Only problem is that they aren't too careful with your film and may scratch it.

>#NUS graduate posted video of boyfriend's birthday bash an hour before fatal Bukit Timah accident

>^(PHOTO: National University of Singapore graduate Jasmine was a rear-seat passenger in a car when it collided with an SMRT bus at a traffic junction in Bukit Timah on Sunday at about 1am.)

>She had described her relationship with her boyfriend as a ""fairy tale"".

>And on Saturday (April 21), Ms Jasmine Lim, 23, was celebrating his birthday and posting live videos of the party right up to midnight.

>About an hour after she posted a last video on Instagram, she was involved in a fatal accident.

>The National University of Singapore (NUS) graduate was a rear-seat passenger in a car when it collided with an SMRT bus at a traffic junction in Bukit Timah on Sunday at about 1am.

>Ms Lim died from her injuries after being taken unconscious to the National University Hospital. The 24-year-old woman driver and her front-seat passenger, a 26-year-old man, were injured. They were taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital.

>Lianhe Wanbao reported on Monday (April 23) that the two who survived the crash are a couple.

>Ms Lim had described her relationship with her boyfriend as a ""fairy tale"" on her social media pages.

>On April 1, she shared a photo on Instagram of them celebrating their second year together.

>According to her LinkedIn profile, Ms Lim graduated from NUS Business School in 2017 and joined Procter & Gamble as an assistant brand manager for SK-II in February.

>In May 2016, she was part of a team from NUS that clinched a prestigious international title for Singapore in a business case competition in the United States.

>Professor Hum Sin Hoon, who was the team's faculty adviser, described her as capable and bright. ""Everyone who knew her loved her,"" he said. ""She was the one who injects life into every group.""

>The Deputy Dean of NUS Business School recalled her ""carrying the school flag"" in Seattle. ""It was my privilege to know her.""

>Friends of Ms Lim remember her as a cheerful girl who had a highly infectious love for life.

>One of Ms Lim's university classmates, who declined to be named, described Ms Lim as a bubbly and sweet girl who was ""a ray of sunshine to many"".

>""She always found joy and excitement in the things she did,"" she said.

>She said Ms Lim enjoyed discussing her plans for the future, including her wedding and the children she intended to have.

>A Victoria Junior College schoolmate said she had a big heart.

>""She was someone who always loved unconditionally and just wanted everyone around her to be happy,"" the 23-year-old said.

>Ms Lim's father said the family is grieving, and declined to be intervewed.

>The family ran a slideshow remembering Ms Lim at the wake, held at Mount Vernon Sanctuary.

>It included photographs and videos from her life, including a picture of her as a toddler wearing her father's shoes. A more recent photo, which she posted online, showed her eating a meal with her ""Procter & Gamble bestie"".

>Rainbow-coloured markers and bubble stickers were passed around at the wake, for friends and family to write her wishes in notebooks that would be sent off with her.

>The accident is believed to have happened when the car Ms Lim was in made a right turn from Jalan Anak Bukit to the Pan Island Expressway.

>The SMRT bus, understood to be off-service at the time, was going straight along Jalan Anak Bukit towards Clementi Road, when the vehicles collided. The bus driver was not injured.

>Police investigations are ongoing. SMRT said that the bus driver has been reassigned to non-driving duties, while assisting with investigations.",t3_8eqk64,25-04-2018

> Following the incident, anyone who walks or drives into the condo will have to produce their identity card or proof of residence at the guard post, according to the Apr 27 notice by residential manager Alex Tan.

> The condo has also temporarily disabled residents' access cards, car lanes and side gates.

> ""The patient (not a resident) bypassed our security checks,"" said Mr Tan in the notice.

> ""He was driven in by a resident (tenant) through the resident's lane and stayed several days in his apartment. This is in serious violation of the circuit breaker laws,"" he said, adding that the authorities are handling the matter, including contact tracing.

> Under the circuit breaker measures, people who do not live in the same household ‚Äì including family members ‚Äì are not permitted to meet except under certain circumstances.

> Mr Tan said the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed one case of COVID-19 at Signature Park, and that the condo has completed cleaning and disinfecting of affected areas.

> CNA has contacted MOH for comment.

> Mr Chan Kok Hong, managing director of Savills Property Management which manages Signature Park, told CNA the incident occurred ""a few days ago"".

> ""That is something which the MOH has taken up,"" Mr Chan told CNA on Friday (May 1), when asked if the matter had been reported to the police.

> ""With all these advisories and social distancing, any citizen who violates that will be discovered once the person (with COVID-19) goes to hospital. So I'm sure the authorities will take it up from there. We don't need to report it (to the police).

> ""In this case, things have taken its natural course.""

> Mr Chan also said in response to questions that Signature Park implemented the additional security measures following instructions from the condominium management council to take the ""strictest measures they can"".

> ""It's obviously scared the wits out of them and they have the power to do that,"" he said, adding that it was also ""for the sake of the residents"".

> Mr Chan said he has not received any feedback from residents on the measures, but believes that most will accept that they are necessary for their own safety.

> Should residents forget their identity cards or proof of residence, he said, security guards may follow them to their units for verification.

> ""I'm sure some residents might challenge and say 'you got no powers to do this', but then I guess it's for the good of the majority; the council does something which is in its opinion appropriate,"" he said.

> According to its website, Savills Property Management oversees a portfolio of more than 40,000 units in 135 buildings across Singapore.

> Before the incident at Signature Park, said Mr Chan, some had already asked if people entering condos should be checked.

> As of now, said Mr Chan, there are no plans to implement the same measures at Savills' other properties, acknowledging that they are ""rather draconian and place a lot of responsibility on shoulders of the guards"".

756,11,dyqtnem,t1_dyqr3t1,"It's a combination of factors. Experience and skill in observing your surroundings are very important, but luck is also at play here. There are some species that I haven't been able to cross paths with, or have trouble finding, even though some of my peers spot them fairly often. Sometimes it's random members of the public or people who are less experienced who come across rare animals, and don't realise their significance. For example, the guy who first photographed this Great Slaty Woodpecker didn't know it was something special. If he hadn't posted his photo to one of the local birdwatcher Facebook groups, it's possible nobody would have known about this species reappearing, unless someone else also has an encounter, and documents and shares the finding.

Having said that, levelling up your vision, hearing, and intelligence stats goes a long way. That comes from spending a lot of time outside, with your senses on high alert at all times. If you hear a bird chirping, look up in the trees and find it. Look among bushes and shrubs for insects and spiders. If you spot something rustling in the grass or leaf litter, look out for the movement - it might be a lizard or small snake. It also helps if you follow more experienced people, or join a guided walk. With time, you'll develop the ability to not just identify a fair proportion of what you've seen and heard, but you'll also develop the ability to know what to look out for, which helps if let's say you have a target species to find. It's kind of like identifying Pokemon based on their silhouettes.

Let's face it: urban life means that our eyes and ears are no longer attuned to detect wildlife. It took me years to train my senses to spot animals while I'm outside, and I've still got a long way to go. But once you've managed to reach a certain level, you'll realise that it's often not very difficult at all, and you'll marvel at how n00b you were last time. Right now I'm trying to upgrade myself and learn how to identify some common native plants, and wow it's another whole new challenge. But now that I can confidently identify some of the common species, it's like viewing the same old surroundings with new eyes.

757,11,e4wtpo4,t1_dyqr3t1,"Sorry for the necro, but it really does take a lot of experience and practice - especially in Singapore, where ""rare"" birds are hard to come by. It's often the case that people go down to specific places just to find specific birds. That being said, what I found was most helpful was following certain Singaporean bird photographers on Instagram, and then just seeing which birds you find interesting and visiting the locales if they're geotagged. Asking them for information regarding behavior and timing also helps too. Once you're there, put away all distractions, and let your eyes and ears do the work :) ",t3_8i6nlu,27-08-2018

761,11,dyqlazs,t1_dypbtqy,"The Great Slaty Woodpecker was considered locally extinct, not globally. It's widespread across northern India and much of Southeast Asia, although the most recent global conservation assessment now considers it vulnerable to extinction. 

Whenever a supposed extinct species suddenly pops up in a place where it hasn't been seen for a long time, there are a few possible scenarios:

1) The species never actually disappeared from the area, just that nobody recorded its existence for a long time - a common criterion for a species to be declared extinct is for 50 years to have passed since the last verified sighting / other form of evidence.

Woodpeckers are generally loud and conspicuous birds, and one this size would be pretty hard to miss. Bukit Timah Nature Reserve itself isn't very large, and it's been surveyed by many birdwatchers over the decades. It's quite incredible that this bird could have gone incognito for so long - even without any sightings, so many forest bird species can be easily documented just by paying attention to the calls you hear as you walk along the trails. So as much as I wish that a breeding population has managed to remain hidden for so long, I don't think this is the case here.

2) The species has dispersed from neighbouring areas where it still occurs. We've had similar examples - the Oriental Pied Hornbill, Smooth-coated Otter, and Wild Boar all disappeared from Singapore some time back, after decades without any sightings. Whether they were truly gone or just hanging on in very small numbers in remote areas, nobody knows. Then they started popping up again. Given that the first few records all took place along our northern coastline, it's almost certain that at least the first wave of records represent individuals dispersing from Johor. Once these end up staying in Singapore and breeding, the number of sightings goes up, as we've seen with all 3 species. As Johor continues to develop, it's likely that we're going to get more and more of these 'refugees'. Similarly, although the Large Flying Fox was once resident in Singapore, the roosts have all disappeared; today all the recent records are believed to be occasional visitors from neighbouring countries, possibly dropping by to visit fruiting and flowering trees.

I think this is the most likely scenario for the Great Slaty Woodpecker, since it's present in Johor's forests, and it wouldn't be too implausible for a bird of this size to fly across the Straits of Johor in search of new territory. Geographically, Singapore is a small island just off the coast of Johor, well within flying / swimming range of many creatures. For comparison, Singapore is closer to Johor than Langkawi, Tioman, and Penang are to mainland Peninsular Malaysia!

3) The individual(s) spotted is of captive origins. The Oriental Pied Hornbill population in Singapore is a mixture of wild birds that flew over from Johor and established a breeding population, as well as captive birds reintroduced into the wild to boost the gene pool. And if I'm not wrong, based on some preliminary genetic research, some other birds like the Oriental Magpie-robin and White-rumped Shama, represent a mixture of both native, wild populations, as well as former captives (and descendants of those escapees). The Oriental White-eye is believed to have disappeared due to widespread trapping, only to return after enough individuals escaped to establish a breeding population in Singapore once again. Not surprising, considering that these 3 birds are very popular in the songbird trade, and would have been imported from other parts of Southeast Asia.

Similarly, it's believed that the Sambar deer in the forests around Mandai are descended from zoo escapees, although the zoo hasn't publicly acknowledged this. It's suspicious, since the zoo has Sambar in its collection, they have escaped at least once before, and the simple fact that the wild population is found in the forests around the zoo. It's difficult to know for sure, unless somebody manages to compare the captive and wild sambar and find out whether they're closely related.

It's difficult to prove or disprove unless someone actually comes up and admits that a captive animal got loose, or genetic material can be collected and compared with that from known wild (or extinct) populations in the area, but as the article stated, Jurong Bird Park doesn't have this species in its collection, and it's not like it's popular in the pet trade.

Still, even if this is just a single bird, this is an awesome sighting. My birdwatching friends are really excited about this. Hopefully our forests will be able to host a breeding population of Great Slaty Woodpeckers once again in the years to come. ",t3_8i6nlu,10-05-2018

The caveat for the District 10 property was lodged with URA Realis on April 14, just three days before oil trading giant Hin Leong and its shipping arm, Ocean Tankers, filed for bankruptcy protection on April 17.

Typically, a buyer would lodge a caveat, which is a claim of interest in a property, after exercising the option to purchase.

A Singapore Land Authority search done by ST showed that the 1,856.6 square metre property was held by Mr Lim, also known as O.K. Lim, and his wife, Madam Tan Sook Eng.

The price works out to $1,351 per square foot (psf) on the freehold land area of 19,984 sq ft, according to Realis.

""The $27 million price is fair value because it reflects the current state of the bungalow and its good location near the Sixth Avenue MRT and good schools, as well as the last transacted price of $27.5 million for another bungalow on Second Avenue in August 2018,"" said Mr Samuel Eyo, managing director of Lighthouse Property Consultants.

""The last addition and alteration, which means keeping the shell of the bungalow but adding or removing some structures, was done in 2005. Most GCB buyers will buy and rebuild for themselves,"" Mr Eyo added.

Hin Leong's financial woes have escalated following news of a probe by the Singapore police and increased scrutiny by several regulators. This, after Mr Lim said the firm hid about US$800 million (S$1.14 billion) in losses incurred from futures trading over the years on his orders. The firm also sold a substantial part of the inventory it had used as collateral to secure loans from its banks, according to filings.

The debt-ridden company, which had total liabilities of US$4.05 billion, against assets of US$714 million, as of April 9, withdrew its application for debt moratorium and is now seeking to come under judicial management. Ocean Tankers remains under debt moratorium.

Apart from the bungalow along Second Avenue, Mr Lim also jointly owns a 1,354 sq m bungalow along Third Avenue, with his son, Evan Lim Chee Meng, according to a title search. Mr Evan Lim, who runs Ocean Tankers and is a director of Hin Leong, also owns a District 10 freehold condo at Parc Stevens along Stevens Drive.

The Lims' Third Avenue freehold GCB was purchased for $8.95 million in April 1995, according to real estate portal SRX Property. A neighbouring GCB on Third Avenue was sold in May last year for $18.8 million.

Another 29,716 sq ft GCB at Queen Astrid Park, purchased for $46 million in June 2017, is held by Madam Tan, the elder Mr Lim's wife.

Mr Lim also jointly owns a GCB at Tanglin Hill with his daughter, Lim Huey Ching, who is also director of Hin Leong.

Hin Leong asked for PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Advisory Services to be appointed its judicial manager after several of its bank lenders with large exposure objected to its application for a six-month debt moratorium, according to sources citing documents.

There are 23 banks exposed to Hin Leong for more than US$3.6 billion, including Singapore's big three - DBS Bank, United Overseas Bank and OCBC Bank - which have a combined exposure of at least US$600 million.

More than five strategic investors, including state-owned enterprises, oil majors and oil traders, have expressed interest in exploring any opportunity to invest, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.",t3_g74byo,24-04-2020

> Stomper Sanchindra was hiking with his wife at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve when they spotted what they believed was a fallen branch.

> Not thinking much about it, they stepped closer towards it but was suddenly stopped by a passer-by who recognised that it was actually a king cobra.

> Sachindra told Stomp about the incident that happened on Sunday (Nov 29) at 5pm, and shared his relief that someone had alerted them before it was too late.

> ""My wife and I had never visited Bukit Timah Nature Reserve before. Since it was our first time trekking there, we were excited to enjoy the nature around us,"" Sachindra shared.

> ""When we saw something long on the footpath in front of us, we thought it was just a fallen branch and started to walk closer to it.

> ""Suddenly, a woman shouted at us not to cross as it was a snake. We immediately stepped away from it.

> ""I'm so glad the woman alerted us as one of us could have been bitten by it.

> ""In the end, my wife and I just kept our distance and admired the snake from afar. It was really nice to see such a beautiful animal in the wild.""

> Sachindra added that this incident served as a reminder for everyone to be careful when trekking in such forested areas.

> ""Just keep a lookout and remember to warn those around you if you spot any wild animals at nature reserves,"" he said.

> In response to a Stomp query, Mr Kalai Vanan, deputy chief executive officer of Acres, said: ""The snake in the photo is an adult king cobra that looks to be about 3m long. This beautiful snake is only occasionally sighted in Singapore.

> ""This video is a classic example of how snakes mind their own business if left alone and not provoked.""

> Mr Kalai added that as visitorship to the nature reserves has seen an increase this year, everyone should always be aware and alert when visiting these parks.

> ""We have to remember that we (humans) are the visitors now and it is only when we pay attention to our surroundings can we get to see such beautiful wildlife around,"" Mr Kalai said.

> ""If you encounter a snake or any other wildlife crossing your path, give it space and time to cross or move off. Do not taunt, provoke or shout at the animal.

> ""Photography is fine but please do keep a safe distance at all times.""

843,11,fngm2g9,t3_g1moco,"'Science' of singapore's roads (bitumen/tarmac/black top)....

Every country uses a unique 'blend' of raw materials for their roads, taking into account cost, mileage, availability of materials, weather conditions(humidity, rainfall etc...) and ease of application. Even the type of traffic, vehicles and their corresponding tyres are huge factors. It took us awhile to perfect the current formula. 

We have one of the highest (if not highest) area of paved roads or density of road per square kilometer in the world. And we also have one of the highest rate of road resurfacing and maintenance as well. 

But even with this vast experience of building roads, there is still much to be desired in terms of lane-merging/diverging paths, angle of on/off ramps and a host of other issues. To be fair, scarcity of land available is a major obstacle. 

Back to the topic at hand. Some expressways use a less than ideal blend of materials. This stretch is one of those. There seems to be a higher 'hard' content of gravel and this makes the surface a little more smooth. This is good when you have heavy vehicles as the surface can last longer and handle a higher load but you sacrifice grip, water drainage and higher susceptability to pitting. In this case here, the initial light rain hasn't had time to penetrate under the surface and remains on the surface, making it more slippery. The surface water also has a tendency to lift up and mix with the other debris and impurities on the road surface, further reducing grip. 

In short, reduce speed when you experience the first sign of rain/drizzle on a dry road surface. It is at its' most slippery and hazardeous phase. 

Drive safe out there!",t3_g1moco,15-04-2020

I enjoy navigating the fairly common rapidly-decreasing-radius entries and exits on our expressways and the camber is always off in the corners (which I suspect is done on purpose to deter the cornering speed demons).

Addition: I got asked what 'decreasing radius' in a road looks like. There must have been a time when you were driving on a new section of our local expressway and you needed to exit to a minor road or join another expressway. As you decrease your speed, peel off and try to look through the apex, the path looks long and sweeping (usually gentle left leaning). You maintain your speed. As you continue through the corner, you feel the vehicle's speed and grip is optimized. Then suddenly, in the last 20-30 meters of this bend, the road tightens up (sharp left) and you feel you either have to brake hard and/or steer hard left. Rwd/fwd/awd require different steering/throttle inputs but generally, even if you managed to save it (not exchange paint with retaining wall), you'll feel pretty nub for the rookie mistake.

> Some night trekking enthusiasts in Singapore are claiming that they have caught a glimpse of the fabled Bukit Timah Monkey Man (BTMM).

> According to urban legend, and strictly within the realms of cryptozoology, the BTMM looks like a monkey but is bipedallled.

> It is thought to be about 1m to 2m in height and lives in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.

> Night trekker believes he saw BTMM

> A post on the Night Raiders Facebook page on Dec. 16, 2020 mentioned that an equipment specialist caught sight of the BTMM.

> The specialist, Alfie, was out with a group of people at the nature reserve testing equipment that can capture paranormal activity.

> The photos were supposedly taken in ""split seconds"" just as the BTMM was spotted under a big tree.

> The post only said the photos were taken some time this year.

> The exact venue, time and date were not revealed.

> Alfie said that this BTMM is ""really huge"":

> However, at the end of the post, it was acknowledged that the existence of BTMM remains unverified.

> ""Whether it is, whether you guys think that the photo is genuine or not, it's for your own opinion and imagination.""

> Background

> Sightings of the BTMM have gone as far back as World War II between 1942 and 1945.

> Japanese soldiers in Singapore had supposedly seen the creature.

> In more recent times, people in Singapore not only saw the creature, but supposedly even made contact.

> One account, related by a taxi driver, recounted how a collision occurred between a taxi and the BTMM, resulting in the creature getting injured and running off.

> SINGAPORE - An urban masterplan that will guide Singapore's development in the next 10 to 15 years was formalised on Wednesday (Nov 27).

> Under the gazetted Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Master Plan 2019, the former Bukit Timah Railway Station Staff Quarters and Bukit Timah Fire Station have also been gazetted for conservation, the authority said in a statement on the same day.

> Other initiatives in the plan include revitalising Orchard Road and the central area such as planning for new hotels and homes in the Central Business District; district-level underground plans; and a new 50km Greater Rustic Coast running along the northern coast.

> The gazette concludes the review of the Draft Master Plan 2019, which was exhibited at the URA's premises from March to June this year.

> Highlights in the showcase included a 24km ""green vein"" called the Rail Corridor running through Singapore that will be connected by 2021, as well as an additional 1,000ha of parks and park connectors.

> The corridor will run through the country, connecting Woodlands Regional Centre, which will feature a new agri-food and innovation park, to future housing in Choa Chu Kang, before running through Queenstown down to the Greater Southern Waterfront, a future mixed-use district of over 2,000ha that will extend from Pasir Panjang to Marina East.

> Meanwhile, the former Bukit Timah Fire Station will feature a visitor centre for the nature and heritage attractions in the area. It will also be a central point for the network of attractions with connections to the Bukit Batok Nature Park and the Rail Corridor. The building's heritage will also be showcased.

> The Railway Station Staff Quarters in Bukit Timah will also be conserved to retain its heritage. The quarters, as well as the Bukit Timah Railway Station opposite it, will be refurbished and repurposed with amenities to complement the station's use as a base for community activities.

> More than 25,000 stakeholders and members of the public visited the exhibition during this time to find out more about the proposals, with some 6,000 visitors also signing up for guided tours by URA volunteers and staff.

> To reach out to more residents, regional plans were also exhibited at Waterway Point, Westgate, Junction 8, Our Tampines Hub and Causeway Point from July to August.

> ""Over the past few years, URA has engaged stakeholders, including residents, interest groups, professional institutes, grassroots leaders and advisers, on our plans,"" URA said in its statement.

> It added that the feedback gathered from these stakeholders through focus groups, dialogue, workshops, briefings and exhibitions have helped to shape URA's draft plans.

> ""In particular, stakeholder feedback from these sessions helped to refine the original plans for Kallang River, Jurong Lake District, Farrer Park, Holland Plain and Lorong Chuan, and shape our plans to support the rejuvenation of Orchard Road and the Central Business District,"" the authority said.

> ""The refined plans were subsequently exhibited as part of Draft Master Plan 2019. The early engagement had also allowed planners to update stakeholders on the actions taken prior to the Draft Master Plan 2019 exhibition.""

> Related Story Liang Court site in Clarke Quay to be turned into mixed-use development with 700 apartments

> URA said that suggestions and feedback for the draft plan's proposals were incorporated where appropriate and will be considered as the authority develops detailed plans for future areas.

> The Master Plan 2019 and the Master Plan Written Statement 2019 are available in hard copy at the URA Centre Atrium for public viewing.

> They are also available online at www.ura.gov.sg

> Members of the public with queries or feedback can write to URA at http://www.ura.gov.sg/feedbackWeb/contactus_feedback.jsp

A relatively quiet plot in Bukit Timah, anchored by Spruce the restaurant, could be revived into a mini-Dempsey Hill.

If some developers get their way, the site - home to the recently  conserved 1956 Bukit Timah Fire Station - could house small boutiques  and food establishments.

The idea to somewhat model it as a smaller version of the Dempsey  Hill retail and food enclave came from Mr Andrew Lau, 55, director of  The Yards, a former school turned enrichment hub in Telok Kurau.

He was one of 36 developers, architects, environmentalists and  business owners who visited the 260 Upper Bukit Timah Road site last  Tuesday and Wednesday as part of a recce tour with the Urban  Redevelopment Authority (URA).

The tour follows the URA's call for proposals last month to give the place a new lease of life.

Mr Lau said: ""Apart from making it more like Dempsey, the revamped site should ideally draw on its relationship with nature.""

Submissions for proposals for the Bukit Timah site will close in April.

Entries will be shortlisted and final proposals will have to be submitted later this year.

The site has been submitted by the authorities for an international  competition, called Reinventing Cities, which encourages the sustainable  repurposing of under-utilised spots in a city.

The authorities have laid out several requirements for developers.

For instance, 410 sq m must be set aside within the site for a visitor centre run by the National Parks Board.

 

The place must also serve as an additional recreational node and a  base to explore surrounding attractions such as the Rail Corridor, the  Coast-to-Coast Trail, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Dairy Farm Nature  Park, the Former Ford Factory and Bukit Batok Memorial.

#### [URA masterplan formalised; Bukit Timah Fire Station, Railway Station Staff Quarters gazetted for conservation](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ura-master-plan-formalised-railway-station-staff-quarters-bukit-timah-fire-station)

The winning team will be awarded a tenancy of three years, renewable  by another two equivalent terms, for the interim adaptive use of the  site.

The original eight-year tenancies for Spruce and 19 other tenants  under real estate management services company LHN Group will expire at  the end of the month.

Some of the tenants have accepted an offer to extend their leases to  December so they have more time to relocate. The other tenants comprise  enrichment centres for children, as well as a yoga studio.

The 0.83ha site, which is slightly larger than one football field,  comprises the former fire station, seven three-storey blocks which used  to serve as accommodation for firefighters, and a single-storey  residence for the station master.

The old fire station, which has been vacant since 2005, was  Singapore's fourth after the Central Fire Station and suburban stations  in Geylang and Alexandra. From 2025, the site will be served by the Hume  MRT station on the Downtown Line.

Ms Claire Chan, URA's director of physical planning in Central West  Singapore, said: ""The plot is at the nexus of so many nature and  heritage attractions. The underrated site has great potential to be  transformed into a community node.""

The fire station, which was established in 1956, was once integral in  keeping kampung homes safe from widespread blazes. Then, the station  also served an industrial corridor along Upper Bukit Timah Road, where a  mix of light industry businesses, such as soya sauce factories and car  workshops, operated.

One of the key markers of the site is a six-storey tower.

Heritage blogger Jerome Lim said firemen used it primarily to hang and dry their hoses.

""Unlike today, the hoses of the past were made from natural materials  that required washing and drying to prevent rotting. The structure's  secondary use was that of a watch tower,"" Mr Lim said.

Mr Lau of The Yards said he thinks the tower should be restored to  its original glory as it is a visual marker. He also noted some  challenges in re-adapting the site, including the relatively small units  within the seven blocks.

Mr Yann Follain, 40, founder of architectural design firm WY-TO, who  was also on the URA tour, believes the place has great potential to  reconnect children with nature. Some of his preliminary ideas for the  site include removing some of its driveways and to blanket the area in  greenery.

""There could also be gallery pop-ups of major exhibitions on show in  town to bring art outside of the city-centre. Ideally, there should also  be a cafe, restaurant or bakery,"" he said. ""Conservation is important  for the community memory, and adaptive reuse is a highly sustainable  approach rather than to demolish and consume more energy with the use of  new materials.""",t3_er4emx,19-01-2020

This statement implies a few assumptions: (1) the incumbent expects to retain their power in these areas, so that their plans can be carried out, and (2) the opposition doesn't have adequate power to build/improve infrastructure for their residents if they get elected (and partly because they have no such five-year plans), and (3) if the opposition does win, the residents will have no chance to enjoy these infrastructure.

&#x200B;

According to the [*Sejarah Melayu*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_Annals), Singapore used to be plagued by [swordfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swordfish) attacking the people living in the coastal regions. A young boy named [Hang Nadim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_Nadim) proposed an ingenious solution, to build a wall of banana stems along the coast at the present location of [Tanjong Pagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar). When the swordfish attacked, their snouts were stuck in the stems. With the swordfish problem solved, Hang Nadim earned great respect from the people, but also jealousy from the rulers. The fourth King of [Singapura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Singapura), [Paduka Seri Maharaja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Maharaja), finally ordered his execution, and it was said that his blood-soaked the soil of the hill where he was killed, giving rise to the red-coloured hill.",t3_iwrbxy,21-09-2020

According to Omong Kosong Saya, Singapore used to be plagued by can openers attacking the people living in the atas regions. A young boy named Narcissus proposed an ingenious solution, to build a wall of canned button mushrooms along the canal at the present location of Bukit Timah Road. When the can openers attacked, their low quality blades were stuck in the tin cans. With the can opener problem solved, Narcissus earned great respect from the people, but also jealousy from other canned mushroom suppliers. The fourth most popular canned mushroom supplier, Mili, finally executed their order from NTUC. It was said that mushroom juice soaked the soil of the hill where they were opened. Because of Covid-19, estate cleaning was reduced, giving rise to the tin-covered hill.",t3_iwrbxy,21-09-2020

I actually wrote a song before that is related to this folklore, called [Redhill](https://youtu.be/RXC0vEBBbh0)

I remembered when I was trying to do research for this folklore there wasn't a lot of details depicted in the stories online. Most of them were very short and were from unofficial sources like blogs. So it's really hard to pinpoint an origin, at least for me.",t3_iwrbxy,21-09-2020
