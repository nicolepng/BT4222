That said, I think this part of your statement is very arrogant and narrow minded:""Nope, your freedom ends where it impedes others."" 

Why don't you go north and tell the Malaysians in their own country that the way they are doing things is wrong and you are correct.  The definition of 'impeding others' is subject to a common standards and to a broader context. The logic in some countries seems to be more in the direction where you are allowed to create some level of disorder in exchange for me also being allowed to create some level of disorder when it is my turn. Some communities like it this way and they are perfectly entitled to that.

Does Malaysia do this with perfect fairness? Probably not, but it does not seem to be as transparently unfair as what you have described as going on here. In Singapore, if we reject this logic for some groups, we should reject it for all groups. And vice versa.

One thing to note. I don't think the level of restrictions in Singapore will survive for long if everyone, including our Chinese majority were subject to the strictest form. What will eventually happen is that things will end up having to be relaxed.--hopefully for everyone.",t3_ito76e,16-09-2020

I see nothing wrong with supporting of the manufacturing. Besides, joss paper is cheap. Apparently he interdimensional exchange rate is beyond ridiculous. 

Ashes will be disposed, of course. The amount of ash produced from one stack (as thick as say.. A digit of your pinky) is very little. People actually have personal small bins to burn in that they clear the ashes themselves. Basically just bin it.

I cannot control what other people do. If I had it my way we wouldn't be talking about this. If they want to pile up papers, I cannot do anything. I can only say that I will burn my stack properly.

Think the ancestors have this epic technology where food and material goods (and sometimes maids and servants) can materialise in the afterlife just because they were burnt in a different plain of existence. Pathfinding should be much easier lol.

Alternatively, perhaps you meant that in the real world people find compromises as long as it’s not too onerous on one side to give in, but that actually goes back to the principle I gave.

That’s the problem here. Expectations often do not match reality. Besides, if you expect the mrt to run full speed every day, without even giving it a chance for maintenance as it is undergoing now, then will you be raising your fists at SMRT when a serious breakdown of the mrt system happens again like the last time? 

Early closure for scheduled maintenance is not new - they’ve been doing this for years already. They chose to close early on fridays and Saturday’s when the crowd is least affected, and also close at 11pm which is only an hour or so early. Most people would be home by 11pm. They announce which stations will be affected beforehand as well. Ample time to make provisions on your end to avoid getting caught unaware IMHO. They put up banners at the stations to inform you, posters on every other doors even. Maybe it’s time to put down the phone and look up once in a while to observe your surroundings.",t3_ejy07i,04-01-2020

199,11,fd51wqe,t1_fd4lhje,"basically you are putting the blame on people for not being more aware of maintenance timings. you are also assuming that people should see banners at stations etc. well the trouble is you have to be THERE at the station to actually see signs AT the station. not many people actually visit the stations so frequently that they can be made aware of a few hours notice maintenance.

i get your point, but i do not agree. people DO expect the mrt to be working, because the government has shut down most other options, increasing overpopulation means even more cars on the roads, peak hour is insane. there was a reason why the breakdowns and subsequent maintenance caused such a huge stir, because the population is seriously reliant on one of the only major means of transport around. it NEEDS to be up, and all the ""patience, we are working on it"" campaigns punctuate the point.

the reality is that our mrt needs maintenance during operational hours, and the public announcement for it is bad, leading to plenty of stranded people. this isn't something the commuters need to buck up on, i feel this is something smrt or government needs following up on. i dont know what the solution is, i am not a president scholar earning big bucks, just a lowly earner with an opinion.",t3_ejy07i,04-01-2020

205,11,fd5tpsa,t1_fd51wqe,"sorry, I doubt that they haven't done enough. i live on the NEL and have seen my fair share of such maintenance posters and banners. these go up at least a month in advance, at station exits and gantries. they're about the size of the standard GRC banners, so it's really really hard to miss. if you're a resident in this area, do you really take the train because I cannot see a situation where you'd miss out on the signs. 

furthermore, regular announcements for the upcoming week's maintenance are broadcast often in stations along that particular line. I happen to take the EWL often to get to work and I'd see and hear such banners for the other end of the island as well. perhaps you'd argue that the banners etc are not seen by those visiting friends etc, but how did you get there in the first place to visit? wouldn't you have taken the same form of transportation getting there, when you're returning home from the station?

now perhaps you'd argue that this are just all physically plastered around, but with how is published on both print media (newspapers) and on online media (ST, Mothership, even), I really don't think you have a case here. okay, maybe the elderly wouldn't be tech savvy enough to read it, but remember, there's the huge banners and announcements, in various languages! besides, how many elderly do you see in the picture?

now, moving on, the MRT is supposed to work, yes, but when it doesn't, there are provisions made to fill in the gap. admittedly, I was not one of those affected by *this* particular early closure, but when I was affected by the NEL early closures recently, I found the shuttle buses to be extremely frequent and adequate. sure, it may be a bit slower than the train, but it's not as if there are no alternatives. again, if you were affected, the massive signs and media plastered around would definitely guide you to the appropriate bus stops!

I don't know what background you come from, but to suggest that maintenance during operational hours is a ludicrous idea. examine other forms of transportation - can planes, buses or cars be serviced while in operation? well I sure as hell hope not. maybe you'd claim that this isn't a fair point to point comparison, so let's go with roads then. when there are road works being carried out, will congestion occur if an expressway is completely blocked and disabled? yes, that's what's necessary to keep the tracks serviced! surely you can't be suggesting that we'll just do it in the 2 minutes between every train? 

well, if it can't be done in the operating hours, can't it be done all in the downtime then? of course it can, but how much of it can be done is another issue. well there's 5-6 hours, you'd say, surely that's enough? nope, not enough to get the results that quickly. remember, for maintenance to start and conclude, there has to be certain procedures, which take time. so after all the necessary time spent, what's leftover could be much fewer hours. so that 1-1.5 hour extra could be a massive increase in time for maintenance! 

my point here is that LTA has done enough to get the public informed. at some point, you can't pin the blame on them anymore. I for one think that they're doing a splendid job keeping everyone up to date. if you don't take note of it, the onus is indeed on you. perhaps the efficiency at which they work and the actual quality of work is unknown, but I believe we have to give credit where it's due. these works only affect a small number of weekends (and it's not the super peak weekends of CNY etc, mind you) and we haven't had major incidents so far. sure, the government is lacking in many aspects, but their current handling of the situation isn't one of them.",t3_ejy07i,04-01-2020
206,11,fd754ob,t1_fd51wqe,"Add on to what the other user say, if you look at some other countries, they can shut down  line for 1 week just to do full maintenance.

Wanna know what i searched on Google? “mrt early closure 2020”. That’s it. You can even ask your friends and family. Maybe they watch mediacorp.

Cb first thing I wake up from my nap is this ungrateful asshat whining about scheduled maintenance and overhaul. Fucking tilted, I tell you. You think they suka suka close at 11pm ah. OK ah, close at 12-1AM, normal timing. If like that ah, tmr the first train starts at 7AM from the train depot. All the best ah to those who start work/school. Confirm late.

Now i active aggressive. Bitch.

i also knew my comment would be misread (only happens in singapore subreddit all the time) i am not saying there should be no downtime, maintenance IS needed of course, and yes it is a good compromise to have it an hour early before close. what i am debating with the other guy is that the onus should be on smrt and the gov to have better announcement systems rather than ""GOTCHA"" when u arrive at the train station and find out it's down for maintenance.",t3_ejy07i,05-01-2020

> SINGAPORE: X-ray machines for bags and walk-through metal detectors are more commonly seen at airports, but these security machines will also be used at MRT stations in the event of a real threat to Singapore’s transport network or during periods of heightened security.

> They were tested at one of the exits of the Downtown Line Newton MRT Station on Sunday from 10am to 6pm by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and SBS Transit (SBST) in an emergency preparedness ground deployment exercise called Exercise Station Guard 2018.

> In the exercise, commuters&apos; belongings and baggage were scanned by X-ray machines, and they were also required to pass through walk-through metal detectors before entering the fare gates near Exit A of the station.

> Deputy director for public transport security, Mr Joseph Goh said: ""This exercise conducted together with SBST is part of our regular review of security measures and plans for the public transport network. We want to be able to respond quickly and effectively when there is a real threat. 

> ""We want to take this opportunity to advise commuters to be vigilant, to report any suspicious person or object immediately to the staff or police.""

>        A commuter being checked during Exercise Station Guard 2018 at Newton MRT station on Sunday (Feb 4). (Photo: Ahmad Khan)   

> Each hour, an average of nearly 1,600 commuters pass through that Newton MRT fare gate to the Downtown Line.

> They had to add about 10 minutes of travelling time to their journey because of the security checks.

> But commuters Channel NewsAsia spoke to were generally not too concerned by the added travel time, while acknowledging the checks could have been more efficient.

> Said one student: ""At least it was not really inconvenient for us. It was more for security and safety, so I think the experience wasn&apos;t that bad.""

>        Commuters had their bags checked before their MRT ride at the Newton MRT station during Exercise Station Guard 2018. (Photo: Ahmad Khan)   

> According to Mr Alex Goei, CEO of SBS Transit Downtown Line, the exercise was to test and validate the processes that have been planned in the event of a heightened security alert.

> He said: “Our takeaway from this morning is we will improve on our processes to see how we can get passengers through the bag check in a heightened security alert in minimum time and with as little inconvenience as possible.""

> This is the first such exercise conducted at the Downtown Line and LTA said it will be doing more of such exercises this year.
