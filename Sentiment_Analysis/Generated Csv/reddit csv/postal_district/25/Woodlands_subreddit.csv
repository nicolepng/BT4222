He responds to the name Ruka (Roo-ka) and is extremely affectionate and friendly to people. Doesn't bite at all but like to play with his teeth. He's wearing a harness and leash as in the picture (Blue/Black, leather material for leash).

His eyes are heterochromic (left brown, right blue) and has a distinctive white snout.

If you see him, call out to him then squat down while remaining eye contact. He knows that as a signal to come back through training. Please do not be afraid of him despite his size, he is REALLY friendly and wouldn't hurt a soul.Male Husky11monthsMicrochipped -- Last 4 numbers are 5189

So this happen in vicinity of Woodlands Waterfront not exactly at jetty or anything. It happened near the walkway that you could walk towards the customs from Woodlands Waterfront. Like to the left of the carpark.

I had a few unexplained/paranormal encounters in woodlands before. In fact a few scary stories that I could share if anybody's interested.

Okay back to what happened, so me and my friends were in that walkway area that was otw to customs we were just hanging out there. Also it was close to 12am when it happened.

We were at the pull-up bar area doing pull ups(big surprise) and shit having a good time. 

Most of you probably have not felt the adrenaline rush doing pull-ups at night while facing like the forest. Like you would feel like something is about to pop up if you keep staring for too long and that fear and rush that would let you more pull-ups than you thought you ever could.

So we were hanging out, chatting loudly when from quite a distance away (15m I guess) I saw this lady wearing a white dress with a white hat pushing a baby stroller.

Number 1 thing that came to my mind, it was 12am why the fuck would you be wearing a hat at night?

And this was not some ordinary hat, it was like a bucket hat but only more wider? Like a cowboy hat without all the curls. Anyway, it was designed to keep the sun out.

Number 2 thing that came to my mind, again it's 12am why would you be pushing a baby stroller and bringing your baby for a walk at this timing.

So she came closer and closer. My friends all noticed her but we weren't really looking at her much. As a matter of fact we were looking at what was inside the baby stroller.

Me and all my friends safely say for sure what was inside the baby stroller.

There was no baby inside the stroller. 

It was a baby doll.

She walked past us with her hat covering her eyes, so I couldn't see her face. All I could see was that she was smiling.

Then we were like ""Okay"", and somehow our attention was just fixed on something else.

 Until one of my friends just said ""Nobody gonna talk about what just happened??""

And we were like nah bro let's get in the car and skedaddle. But we confirmed to each other what we saw when we were away from that area.

So my question as what is said in the title. ""Anybody else experienced the same shit?""

EDIT: Some of you were interested in my other experiences so It's in the comments. Sort through the newest comments to find it."

Hi all, as per title, anyone knows of some gyms I can use in the North Area?  


I'm working at Senoko, so I'm wondering if there're any gyms that are nearby/around the vicinity...  


I've looked at Anytime Fitness but is a little turned off at the price since I've missed the pre-sale offer...  


Planning to be able to go to the gym early in the morning (without a car), unless the evening crowds is really small.  


Budget is perhaps $70/month, if the gym is well-equipped.  


Am happy just with SBD setup, and maybe some dumbbells.  


I've also looked through the ClubFitt (too crowded/opens too late), and maybe GymBoxx at CCK but I don't think I can finish a workout and then go to work.  


Staying around Marsiling MRT area.  


Wonder if there're any other options I might have missed. Thanks!"
