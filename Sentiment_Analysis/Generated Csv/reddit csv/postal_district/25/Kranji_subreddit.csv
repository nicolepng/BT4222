Soon though, I'm going to be able to have a break from school and I plan on using it to explore the Kranji area because I heard it has a ton of beautiful places to explore (ie Kranji Marshes) 

I'm still new to this, and I really want to hear your opinions on where I can visit in Kranji to explore nature. If it helps, I'm looking to just explore beautiful bits of... nature (??)

Looking forward to your replies <3"

I just want to ask if anyone knows I can get my pes status changed before reporting date and go for normal BMT? or do I have to report to Kranji and finish BMTC before my pes can be change?
