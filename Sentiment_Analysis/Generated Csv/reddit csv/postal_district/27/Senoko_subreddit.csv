Hi all, as per title, anyone knows of some gyms I can use in the North Area?  


I'm working at Senoko, so I'm wondering if there're any gyms that are nearby/around the vicinity...  


I've looked at Anytime Fitness but is a little turned off at the price since I've missed the pre-sale offer...  


Planning to be able to go to the gym early in the morning (without a car), unless the evening crowds is really small.  


Budget is perhaps $70/month, if the gym is well-equipped.  


Am happy just with SBD setup, and maybe some dumbbells.  


I've also looked through the ClubFitt (too crowded/opens too late), and maybe GymBoxx at CCK but I don't think I can finish a workout and then go to work.  


Staying around Marsiling MRT area.  


Wonder if there're any other options I might have missed. Thanks!"
