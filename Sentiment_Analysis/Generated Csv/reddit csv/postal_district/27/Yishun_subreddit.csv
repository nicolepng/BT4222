My group and i have been playing for ten years in Yishun but the group have been reduced to a handful because of old age/commitments/safety due to yishun. This is my second post on reddit recruiting people to join. [First Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/69wy6u/anybody_interested_in_playing_soccer_yishun/)

Just some info here:

* We will be playing [here](https://imgur.com/a/TNSInzu). Its a open grass field opposite YJC. Just a few blocks from Yishun MRT. And we'll usually gather at **blk 760** before we play.
* Usually we will start at **930am** to **10am** on **Sundays** and play till we are all tired or if the weather is too hot we'll cut it short
* We'll take attendance on **Saturday** and if the head count is **8 or more** we'll proceed with the game on sunday.
* No commitments at all. Just PM me your phone number and i will add you into a whatsapp group. You can RSVP if you're interested or if you're not you can just choose not to reply. But just make sure you turn up if you RSVP!
* Just 2 goal post using small cones, small teams, grass field. Its super casual, not usual futsal style goal post
* We have chinese, malay, indians, young and old playing.
* You can come once to get a feel of it, and if this isn't your cup of tea or prefer playing futsal its fine! You can join us back anytime.
* Recommended to wear soccer boots because it might be slippery sometimes. But if you don't its fine also!
* We haven't had issues with any siao lang so far so no worries.

Looking forward to your PMs!"

I’m looking at moving to Yishun from Queenstown by February 10th. Just found a [movers of Singapore]( https://www.wisemove.sg/) website that helps Singapore's marketplace for furniture removals and home moves. I was wondering if anyone can help choosing the right one, so I can get the best service for the price. Don't have much of a stuff so a van would probably do the work. 

Appreciate any help and experience shared."
