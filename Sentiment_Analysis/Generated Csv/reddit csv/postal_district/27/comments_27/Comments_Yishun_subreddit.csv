Ah, I myself am a fan of the 928 Luck Sar",t3_guhkh3,01-06-2020
65,27,fsjdseq,t1_fsik954,I think it's the shitty straits times compression and their servers that this was from. And probably intentionally so that people don't have a good quality version of the image that they can use for anything commercial.,t3_guhkh3,01-06-2020
66,27,fsitzhi,t1_fsin34y,"On a regular camera, you slap an ND filter on the lens, and set it to take long exposures, of a couple of minutes typically. Lightning works like a camera flash, so the sensor isn't picking up much until it happens. Do this say, a hundred times during a heavy storm and you'll get a number of keepers.    

You can also use a ""bulb"" mode where you keep the shutter open until you ""tell"" the camera to shut it via a remote control - you do this after the lightning strike.     

If you have an Olympus camera, they have this awesome feature (I have no idea why no one else has copied it, they have a couple of killer features like this that I really wish my camera had), called light composition, where it's all processed in camera and all you have to do is sit back and watch the lightning.        

Once you've got all those photos, you're gonna do some rough adjustments, things like white balance etc, just to make sure it's consistent, and then you'll do what's call exposure blending. This is where you layer all the pictures over each other, and choose which one you will bring to the ""front"", using brushes, luminosity masks (Selecting light and dark areas of the picture). Some of this can be automated, but to do a good job, you can't really.     

After you have a composition you're happy with, you're gonna get in their with the digital brush and dodge and burn, aka lighten and darken selective areas of the photo. This is the time you're also going to play with saturation, local contrast and hue adjustment (the above photo has been worked damned hard from a colour perspective).     

After that, your global adjustment, curves and the like, noise reduction etc, any gradient adjustments might happen at this stage too, and then you'll process the image.     

That's a rough outline, some people would do more, some less, others might do things in different orders etc, but you get the idea.",t3_guhkh3,01-06-2020

69,27,fskcb8c,t1_fsjdseq,"Yeah. There goes any potential of using it as a desktop, tablet, or phone background… (at least for me)",t3_guhkh3,01-06-2020
70,27,fsiwm7v,t1_fsitzhi,"To my knowledge, this shot was actually taken with Live Comp on an Olympus camera.

Unfortunately it was simplified in the story to being shot in a 'long-exposure mode': it would not be possible to capture this many lightning strikes (which would occur over a long period of time, probably an hour for this image) in a single long exposure without overexposing the majority of the image.

If you'd like to do this, your best bet is to use an intervalometer and take a series of shots at a shorter exposure duration (maybe 5-10s depending on foreground brightness and intensity of lightning), and then stacking them in photoshop.",t3_guhkh3,01-06-2020

Does it need to be a DSLR or MIrrorless? If my smartphone can take long exposure and I mount it on a tripod, can?",t3_guhkh3,01-06-2020
73,27,fsjefbd,t1_fsiwm7v,"Yup. This is also correct. Maybe the Olympus camera has an auto mode that allows you to do this but if you don't have an ND filter available, you can use the intervalometer option to get the job done. 

I did a basic multi exposure off my balcony once using my phone as an intervelometer and processed it slightly differently, to look more comic book style a-la Sin City. [Here's the shot.](https://i.imgur.com/rnCSSSJ.jpg)",t3_guhkh3,01-06-2020

if i see a stranger in my property sitting on the bed of my drowsy naked wife, yeah, i think a few punches will not suffice... in the US it is not uncommon to even shoot at trespassers, now we are not US and even i think that it is excessive

288,27,e6bb5zo,t1_e6ba47h,"i am honestly shocked to find anyone supporting the verdict. 
maybe that is why our law system appears so deranged on reddit

first and most importantly what the wife believes or does is completely irrelevant. i thought it is a very common understanding, perhaps not as much so in singapore based on your comment, if the woman is drowsy there can be no consent. heck, man or woman if they are drowsy they cannot consent as much as they cannot be relied on to identify danger.

yes, if there is an intruder in my house and my wife is drowsy and naked in bed i will most definitely fracture his eye socket and chip his teeth. heck, the fact there is a random dude in my room is already suspicious enough, now you have a drowsy naked wife and hes sitting on the bed? ok im not a genius but safe rather than sorry!

now, when i read the article there was no mention of apology and i dont think it should factor into his sentence either, much less compensation. if someone trespasses in such a shady manner, my response will not be to ask why they are trespassin but to knock them out. im not a trained MMA, i have to take you down asap or else id bet ill lose a fight against someone obviously sufficiently trained and experienced in whatever shady trespassing business. fracturing an eye socket is probably the minimum of power otherwise he could easily retaliate and knock me out

i do agree from a humanistic approach he could have apologized and paid for his medical care upon realizing it was a misunderstanding. but, from a legal perspective, he did everything right. if you don protect yourself and your family, do you want the burglar to knock you out first? 

actually it should be completely opposite, if you are saying the guy and his wife has history, then yes, the man should be trialed more carefully for premeditated assault. did he know of her cheating, did he plan to hurt he man because of he was sleepin with his wife? then yes he should be jailed because his use of force is now related to tryin to take the law into his own hands. 

until that is proven, this is simply self defence. in other less safe countries, you can be shot in self defence jus for trespassing. singapore is safe, a fractured orbit is probably more than fair.",t3_9hcpnb,20-09-2018

295,27,e6bg0lc,t1_e6bb5zo,"Your view on this issue is far too simplistic. Law is a social contract between the state and all individuals in the state. In exchange for not doing the things the state says you shouldnt do, the state will protect you from others seeking to perform such act and punish them appropriately. 

Lets go through the sequence of events here. 

- Man1 comes home sees wife topless with Man2 sitting on his maritial bed. 

- Man1 proceeds to attack Man2 who did no retaliate 

- wife intervene and explains it is a misunderstanding 

- man1 gets friend, see man2 and tries to attack him again, friend stops man1

-Wife intervene again and says misunderstanding

In this case the act is Battery. The unlawful use of physical violence. The judge is responsible for making a judgement that as much as possible, adhere to the social contract while at the same time let it serve as a detterent for further such incidents. 

Remorse is the key factor in the decision here. The law does not care whether you THINK you are right or wrong. What they care is whether you give a shit about the social contract that is the law or not. If you care enough about the law, you are expected to know how stringent we are, you did techinically commited a crime, cause harm and breached the contract. Lack of remorse indicates that you do not care about this contract and have not much intention of following it. In other words, a lack of respect for the law and the wellbeing of your fellow man. This makes you derelict in your fufilment of the social contract and the judge will have zero incentive in being lenient with you.
 
Also, lets say the judge does not punish this man. What message does it send? That a man can beat up another person just because he ""lost it"" and face no repurcussions?  In law precedents can be used in future cases. This time is just a fractured eye socket and loose teeth. What if next time it is paralysis and the man goes free? So as long as a man ""lost control"" he can inflict any harm and is not accountable for it? A message must be sent, a man who disregard law and harms others will be punished even if the reason appears justifiable.

You also seem to think violence is the only solution is many instances. Please, never be quick to violence. Take this from some1 who did martial arts for years. Once you throw the first punch, things can escalate really fast. Before you know it, one of you might find a screwdriver stuck in your guts. Or one of you might take a fall and hit your head against a sharp edge of the table. No matter how much you train, a fight is never worth it. Especially not in Singapore. If you find yourself in a confrontation, talk, de-escalate the situation. Or run. Only when you have absolutely no choice you fight. 

Also, if somebody is doing shady business you can expect them to be armed in some way. Even trained experts never mess with someone with a knife. So really, dont try.",t3_9hcpnb,20-09-2018

> While the majority of us are confined to our homes during the Circuit Breaker, barely seeing or even speaking to our neighbours, it would not hurt to look out for each other during this time of need—especially for older folks or those who live alone.

> For the case of Huang, he had unintentionally discovered a stench emanating from his neighbour’s flat in Yishun for over two days.

> It was only when the smell intensified did he contact the police immediately on 7 May, as told to Lianhe Wan Bao during an interview. 

> Authorities were said to have received the report on 7 May at 1.50pm. The police arrived at the scene and found a woman, Weng Hui Qiong, lying near the entrance of the living room with her face facing up—her body already decomposing.

> Medical personnel pronounced the 60-year-old dead on the spot in light of the body’s “blackened” state and ruled it as a case of unnatural death. 

> Weng’s daughter, reportedly 30-year-old had been by her mother’s decaying body and did not seem to have realised that her elderly mother passed away. 

> 60-year-old elderly mother passed away at her home. Her daughter stayed by her decomposing body for 5 days. | Photo: SRX

> Both mother and daughter lived in Block 704 Yishun Ave 5, according to Lianhe Wan Bao. The pair had been living here for around 30 years, said Huang. 

> It was said that Weng’s daughter did not know how to report the incident to the police, and did not dare to leave the flat. She accompanied her mother’s decaying body for around 5 days. 

> Prior to her death, Weng had been working as a coffee shop staff who collects used dishes. However, she had stopped working after the Circuit Breaker was implemented.

> A couple of neighbours who were interviewed by Lianhe Wan Bao said that they had not seen the mother-daughter pair leaving their homes for about four to five days prior to Weng’s death.

> Huang commented that while Weng’s daughter is likely to be over 30-years-old, she still behaves like a child. He also noted that she has “low IQ” and often walks around hugging a doll.

> “I am not sure if she knew what had happened to her mother. Even after the police told her that her mother had passed away, she did not respond.”

> Another neighbour who goes by Mrs Tan lamented that the family is “poor” and “are very pitiful” to Lianhe Wan Bao.

> Tan also noted that both mother and daughter appear to have some mental problems. Even so, she said that Weng would still “greet and chat with neighbours and is still able to go to work”. 

> On the other hand, the daughter’s condition seem to be more severe, only following her mother when she leaves home but never utters a word. 

> While neighbours did not divulge much about the family, it was made known that Weng’s husband was deceased and did not live with his wife and daughter. 

> Thus far, 6 relatives have come to identify and claim Weng’s body in preparation for mortuary procedures. 

> Investigations are currently ongoing.

Under the Mental Capacity Act, a person lacks mental capacity if they are: “unable to make a decision for himself in relation to the matter because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain.” ...

Condolences to the family for this tragedy. 

I used to drink and drive all the time in the US when the DD laws were a joke there. Then the law changed and it literally made me quit drinking forever. Went in for a DD, judge said ""I sentence you to 1 year in LA county"" Judge hits gavel, pauses 20 seconds... ""suspended"". Longest 20 seconds of my life. 

In other words if I got into anymore trouble in the next 3 years I would automatically do the 1 year (on top of the new charge). I still did 14 days in LA county (pretty hardcore) but that's all. Sober 24 years now. 

For anyone who thinks increasing the penalty doesn't result in change, I respectfully disagree.

I wish I could say I realized my mistake and then quit, but no, it was the threat of a long term sentence. I'm very lucky I didn't kill someone during that period of my life.  I couldn't live with myself now. ",t3_a9f47o,26-12-2018

Thankfully the dog owner has contacted me! Thanks to this awesome community for always ready to help out ◡̈

Not sure where else I can post this but hoping this can make a difference! We found this cute little lost dog right outside my house corridor. Asked around the neighbours but this dog does not belong to them.

Unfortunately, we are unable to house this dog and we have to call the AVS to come collect the dog so that it doesn't wander any further. 

If you so happen to be the owner of this dog, please kindly PM me so that I can refer to you the case number given by AVS so you can collect back your dog.

792,27,e60txa2,t3_9fy65m,"I saw this recently too, there was a case of a similar looking dog who went lost last two years ago and last seen at yishun but a day or so later found in woodlands. So u can see how far a dog can travel in a short span of time and sometimes they can’t be found in the same town. I really fear for these dogs as that last one i saw was walking across roads with cars stopping for its sake. 

My friend and i tried to follow it but alas it was too quick plus we had our own dogs with us. So many nasty scenarios filled my mind that night, what would happen to these animals.... 

My advice to people is, always put an extra collar on your dog in case it goes missing, secondly both hands on the leash for singapore specials (since they have a reputation for escapism due to not being desensitized to noise and visual stressors). Of course these can happen to any dog just that SS are more prone to it. If u feel unsafe then a second leash tied to a belt on your waist can help put u at ease if your dog is really flighty. 

All in all I hope they find this dog, drive around and ask around I’m sure people have seen it somewhere. A dog running around in populated parts of singapore isn’t easy to miss well unless in hiding. ",t3_9fy65m,15-09-2018

> Officers burst into an illegal drug lab and arrest suspects before a HazMat team decked out in orange suits moves in to contain the scene.

> This may seem like something out of a movie, but it unfolded here on Dec 6 last year, in what is believed to be the first suspected case of drug manufacturing in Singapore in recent years.

> The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) raid, supported by the Singapore Civil Defence Force and Health Sciences Authority, resulted in the arrest of two men, aged 40 and 45. The authorities also seized 2.6kg of synthetic cannabis and 500g of an ""unknown powdery substance"".

> A CNB spokesman told The Straits Times that there have been no drug manufacturing cases here in ""recent years"". ""Singapore&apos;s zero-tolerance stance on drugs and our vigorous enforcement actions served as an effective deterrent in keeping such nefarious activities out of Singapore,"" he added.

> If convicted of unauthorised manufacturing of a Class A controlled drug, the pair arrested in the Dec 6 raid each face at least 10 years&apos; jail and five strokes of the cane.

> When ST visited the industrial unit where the drugs were believed to have been made, neighbours said they did not suspect a thing and had hardly interacted with the employees there. A sign on the door indicated that the unit housed a ship supplies company.

> The management of the industrial building in Yishun Industrial Street 1 declined to comment, and attempts to contact the unit&apos;s owner went unanswered.

> 2.6kg

> Weight of synthetic cannabis seized in the raid.

> 500g

> Weight of an ""unknown powdery substance"" also seized in the raid.

> Mr Wu Jia Wei, 30, a partner of a cleaning company next to the unit, was shocked to discover what had allegedly been going on just next door: ""There was no strange smell, no unusual noises. It was actually very quiet.""

> Lawyer Amarick Gill, who has been practising law for 20 years, said: ""(Drug) cases are usually possession, consumption, trafficking or importation of drugs. I&apos;ve never come across a case of manufacturing before.""

> Typically, drugs are made in other countries, and traffickers or abusers are caught when they try to bring them into Singapore, he said.

> ""The Tuas and Woodlands checkpoints are the usual points where drugs are intercepted before they reach our shores. Traffickers or abusers are also caught during spot checks or when the authorities act on tip-offs,"" he added.

> Synthetic cannabis, also known as synthetic cannabinoids, is classified as a new psychoactive substance (NPS) and is a Class A controlled drug.

> It is sometimes referred to as ""spice"" or ""K2"" and is usually packaged as dried plant material laced with fragrances and spiked with a synthetic cannabinoid.

> While its molecular structure differs from the active molecule in the cannabis plant, synthetic cannabis acts on the same receptors in the brain to create a similar effect, said Dr Too Heng Phon, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore&apos;s biochemistry department.

> Traffickers manufacture these sorts of drugs in many countries, said sociologist Stella Quah. ""It is typically done in improvised hidden labs... as they find it increasingly difficult to avoid police surveillance when they try to bring illicit drugs into the country.""

> Professor Quah, an adjunct professor at the Duke-NUS Medical School, noted that it has become a trend elsewhere for addicts to try manufacturing illegal drugs, although such activity is difficult to hide in Singapore.

> But there is the threat that the manufacture of these new kinds of homemade drugs might spread here because of the availability of information online, she noted.

> ""Drug users might be deceived into thinking that it is easy to do so.

> ""The dangers of &apos;cooking drugs&apos; at home and consuming them range from the serious risks of handling volatile chemicals without protective gear and equipment, to injecting or consuming cheap, non-purified hazardous substances.""

> Dr Edmund Tian, domain lead of chemistry testing at Temasek Polytechnic&apos;s School of Applied Science, noted that the quality of such drugs may not meet pharmaceutical standards and ""are often contaminated with synthetic by-products and derivatives originating from inefficient synthetic processes"". ""These chemicals could be even more toxic to humans.""

> He added that cardiovascular problems and psychological disorders like panic attacks are among frequently reported symptoms of NPS.

> Dr Too warned: ""Synthetic cannabis can contain other highly toxic substances with its chemical make-up varying from batch to batch. You never know what&apos;s inside.""

In statistics, many statistical tests calculate correlations between variables and when two variables are found to be correlated, it is tempting to assume that this shows that one variable causes the other. That ""correlation proves causation,"" is considered a questionable cause logical fallacy when two events occurring together are taken to have established a cause-and-effect relationship. This fallacy is also known as cum hoc ergo propter hoc, Latin for ""with this, therefore because of this,"" and ""false cause."" A similar fallacy, that an event that followed another was necessarily a consequence of the first event, is the post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin for ""after this, therefore because of this."") fallacy.

For example, in a widely studied case, numerous epidemiological studies showed that women taking combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) also had a lower-than-average incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), leading doctors to propose that HRT was protective against CHD. But randomized controlled trials showed that HRT caused a small but statistically significant increase in risk of CHD. Re-analysis of the data from the epidemiological studies showed that women undertaking HRT were more likely to be from higher socio-economic groups (ABC1), with better-than-average diet and exercise regimens.

869,27,ds8kp15,t1_ds7zxbe,"very nasty shit. ""Spice"" or ""K2""'s effects are very serious and damaging. and there isn't one 'recipe' to make it, so it could contain any number of random compounds, depending on the manufacturer. These could be toxic - extremely potent compounds that cause serious, amplified side effects or even death. Those effects do not happen with natural cannabis, and there have been no recorded death due to natural cannabis consumption. 

This is a serious issue because impressionable people looking for a thrill might think synthetic cannabis sounds 'safer'. Also 'Spice' is legal in many places where actual cannabis is not, so people might infer that it is safer to ingest 'Spice' than cannabis.

The police cannot arrest the person immediately also, unless they see him red-handed assaulted you. So in the meantime, the guy is free to go.

953,27,fhdx47d,t1_fhdl79z,"One action can have several charges that are applicable to it. Let me cite an example, say a man punched you in the face. This is Voluntarily Causing Hurt under the Penal Code which is non-arrestable (I.e. SPF cannot arrest you without a warrant of arrest). If you punch the man back, this becomes Affray under the Penal Code where there must be an element of exchange of punches and this is an arrestable offence. Now, even if it’s just a clear cut case of you getting punched in the face, it depends on the severity of the injury. If the hurt is grievous as defined under the Penal Code, it becomes an arrestable offence and you don’t have to prove that it is grievous, as long as there is reasonable suspicion that is sufficient grounds for arrest. Moving on, the man can be arrested under the Mental Health Care and Treatment Act for being of unsound mind, he can also be arrested under the Liquor Control Act for causing annoyance to any persons whilst drunk, he can also be arrested for disorderly behaviour under the Miscellaneous Offences Act, he can be arrested for public nuisance under the Penal Code, he can also be arrested for breach of peace under the Criminal Procedure Code. In short, there is a plethora of powers that the SPF can use to arrest the person, it is not just VCH and now SPF cannot do anything. The police is here to keep the peace and prevent further escalation, they are not your babysitter. You can go ahead and lodge a magistrate’s complaint against the defendant after going for a medical checkup and claim from the defendant through court process after which the defender shall face the charge of VCH.",t3_f2lbkh,12-02-2020

965,27,fhg78xq,t1_fhdx47d,"It does not work like that.

1. If you punch someone in the face (VCH) and this is seen by a Police Officer, you will be arrested on the spot. Same with fighting or affray in the presence of a Police Officer. Police do not arrest just based on a report. The cases of affray charged in court that reported in the press are the ones where a member of public called 999 and the people are still fighting when the Police arrive at the scene and they see the fight.
2. Causing grievous hurt is where there is a fracture or the injuries are serious enough to hospitalised someone for a considerable time. Again there has to be an investigation unless it occurred in the presence of an Officer. No need for Magistrates consent. 
3. For VCH and some minor crimes, procedures requires you going for medical  examination for which the Police will provide the form (free) and an advice form to lodge a magistrate' complaint. Most people lodge police reports in the heat of the moment but do not bother to go thru the process. This was done during colonial times to stop abuse of power by the Police who might be friends with one party. Bear in a mind a Senior Police such as an ASP and above can authorise an investigation without going to a magistrate where public interest is concerned. They do this if you rush into a field while a football game is on and punch the referee - VCH. Police will arrest and charge you after clearance from the Senior Officer.",t3_f2lbkh,13-02-2020

> SINGAPORE - He was a sensible and mature boy who loved his family and friends deeply.

> But on Thursday (Feb 4), Jethro Puah, 15, a student from Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), died after an accident at Safra Yishun.

> The police said he lost his footing during a high-element activity at about 2pm on Wednesday and was ""suspended by the safety harness"" in mid-air.

> He died on Thursday morning in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH).

> In a statement to The Straits Times on Friday, Jethro's family said he was an only child who was among the top in class academically, and was also a caring friend who prayed for those around him when they were going through difficult times.

> ""He was a loving son, an exemplary student, a caring friend and a class chairperson,"" said the statement.

> ""He has lived such an impactful and fruitful life. Short as it may be, more importantly, it was very purposeful and completed.""

> His parents said they would always do things together as a family.

> ""It's hard to let go because we had such a close bond with Jethro,"" they said.

> ""More than a son, he was a close friend who communicated openly and we mutually supported one another in the family unit. We know this is not a goodbye, as we will see him again in our heavenly home.""

> Speaking to the media outside the wake at Singapore Casket in Lavender Street, his aunt, Madam Betsy Lee, in her 70s, said Jethro was musically inclined.

> ""I remember him singing hymns so beautifully, and he had an excellent tenor voice,"" she said. ""He also enjoyed playing the violin and guitar.""

> More on this topic Related Story Schools suspend activities involving heights after ACS(I) boy's death at Safra Yishun

> Mrs Jessy Oskar Kwok, a family friend, said Jethro was very mature for his age.

> ""While other teens were staring at handphones in social gatherings, Jethro would reach out genuinely to engage others and ask how they were doing,"" she said.

> ""He was exceptionally mature and thoughtful for this age.""

> The family has requested privacy, and said they were still in shock and grieving.

> Jethro had lost consciousness while suspended in the air, and paramedics from the Singapore Civil Defence Force tried to resuscitate him at the scene before taking him to KTPH.

> He was taking part in the school activity organised by Camelot, an outdoor adventure learning company, which is now assisting in investigations.

Personally, having stayed in Woodlands for over 20 years, it has been pretty terrible for me. I wasted so much of my life commuting. 

Plus food scene here is so sad. Made worse when they tore down the old Woodlands market. And if you stay on the other side where there are no hawker, with mostly food courts in neighbourhood malls, food is also generally more expensive than hawker in mature estates. 

But if you have a car, Woodlands is about equal distance to most places in SG. Almost everywhere is 30-40 mins. That's good. But at the same time, it's equally far to most workplaces, unless you work in the north. 

People love saying ""Woodlands good, go JB near"". Having been chased by gangsters there when I was younger (during sec sch) multiple times and know some of my friends who frequent there got extorted and some got car stolen or broken in, I have no love for that place. I don't even think my woodlands friends goes to JB often tbh. I have so many horror stories of Johor, it's not even funny.

1102,27,g2ovkql,t1_g2npytr,"Student: a number of tables to study at (esp in the basement), BBT (iTea & LiHo) + many other f&b outlets, multistory library. Also teoheng. 

Sports: the area was originally a sports complex, so it makes sense the mall has them since it was supposed to be a renovation of these facilities but evolved into a full fledged mall with these features integrated into the layout. So there’s an indoor running track, badminton/TT halls, swimming pools, football field etc. There’s laser tag. And obviously all the sport stores are there too. 

Community: a lot of screenings/live performances. I don’t think there’s ever been a time (pre-covid) I’ve gone there in the evening and there isn’t some movie being screened or a performance. During world cup they also did match screenings there with some really nice looking cushion chairs (altho up to you to lie on something a lot of ppl have probably been on lol). Also has a pretty nice and big Public Service Centre (PSC) for settling gov stuff. 

Families: sports facilities aside, also got like those childcare etc in the basement iirc. Fairprice for grocery shopping. The hawker centre is one of those social enterprise ones so meals are very cheap, and there’s a lot of options. There is a theatre there that [screens a few current movies for a low price](https://i.imgur.com/GuiKUOv.jpg) ($6 if you watch on a weekday with OTH passion card, $9 for weekend), altho there’s no online booking [obv this isn’t open now, thanks covid]. 

Not to mention the location, it’s very near Tampines MRT. The walk to the mall is sheltered. 

Walking around in the mall itself feels very open and breezy thanks to all the bigassfans and the design of the mall. 

Go there and check it out :)",t3_if61ux,24-08-2020

1132,27,du39y3a,t3_7wr8xv,"Honey buzzards are seriously badass. They feed on all sorts of smaller creatures, such as lizards and frogs, mice, large insects such as grasshoppers and cicadas, and occasionally small birds, but they get their name because their main prey consists of bee and wasp larvae.

That's right, they actually [attack bee and hornet nests](http://www.besgroup.org/2008/10/11/oriental-honey-buzzards-attack-bees-nest/). Honey badger don't care? Honey buzzard [seriously DGAF](http://www.besgroup.org/2008/11/12/oriental-honey-buzzard-attacking-wasp-nest/).

The honey buzzard has thick skin on its legs, and the feathers on its face are small, dense, and overlapping, almost like armour, to reduce the risk of getting stung by angry bees and wasps while it's raiding the nest. It will either use its talons to [break off chunks of the nest](http://www.besgroup.org/2016/01/04/oriental-honey-buzzard-taking-off-with-a-piece-of-honeycomb/) and fly off, or repeatedly assault the nest until it manages to [break into the cells where the larvae are](http://www.besgroup.org/2012/05/27/oriental-honey-buzzard-in-action/), all this while swarms of angry bees or wasps are flying around, trying to sting it.

[Here's a video](https://youtu.be/pT6atllotI4) of an Oriental honey buzzard attacking a hornet nest.

And [here's another video](https://youtu.be/X5ashdr9Kmw) showing an Oriental honey buzzard picking at some honeycomb while ignoring all the honeybees flying around it.

The Oriental honey buzzard has 2 distinct populations; there's a northern population that breeds in places like Russia, Japan, and northern China, migrates to India and Southeast Asia during the winter, then flies back north when spring arrives. Most of the Oriental honey buzzards we see in Singapore will be winter visitors from this northern population; [large numbers](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/migration-of-juvenile-oriental-honey-buzzards-over-central-singapore/) pass through Singapore during the migration season. We also get some juveniles that don't fly back north and [stay in the tropics](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2015/08/27/summering-oriental-honey-buzzards-in-singapore/) during summer. 

There is also a resident southern population of Oriental honey buzzard that stays all year-round in the tropics, and breeds in India and Southeast Asia; these look quite different from their northern cousins. They're known to breed in Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra, but not in Singapore, although we do get individuals from these southern populations flying over and visiting us from time to time.

It' been nearly 3/4 years since e-scooters have been around and the best solution the government can come up with is a ban. If say for the past 4 years, the government has linked up the cycling paths between different areas it wouldn't have been as bad and the ban can be considered as fair. But so far Singapore doesn't have the infrastructure to support the ""car-lite"" society that it tries to push a few years back. Have the cycling infrastructure improved these past few years? Most probably. But the real question is, does it look like 4 years of development? Our government likes to pride itself in foresight. Doing difficult work to make sure we progress as a country. It's been less so recently. Like some here, I feel that so far policies thought out are reactive and shows an unwillingness to have an actual discussion or plan.

&#x200B;

I find it amusing that some of my friends are telling delivery riders to blame errant riders instead of the government and pedestrians. On the other hand I have friends who are delivery drivers that blame pedestrians for the current situation. There were already laws banning the modification of e-scooters, there is a speed limit imposed on e-scooters, there is a weight limit and the battery must be certified. Did it work? Obviously not. These guys were already breaking the law. Once the hoo-ha dies down, guess what is going to happen next? These guys will still break the regulation, ride on footpaths, modify their e-scooters and do whatever they want. What is needed is good enforcement or actual licensing/training along with a good deterrent.

&#x200B;

This sudden ban feels like it's a panic ban lack of forethought. Maybe when Japan banned e-scooters on footpaths, our leaders decided to follow despite Japan having better cycling infrastructure overall. Or maybe elections are coming.",t3_dsy4a5,07-11-2019

> CNB officers on Tuesday evening intercepted a car driven by a 22-year-old suspected drug offender near Yishun Street 11, just as it was about to exit a car park.

> As officers moved in to arrest the suspect, CNB said he put up a “violent struggle and necessary force was used to subdue him"". A search of his car found about 1.4kg of heroin, S$12,600 in cash and a knuckle duster.

> 

> The man was then brought to his residence nearby, where about 2,100 Ecstasy tablets, 4,100 Erimin-5 tablets, 6g of ketamine and 22g of Ice were found.

> “Drug paraphernalia such as improvised smoking apparatuses, a digital weighing scale, and cash of S$9,000 and RM912 were also found in the unit,” said CNB.

> 

> A separate team of CNB officers raided a home near Yishun Avenue 9 where they arrested a 21-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man, and seized 14 Ecstasy tablets and 43g of cannabis.

> 

> The man was taken to his residence where officers found 3g of Ice, 2,362g of heroin and 12 Ecstasy tablets.

> Officers also recovered a Karambit knife and a stun device during the search. A 23-year-old woman was also arrested when she returned to the unit.

> CNB said the 3.76kg of heroin seized is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 1,790 abusers for a week.

> 

> “Despite the current challenging situation, CNB will continue to carry out enforcement operations to ensure that the streets are safe from drugs.”

I had been a ""Woodlander"" since birth, but after I left Singapore for studies and work opportunities my old flat is reconstituted as ""Marsiling,"" and a separate entity from the rest of the ""hip and cool"" Woodlands.

When I was growing up, ""Marsiling"" was a neighbourhood that overlooked the Woodlands Checkpoint and the connecting Admiralty Road West (before Woodlands Waterfront made it popular again, this was a sleepy part of Singapore that was ignored by the hustle and bustle of the ever-changing development that happened elsewhere). The former Si Ling Secondary served as a schooling ground for people of that area. People who lived in this general area (see Google Maps for the roads named ""Marsiling"") don't generally have a reputable status owing to the old and ageing population that lived there, as well as how [Si Ling was notorious previously for being a haven for gangsterism](https://fionaseah.com/tag/si-ling-secondary-school/) so it comes to mind that the denizens there are also generally less well-off and secretly troubled (they are not *as troubled* as Yishun, though).

I’ll just write my impression of things, tbf everything has a min-max. While rightfully so because realistically given how Singaporean’s are so prone to complaining... tough to handle every bloody complain or report.

That being said there are obviously hard limits and spf will rain fury, drug related offences? Yep. Killing? Sure. Insinuating mockery of something? Oh yeah. However in a way the police also kind of acts as a mediator or middle-man of some sort, like if neighbours too noisy after 10pm, I’d probably call the police and let them settle it. 

50 reports is a really big number for any offense. Really, there should probably be an escalation of some sort by the time it hits a dozen. 

My impression is in this case the police behaves like a ... mediator? Maybe the law didn’t adequately cover this area, maybe spf did not look at the entire list of reports and realise the gravity of the situation or maybe things fell through the cracks. I’m pretty sure if I make a report for the fiftieth time I’ll make sure the officer knows, in high pitch Singlish probably also.

> SINGAPORE - The police have arrested a 64-year-old woman who allegedly robbed a blind tissue seller at an underpass near Yishun MRT.

> On May 1, Facebook user Jessica Vincent posted photos of a tissue seller and a person who she claimed was the thief.

> In her post, Ms Vincent said that the tissue seller, who was seated on the floor in the photo and who she said was blind, had been robbed around 7.20pm at Yishun MRT the day before.

> According to Ms Vincent, a thief had snatched the tissue seller's bag of earnings for the day and run off.

> She said that after the tissue seller shouted for help, another woman chased after the thief but failed to stop her.

> Ms Vincent said that she would make a police report, and added: ""This poor blind lady has been sitting (for) probably the whole day... how could any human to do this despite how poor one can be?""

> On Thursday (May 9), the police said that they received a report on the incident around 3pm on May 2.

> After conducting ground enquiries, officers from Woodlands Police Division established the identity of the woman and arrested her in the vicinity of Woodlands Street 12 on Wednesday.

> If found guilty of theft, she may be jailed for up to three years, fined, or both.

Stop creating straw man arguments that no one’s even put forth - it’s intellectually disingenuous. You came in here trying to falsely conflate the idea that a lack of compassion with this fuckwad who fell to his death and a lack of human rights. Hate to break it to you, but the lack of respect for idiots who die due to their own foolish actions has nothing to do with human rights, nor is it even a uniquely Singaporean thing. Hell, have you even looked up the Darwin awards? Evidently not, or else you wouldn’t even be putting forth such an ignorant statement. I don’t even disagree with you - sure, Singapore needs to reform some of its more draconian laws. But don’t you dare think for a second that I somehow need to feel compassion for this dumbfuck who died in a particularly stupid manner in the basis of “human rights”, which isn’t even relevant to the situation at hand.",t3_bhw3f8,29-04-2019
1916,27,em22e7b,t1_em1yoww,"""no one gives a fuck"" well that's exactly the point.

Darwin awards are not made by any organisation that promotes human rights, just like trolling YouTube videos are not promoting human rights.

I didn't care about compassion for this single idiot, I already said my point was asking about Singapore respect for human rights, not about compassion for this guy exactly.

The perfect society respecting human rights would feel sympathy for this guy, as well as laws would help him instead of punishing him (supposing he's alive, I'm aware he's not).

Society and laws are just two faces of the same system. United States is also extremely cruel against criminals, the laws and the society.

In places like Sweden, laws are not so cruel but society isn't exactly as nice as laws (yet not as cruel as USA). There's a weak balance there.

Saying both things (society/laws) are not related is just absurd. A few minutes after reading this post, I found another post about a kid that was tortured by his mother, and all comments were ""oh poor kid he needs help he will have traumas"". Ironic. When he's a child, he needs help, when he commits a small theft, he is someone who deserves jokes and insults.

I'm not saying you should care about this. I was just asking what do you think about that.

About the fallacies I didn't give a fuck, I just came provoking to read some reactions, I'm aware it was not as coherent as it should.

According to human rights he's a citizen with the same rights as you btw, in case you wonder. I'm tired of reading ""he deserves it"" argument, it's not an argument at all, that's exactly the opposite of human rights.",t3_bhw3f8,29-04-2019

Who here said ""I support the usage of the death penalty as a form of state-sanctioned murder?""

> A demanding customer in Singapore has been fined S$3,000 after turning violent and literally flipping a table at a durian stall, causing damage to unsold durians, two mobile phones, and injury to the stall vendor.

> Reaction to ""rude"" assistant

> According to Lianhe Wanbao, 48-year-old Wei Baode visited a durian stall in Yishun to buy durians for his father at around 4pm on Jul. 6, 2020.

> He approached the 25-year-old female stall vendor to request for bitter durians.

> She replied that her durians generally range from sweet to bitter and was unable to guarantee that the selected durians will be bitter.

> Wei then requested for a pre-purchase taste test, which was refused by the vendor who explained that no taste testing is allowed during the pandemic.

> However, she suggested that he purchase the durian and taste it on the spot.

> Wei agreed and bought a durian to taste it.

> Satisfied with the taste of the durian, he asked the vendor to pick another durian with a similar taste as the one he had bought.

> The vendor repeated that she was unable to guarantee the durian's taste.

> Hence, the customer went ahead and bought a second durian.

> While the vendor was placing the durian into a box, Wei handed some money to a female assistant to pay for the durians.

> She had placed the S$10 worth of change onto the table but Wei did not notice it.

> He subsequently asked the assistant for his change and she pointed at the table in response, which upset him.

> Displeased with her attitude, he believed that she had just flung the change onto the table unceremoniously.

> The assistant denied doing so, which further enraged Wei to the extent that he overturned a table and knocked over numerous boxes of durians.

> The durians that had fallen to the ground could no longer be sold.

> In addition, the vendor and assistant's mobile phone screens shattered upon falling to the ground, setting them back S$140.

> According to the case review, the overturned table had knocked against the vendor's left elbow, and Wei left after flipping the table.

> A fellow female street vendor and the Wei's friend who witnessed the scene immediately hurried forward to mediate between them.

> After stopping him from doing more damage, Wei's friend suggested that he resolve the issue peacefully.

> Wei subsequently had intentions to compensate the vendor.

> Charges against him

> According to Wanbao, Wei faced three charges against him, including reckless behaviour causing bodily injury to others, mischief, and breaching the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA).

> He admitted to two charges and was sentenced to a fine of S$3,000 on Feb. 2.

> In the second of an occasional series of interviews with new MPs who entered Parliament after the 2020 General Election, the PAP's Carrie Tan speaks about her journey from founding an NGO that helps lower-income women to entering mainstream politics.

> SINGAPORE: Nee Soon GRC Member of Parliament Carrie Tan was surprised to be invited in 2018 for tea sessions with the People’s Action Party (PAP) - a precursor to becoming a candidate for the party.

> The founder of Daughters of Tomorrow (DOT), a non-governmental organisation that helps lower-income women, felt that she had been quite critical of the Government. But she thought this would be a good opportunity to speak out for the underprivileged to the ruling party.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> “I feel like I need to help them understand certain things that I'm seeing, and certain issues that they may not have had the opportunity to deep dive into,” she said. “Every single tea session for me was an advocacy moment.”

> Along the way, she met different ministers and MPs, and became convinced of “their conviction and their intention to really do good by Singaporeans”, she said.

> Nee Soon GRC MP Carrie Tan speaks to a Yishun resident. (Photo: Marcus Mark Ramos)

> One deciding factor was that when she spoke her mind, she felt that people listened.

> 

> “I think one of the key considerations I had was ... Do I have to be not myself? Do I have to kind of fit into a certain box in order to get onto this process? I was a bit sceptical,” she said.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> “But it was very encouraging, because every step of the way, I was very honest. I shared my views, and people listened, and they were receptive to what I had to share … (and) I guess in the end, I felt like: Can lah!”

> She said that in her years of trying to solve the issue of poverty, she had seen that the challenges low-income families face are “multi-faceted”.

> “Being in politics gives me a wider platform to take a more holistic approach to looking at some of the things that society needs to probably shift or change in order to provide better scaffolding and stepping stones for the poor among us,” she said.

> “WE ARE A MISUNDERSTOOD PLACE”

> Advertisement

> Seven months on from the 2020 General Election, the Nee Soon South representative seemed quite at home at a Yishun Ring Road coffee shop having crispy prata and a barley drink.

> Sitting along a busy thoroughfare flanked by two coffee shops, the interview was interrupted a few times by residents saying “hi” to their MP.

> 

> When Yishun’s reputation as a magnet for cat killers, murders, petty crime and bad news in general is brought up, she bristled: “I love Yishun, I love the people here. We are a misunderstood place, okay.

> “We have the most charming, loveliest people. So many do-gooders,” she effused, gesturing at the people having their dinner or drinks.

> “You see the coffee shop uncles. They will like from here shout across to there. It's very kampong, I love it.”

> MP Carrie Tan chatting with residents in her ward. (Photo: Marcus Mark Ramos)

> She admits that there are residents who compare her to former MP Lee Bee Wah, who was MP there for 14 years, and was affectionately known as “Hua Jie” or “Sister Flower” among Yishun residents.

> “I think there's only natural and normal. There are different kinds of residents, some of them will compare and say: Hey, you know, last time Dr Lee used to do this this this, that that that ... I can learn from that,” she said.

> “Then there'll be other residents who say: Don't worry, just be yourself. We support you, just to do what you do.”

> A NEW SOCIAL ENTERPRISE

> The little changes that Ms Tan has started to make can be seen in a banner with bright pink lettering advertising her weekly Meet-the-People sessions. It reads “Bringing care to you on …” followed by the day, time and location of the MPS, and the hashtag #Carriecares.

> At her division, Nee Soon South, she has changed the language of the reminder notices for residents that fall into arrears for conservancy charges.

> “We've adopted a much more supportive stance to say that if you're meeting any kind of financial hardship that's causing you to not be able to pay your bills, please reach out to us ... Don’t bear this alone,” she said.

> Ms Tan, who has stepped down as the head of DOT, also plans to pilot a new social enterprise, called RISE Community, at Yishun. While she’s known as an advocate for women’s issues and gender equality, she now wants to reach out to men.

> “I spent five, six years of my life building up an engine to enable the women. This is like the next step where I'm looking to do more work to enable men,” she said.

> The details are under wraps, but she said the NGO will reach out to men who have lost their jobs or are in danger of losing them, to help them develop better coping mechanisms and create a supportive community for them.

> There are many initiatives for people to gain new skills and match them to jobs, but she thinks that the ability to embrace such opportunities requires a mindset change. “I think we underestimate the extent of mental emotional toil that poverty has on people. We expect them to just pick their feet and then ... find a job the next day.”

> MP Carrie Tan meets residents in her ward. (Photo: Marcus Mark Ramos)

> More would be shared later this month when the initiative is launched, she said.

> When asked about her thoughts on the 2021 Budget that was delivered on Feb 16, she expressed concern about the fast pace at which Singapore’s economy is transforming.

> “Although it is necessary, I do find that we should consider putting more resources into helping those who are further behind at the lowest or lower income groups, who may find it harder to catch up,” she said.

> “I think that the cost of not mitigating the crisis that the lowest income groups are facing, that may come to bite us in the future, because then it will create consequences in terms of their mental, emotional and physical health.”

> ACTIVIST OR MP?

> With her salt-and-pepper hair, activist background and tattoos, Ms Tan is not in the usual mould of a PAP MP.

> When asked about her tattoos (there are three), she shared that the kite tattooed on her wrist symbolises “letting go”, and was inked in 2013, when she pivoted her social enterprise to a charity.

> “That was the best decision I made - to really scale up the work. Kite - you have to let go to fly further,” she said.

> Does she still see herself as activist or is she more of an MP these days?

> “These are just job titles,” she said as she listed her various roles these days as grassroots adviser, parliamentarian, Nee Soon town council vice-chair and continued involvement in her social enterprises.

> “At the end of the day, I'm serving the people, and I'm passionate about moving certain causes.”

> In the course of the conversation, she reflects that her views have evolved in the process of being initiated into politics and after talking to more people from different age groups, and with various cultural backgrounds and beliefs.

> “Being an activist, I can also sometimes have certain rather idealistic views about certain topics,” she said.

> “I definitely grew in my understanding and perspective of the diversity of opinions people have about different issues … having understanding and mutual respect in society is very important, and I think I have faith that in Singapore, we are a society where we can agree to disagree on things.”

The other meaning is mocking others for having similar mindset like the baby boomers generation or being out of touch in a young age. So mocking others regardless of age.

> The incident happened at 4.30am, at 37 Miltonia Close.

> ""I'm Singaporean, don't need to talk about mask""

> In the video uploaded onto Angel Supermart's Facebook Page, the man can be seen getting increasingly agitated, shouting, ""You wasting my time ah, you wasting my time. Don't talk about mask, I'm Singaporean, don't need to talk about mask. What mask?""

> Followed by, ""Wa your mother..."", and ""Both also same price, both also same price. You want to waste my time for what?""

> He ended up storming off after his exchange got denied, but not before raining insults and expletives on the employee.

> Boss of store: ""We face this shit everyday""

> According to Daniel, the boss of the supermart, the dispute was due to an alcohol exchange dispute.

> ""It’s a Foodpanda order, we cannot exchange to something else even it’s similar price, customer go back and later a refund request comes in saying “merchant give wrong”, a lot of incidents like this""

> The boss later clarified with Stomp that it was not over a delivery order, but just a customer exchanging to a different alcohol brand.

> In other points brought out in the supermart's Facebook post, he questioned what nationality had to do with mask wearing.

> ""Pls wear a mask, telling our staff “don’t tell me about mask, I am a Singaporean” doesn’t make my staff immune, he can feel your spittle on his face, he is terrified and that’s why he turn his body away and called the police.""

> In another comment on the Facebook post, Daniel explained how the staff was apparently terrified as he could feel the spittle landing on him, as the man kept pressing in closer.

> He ended off the post saying these incidents are exceedingly common.

> ""Using vulgarities on a service staff is precisely the reason why nobody wants to do retail line. We face this shit everyday""

> According to Stomp, a police report has been lodged and investigations are ongoing.

Schadenfreude (; German: [ˈʃaːdn̩ˌfʁɔʏ̯də] (listen); lit. 'harm-joy') is the experience of pleasure, joy, or self-satisfaction that comes from learning of or witnessing the troubles, failures, or humiliation of another. Schadenfreude is a complex emotion where, rather than feeling sympathy, one takes pleasure from watching someone's misfortune. This emotion is displayed more in children than adults.

I beg to differ. For such a small country we have a pretty incredible amount of huge three lane roads going right down the middle of residential towns. 

Go to any other high density city and you’ll see that the roads are often super narrow and parking costs way more exorbitant than lots in our CBD.

On the other hand, sidewalks, especially in mature estates are often so narrow you can barely have 2 people passing each other in opposite directions. Plus we often have a grass patch separating the sidewalk and road, which takes up yet more space.",t3_klg819,28-12-2020

Cycling on sidewalks or shared paths just doesn’t work. Blind spots, turns, narrow width, bus stops, all sorts of obstacles. 

Then again, the people making these decisions’ idea of cycling is probably just toys for fun at ECP or lim chu Kang road on weekends. They don’t see it as an actual viable alternative to public transport and private cars.",t3_klg819,28-12-2020

I don’t think motor vehicles should be entitled to the roar solely by virtue of using it as transportation. People in cars could be on their way to the mall, beach, or whatever to relax as well.

2143,27,ghd8pgc,t1_ghcxzti,"With all due respect, cars have COE to control their numbers on the road therefore we won't have massive traffic jams like in other countries. Do we have control on number of cyclists on road?

I don’t think you see a lot of road cycling happening on weekdays. That’s when most people need to go to work. Even then, the relatively bigger amount of leisure cyclists on weekends are not so much to the point they overpower all the vehicles.

>can our roads handle another 50,000 or even 100,000

Where are you getting these random numbers? Like I said, it’s an infrastructure issue. If cycling volumes exploded to that amount, I’d expect that the government provide adequate cycling lanes so that it’s safe for both motor vehicles and cyclists. As it is currently, you don’t see cyclists swarming everywhere in Singapore to the point that they’re becoming a real obstacle to travel, just something you have to deal with for a few minutes and you’ll be on your merry way. 

Again, motor vehicles are not the only ones that the roads are for; you are not entitled to the roads just because you pay COE and road tax. Our roads can definitely handle them, as most vehicles are driven with only  1-2 people in them and 4 cyclists take up far less space than 2-4 cars. For such a small country and supposedly one that discourages car use, we have wide arterial 3 lane roads that go right down the middle of HDB towns.

Speed doesn’t really make much of a difference to be honest, as I’m sure you’d experience, after I overtake the cyclists, they again appear at my left mirror at the next traffic light and I have to try to overtake again, which I agree can be mildly annoying. 

About age restriction. I agree there needs to be better regulation overall. At least put some compulsory road education for all in schools, or make cyclists go for a test to be road worthy, which I’ll happily take. As well as better enforcement of errant ones blatantly breaking road rules.",t3_klg819,29-12-2020

2. I don't see how people should do sports on the roads. If I am a pro sprinter and run faster than you cycle, can I run on the road? Why do sports on a road where there are traffic lights to stop you every 300m? Please explain.",t3_klg819,29-12-2020
2146,27,ghdbguk,t1_ghda906,"Like I said, stop making this about cyclists vs drivers. It is an **infrastructure** issue.

Cyclists go on roads because there’s nowhere else to go. The reason they cycle, be it leisure or transport, is irrelevant here. Just like the reason you drive on the road doesn’t matter. 

Some people also drive/motorbike for leisure on the roads because they are vehicle enthusiasts. And there’s nothing wrong with that. 

Look, have you tried cycling on our park connector network and sidewalks before? It’s often impractical, as the routes are often right beside very busy pedestrian networks, going right though bus stops, constantly having to stop at HDB car park entrances. They are narrow, slippery, often littered with obstacles and just very inconvenient and impractical. 

You know those wider shared tracks with the yellow colored PCN painted big big in the middle? They tend to abruptly stop and then back to squeezing with pedestrians. The national route network right now is rather spotty.

I personally don’t cycle on roads most of the time as I’m lucky enough to have good PCN along my route, but not everyone is like that. If you don’t live near a good one, or your route encompasses multiple sections of road then PCN then road then PCN, it’s just easier and way more feasible to use the road entirely. 

And if you are a pro marathon runner, you cannot run faster than I cycle. Don’t be ridiculous. I went to check, and the world record speed was 21km/h, which I can easily cycle faster than no problem. 

I personally prefer to do my leisure cycling at East coast due to the lack of lights, but if others prefer to do round island or whatever that’s not my place to judge.

Look, I get it that you’re frustrated with cyclists on the roads. I really really do. I’m a driver as well like I said and some of them who ignore the rules really boggle my mind and make me think of them as pests sometimes. It can be really hella annoying.

But have some empathy for the other side. The solution to this is to have dedicated cycling lanes that everyone can be safe and happy, like the one at Tanah Merah coast road. Works pretty well, no friction and cyclists are free to go at their own leisurely pace while not impeding traffic. 

No, dedicated cycle lanes will not decrease the amount of lanes you have for your road, don’t worry. Cycling lanes are often just 1/3-1/2 the width of a normal car lane, and we can easily add one to the side of roads or incorporate them into existing bus lanes.",t3_klg819,29-12-2020

2150,27,ghdeql9,t1_ghde4ay,"Certain PCNs are very good, yeah, like Ulu Pandan or East coast or changi areas. But Those areas are often going through unpopulated or green areas.

I’m talking about park connectors like [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/xSRoC9rr5XfY1PLT8) that run through neighborhoods, and can vary in quality. As you can see, it’s right beside HDB and where pedestrians will walk to a bus stop. Some pedestrians just Looove to walk on the cycling path, mind you. 

I’m in western Singapore too and the ones in Jurong area can be hit or miss, but the Punggol and sengkang newer ones are very good.

Still, these paths are often winding and unnecessarily slopey that it can be frustrating. 

Yes, as of now infrastructure exists but it’s not very useful for commuting. For longer distance sport cycling, the PCN is still nowhere near as extensive as the road network. 

For example I can cycle the entire stretch to Marina bay to changi just fine, but https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/park-connector-network indicates that the only way to get from Punggol to woodlands and yishun and from woodlands to Choa chu Kang is via sidewalk or road.",t3_klg819,29-12-2020

> Photos appeared to show the cat lying near a wall, with its legs twisted out from underneath it at an odd angle. Blood smears could also be seen on the floor next to the cat. 

> Specks of blood could also be seen on a staircase apparently leading down to the scene.

> Channel NewsAsia understands the cat was found near a staircase on the second floor of the block, and that blood could also be seen on the void deck.

> The Cat Welfare Society told Channel NewsAsia that it was informed of the possible cat abuse case by a volunteer. 

> The cat was found dead at a stairway early on Wednesday morning, said Ms Laura Ann Meranda, the Cat Welfare Society&apos;s executive director. 

> ""The body position of the cat and the injuries inflicted (lean) towards possible abuse,"" she said, adding that the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) has started investigations into the incident.

> ""AVA has started their investigations and will be establishing if the dead cat is indeed a roaming pet cat,"" she said.

> ""We advise all cat owners to keep their pet cats strictly indoors as this is the only measure to prevent any potential abuse in stairways or in areas where there is not much human traffic,"" she added.

I'm not sure how you reached that conclusion. There were 50(!) police reports made over Rodrigues approaching them. The Tays were also pushed to the edge multiple times already.

There is also a formal set of procedures to follow after the examination. If the psychiatrist determines that he is not of unsound mind and knows what he is doing, he will be charged for an appropriate offence such as trespass, mischief, public nuisance. 

This case caught many by surprise as I understand that the Police was called over 50 times. 

As he was serving NS, he clearly is not of unsound mind but has something related to OCD. But then again he punched an elderly lady.

As for your second point, the therapists have mentioned that Rodrigues showed behaviour consistent with the autism spectrum and OCD, so simply “stopping” is not a behaviour we can reasonably expect of people with such conditions.

> SINGAPORE - Hailstones reportedly fell in some areas in Singapore including Yishun and Seletar during a bout of heavy rain on Tuesday evening (Jan 30).

> A reader who gave her name as Madam Lee M.L. told The Straits Times that she was in her Yishun home at about 4.45pm when she noticed a clattering sound amid the rain.

> ""The rain came quite suddenly, there was very loud thunder and lightning as well,"" said the 47-year-old, who lives on the fourth floor of a condominium.

> ""When I looked out of my balcony, I saw some white cubes hitting on the glass door of the balcony. I thought it looked like ice cubes.""

> Madam Lee said there were about five hailstones that were the size of five cent and 10 cent coins.

> Videos she sent in to ST show small pieces of what appear to be hailstones raining down onto the balcony floor of her home.

> ""It&apos;s so amazing to see this at my balcony,"" she said. ""I&apos;ve seen snow before but not hail.""

> A video posted on Facebook by Mygolf Sg purportedly shows ""hailstones at Seletar Golf Club"".

> Hail is rare in Singapore but not unheard of.

> In 2014, hailstones were reportedly seen in Turf Club Road during a heavy downpour. In 2013, a rare hailstorm uprooted trees and disrupted traffic.

> The last reported incidence of hail before this was in 2008.

> According to the National Environment Agency&apos;s (NEA&apos;s) website, hail is produced only by cumulonimbus or thunderstorm clouds.

> The stones consist mostly of ice, measuring between 5mm and 50mm in diameter, with larger stones occurring in severe thunderstorms.

> Hail forms in strong thunderstorm clouds with intense updrafts and where a good portion of the cloud layer is below 0 deg C.

> Hail is less common in the tropics despite a higher frequency of thunderstorms because the atmosphere over the tropics tends to be warmer over a much greater depth.

> It is more frequently seen along mountain ranges, as mountains force horizontal winds upwards, intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely.

> ST has contacted NEA for more information.

> SINGAPORE — Six youths hatched a plot to get quick money, with one of them climbing into stalls in a hawker centre about midnight and stealing cash while the others kept a lookout.

> They stole about S$1,000 from a curry puff stall at Yishun Park Hawker Centre, but among the lookouts, only Ng Qiang Qing waited for his friend to finish the deed. They then distributed the stolen money among themselves, getting about S$150 each.

> On Friday (June 14), Ng, who turned 17 on Thursday, was sentenced to two years’ probation for his actions. He pleaded guilty to one count each of theft in dwelling, rioting, and abetting the impersonation of a public servant.

> He was also ordered to perform 180 hours of community service and spend a year at Singapore Boys' Hostel, a juvenile probation institution. His father posted a bond of S$5,000 to ensure his good behaviour.

> Besides the three charges he admitted to, five other charges of theft were taken into consideration for sentencing.

> The court heard that the hawker theft occurred on July 17, 2018, when Ng met up with his five other youths, aged between 15 and 17 years old, at the hawker centre at about midnight.

> One of them used a chair to climb over a wall and get into Mr Zaidi Zainal’s curry puff stall. There, he used the key that Mr Zaidi had left inserted in the keyhole of the cash register box to open it, and took S$1,064 in cash.

> When he climbed out of the stall, only Ng was still waiting. The other four youths had left.

> Court documents showed that they also stole cash, ranging from S$10 to S$200, from three other stalls

> Mr Zaidi called the police later that day, saying that he realised all the money in his cash box — where he kept his daily earnings — was missing when he opened the stall at 9am.

> In a separate incident, the court heard that late on the night of April 30 this year, Ng got into a group fight at Yishun Avenue 11.

> It started when his friend began arguing with another group of youths playing football at the void deck of a block of flats, after someone in the group commented on his walking gait.

> Later, feeling unhappy, Ng’s friend decided to return to confront the group. Ng joined him and three other youths, and began fighting with the other group, punching and kicking each other.

> Ng was involved in another offence just a few hours later at about 6.15am on May 1, this year.

> He was walking along Sentosa Boardwalk with three other friends when he saw two Bangladeshi foreign construction workers sleeping on a bench. Ng then suggested to his friends that they approach them.

> When the workers woke up, one of Ng’s friends, Muhammad Isnalli David told them they were not allowed to sleep there.

> The 16-year-old then took out his identity card, claimed to be a police officer from the Criminal Investigation Department, and demanded they show him their work permits and give him their wallets.

> One of the workers took out his wallet to get his permit. Isnalli then snatched the wallet and took S$379 from it.

> When the other worker refused to hand over his wallet, Ng and Muhammad Salman Mohd Mehmood, 16, pretended to make phone calls to request for backup to lend credibility to Isnalli’s claim to be a CID officer.

> Ng’s actions, in pretending to make the back-up call, amounted to abetting the impersonation of a public servant — in this case, a police officer.

> Later, someone called the police on behalf of the workers, saying the youths had taken their money and ran off in the direction of Resorts World Sentosa. He added that Isnalli was not wearing a shirt.

Tomatoes, fruits left on the kitchen counter were pecked. The contents of the small bin was tossed. They're smart enough to attempt to overturn covers that are light enough for them to look for food.

I cannot describe to you how it feels until you've had to deal with it yourself, but I will try. For most people, your house is supposed to be your 'safe space' where you can do what you want. But these birds visiting and spoiling your food force you to react. You end up having to cover your food, close the windows (and stifle air flow), etc. I've ever tried closing the windows, leaving a gap with a width of ~4 fingers for air flow. They actually got in through that gap. It feels like an invasion that you have to spend either money (wire mesh) or effort to stop. This is not what we hope our homes will be like, where we have to keep an eye on our stuff. Home is supposed to be safe.

> Rescue officers from an animal welfare group took action after receiving a call to their hotline about a myna seen dangling outside the flat in Yishun.

> ""Our rescue officers were shocked to learn from the unit’s resident that the myna was deliberately hung from the pole to teach the myna (and other mynas) a lesson so they can 'learn' not to enter her kitchen,"" said the Animal Concerns Research & Education Society (ACRES) in a Facebook post on Wednesday (Dec 11).

> ""The myna was assessed for injuries and given some water and food before being released.""

> The woman was told that this was an act of cruelty, and given advice on other ways to deter birds from her home, said the group.

> The National Parks Board (NParks) is currently investigating the case, it added.

> SINGAPORE: The National Environment Agency (NEA) will release more Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes at three sites between April this year and January 2019. 

> They are Tampines Street 81, Tampines Avenue 4 and Nee Soon East.

> This will mark the second phase of studying the use of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to suppress the Aedes aegypti mosquito population in Singapore, the agency said. 

> Depending on the need, it said more mosquitoes may end up being released compared to the first phase of the study, which began in October 2016.

> During the [first phase of the study](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nea-to-release-bacteria-carrying-mosquitoes-in-former-clusters-t-7893040), NEA released thousands of Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes over a period of six months in Tampines West, Nee Soon East and Braddell Heights.

> NEA said it would be making improvements to its strategies and tactics for release in the second phase, based on the results from Phase 1, which it said yielded “valuable ecological information”.

> MOSQUITOES RELEASED FROM HIGHER GROUND

> The first phase of the study showed that there was 50 per cent reduction of the urban Aedes Aegypti mosquito population at the study sites compared to areas where no infected mosquitoes were released, NEA said.

> Both had a similar Aedes mosquito population prior to the release.

> The mosquito population in the study sites fell because the eggs that are produced when the Wolbachia-infected male mates with uninfected urban Aedes females do not hatch, NEA said.

> But the agency added that the first phase of the study also threw up some challenges.

> For example, Singapore’s densely-packed housing environment saw mosquitoes easily ""migrating"" from surrounding areas into the release sites where the population had fallen.

> In fact, data showed that about 20 per cent of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes were found outside release sites, suggesting that a similar number of urban Aedes mosquitoes would move into the release sites.

> NEA also found that there were mosquito breeding incidents at higher floors of apartment blocks, while the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes released at these sites only flew up to the eighth floor on average.

> Hence, there were not enough infected mosquitoes to suppress the mosquito population on these higher floors.

> NEA said the second phase of the study would involve releasing infected mosquitoes from ground floors as well as high floors of apartment blocks.

> Going forward, it will also limit the release to Tampines West and Nee Soon East, as the Braddell Heights area is mostly made up of landed property.

> To address the movement of mosquitoes, it will extend the release to bigger areas within Tampines West and Nee Soon. 

> RELEASED MOSQUITOES WILL BE X-RAYED TO MITIGATE IMPACT OF INFECTED FEMALE MOSQUITOES IN ENVIRONMENT

> NEA said its current methods of separating the mosquitoes to release only male mosquitoes can also be improved.

> Typically, male pupae are smaller than females, and physically separating infected male mosquitoes from female ones is laborious.

> NEA said its current methodology for large scale sex-sorting results in about 0.3 per cent of infected female mosquitoes being released.

> The agency’s Director-General of Public Health, Derek Ho, said while the presence of infected females will not have much of an impact in the short-run, it could limit NEA’s overall approach of using Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to suppress the population.

> “The Wolbachia itself will have some blocking of the dengue transmission so there is no danger of dengue transmission but in the long-term, we do not want the population of female Wolbachia mosquitoes out there because it just means that in the future, we will not be able to continue to use the release of male Wolbachia mosquitoes to suppress the population,” Mr Ho said.

> That’s because the males will eventually be able to mate with the infected female mosquitoes and produce eggs that hatch into offspring, while NEA&apos;s strategy is to reduce the population of mosquitoes altogether. 

> Going forward, he said mosquitoes released as part of the study will undergo a low-dose X-ray treatment to sterilise any female mosquitoes that are not eliminated through the sex-sorting process.

> “This very low dosage of X-ray that we are using will sterilise the females but will not affect the virility of the males so that even if this very small number of females are released, they will not be able to produce any progeny,” Mr Ho said.

> He added that the sex-sorting is done at the pupae stage, after which the x-ray treatment would be applied.

> Emeritus Professor at Duke-NUS’ Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme, Duane Gubler said the method is tried and tested with positive results. Prof Gubler is also Chair of NEA’s Dengue Expert Advisory Panel.

> “Irradiation has been used for years to successfully sterilise insects for use in sterile male release control trials,” he said.

> “We anticipate that this method will increase the efficacy of the Wolbachia sterilised male approach to mosquito control.”

> MORE MOSQUITOES RELEASED WITH GREATER FREQUENCY

> NEA said it may release a larger population of infected mosquitoes compared to the first phase of study. This is due to a general increase in the mosquito population in 2016.

> The potential increase will also address the movement of both infected and urban mosquitoes in and out of the field sites.

> As an example, about one to six male mosquitoes per person could be released each week, as opposed to one in three mosquitoes per person in the first phase of study.

> NEA found that the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes also survived an average of four days in the field. Therefore, to sustain their population, it said it would need to release the required number more frequently.

> The agency said it will now release the mosquitoes twice a week compared to once weekly during the first phase. It would also release mosquitoes at an earlier stage of their life cycle to give them more time to survive at the study sites.

> Results from phase two of the study would “strengthen” NEA’s planning for a larger suppression trial, which was delayed due to the challenges that surfaced in the initial phase.

> NEA said researchers will set up mosquito traps and pupal containers at various locations within the study sites, and urged members of the public not to remove or tamper with these traps.

> It said it would provide residents with more information to residents at the study sites before April.

> SINGAPORE: Tower Transit Singapore has been awarded contracts for the Bulim and Sembawang-Yishun bus packages for a five-year period, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said in a news release on Wednesday (Sep 30).

> The contracts are worth about S$1.03 billion, said LTA, adding that they will progressively start from the second quarter of 2021.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The Sembawang-Yishun package, currently operated by SMRT Buses, consists of 27 bus services. They will operate from the new Mandai Depot, which will be handed over to Tower Transit by October.

> Tower Transit will also manage Sembawang and Yishun bus interchanges.

> 

> The Bulim package, which consists of 29 bus services, is already being operated by Tower Transit. It will continue to manage Bukit Batok and Jurong East bus interchanges.

> TRANSITION OF AFFECTED WORKERS

> LTA said SMRT employees affected by the changes must be offered jobs by the incoming operator, adding that their employment terms should not be worse than the terms they were under before the transition.

> ""Affected SMRT employees of the Sembawang-Yishun bus package will be protected by the Guidelines on Good Employment Practices in the Public Bus Industry,"" LTA said.

> ""All employees affected by new tender or change in bus service contracts must be offered a job by the incoming operator.""

> In a Facebook post, Executive Secretary of the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU) Melvin Yong said the union will work closely with SMRT and Tower Transit to ensure a ""smooth transition"" for affected workers.

> ""The union is committed to working with the different public transport operators to take care of our bus workers and create a safe working environment for them,"" Mr Yong said.

> The tender for the Bulim and Sembawang-Yishun bus packages was called in November last year, and bus operators had the option to bid for either bus package or for both.

> 

> Tower Transit was awarded the contract for the combined package, because it received the highest total score taking into account both price and quality factors in its proposal, said LTA.

> 

> ""If TTS (Tower Transit Singapore) performs well during the five-year term, LTA has the option to extend the contract term by another two years at the end of the five-year contract,"" added the authority.

> The harassment resulted in 59 police reports lodged by Tay’s family and culminated in Rodrigues being referred to the Centre for Psychotherapy for counselling sessions by the community court.

> Rodrigues was later referred to the Institute of Mental Health, where a psychiatrist found symptoms suggestive of Asperger’s syndrome and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. However, the counselling sessions and a protection order taken out by Tay’s family did nothing to stop Rodrigues.

> Unable to deal with the harassment, the family reacted in violence on several occasions. For example, after Rodrigues knocked on the family’s door non-stop for a minute in early 2016, Lim sprayed insecticide on Rodrigues’ face.

> Things came to a head on 9 July 2016 after Rodrigues harassed the family at their Yishun flat five times that day starting from 8.45am, when Rodrigues banged on the door and shouted for Tay.

> At 7.40pm, Rodrigues again called for Tay. But he fled when Lim opened the gate. Tay gave chase, resulting in a scuffle between himself and Rodrigues near the lift lobby and staircase landing. Both men fell down the staircase with Rodrigues landing on top of Tay.

> Tay then rolled Rodrigues over, locked him in a prone position and punched his head at least three times. He also stomped on his shoulder twice and placed his knee on Rodrigues’ back to prevent him from getting up. Lim helped Tay by grabbing and locking Rodrigues’ feet. 

> Tay also turned Rodrigues’ face to the side when he saw him bleeding from the nose so that the victim would not drown in his own blood.

> Neighbours later helped Tay and Lim to bind Rodrigues at the ankles and hands and call for the police.

> Tay and Lim then went back to their unit. They only learnt that Rodrigues had died when a policeman visited their flat. Tay was then arrested.

> At their trial, Tay and Lim said their sole intention was to detain Rodrigues and hand him over to the police.

> But District Judge Tan said the evidence clearly showed that the victim’s life was endangered by their use of excessive force.

> The maximum punishment for causing grievous hurt is up to 10 years’ jail along with a fine and caning. Only male offenders below 50 can be caned.

> Sometimes, brands have problems communicating what their whole deal is about.

> This particular one doesn’t.

> Advertisement

> Here is the logo for Mrs Carwash, which according to the co-founder, is Singapore’s very first all-female car wash.

> And that is a deliberate choice.

> “Fun and unique washing experience”

> Royce, one of the co-owners of the establishment told Mothership that he had “never experienced” an all-female car wash before.

> He stated that the reason for using female washers is to “create a fun and unique washing experience which we cannot achieve the same results with males (sic)”.

> Advertisement

> That curiosity, mixed with the inevitable “first-mover” advantage, spurred him to set up such a company.

> Opening on August 9 with a promotion

> It will open on August 9, 2019, with a promotion to boot.

> For those curious about what exactly the sizes represent, here they are.

> – Small cars are hatchback cars

> – Medium cars are sedans/SUVs

> – Large cars are luxury sedans

> – They also have an option for vans and MPVs

> They are also using Chemical Guys, a well-known American automotive detailing product.

> Advertisement

> Sexism

> And while one might think it’s a pop-up stall type of scenario, disappearing behind a wall of foam after the last fireworks go off, Royce has big plans for the venture.

> Invariably, issues of sexism might rise, with some questioning whether the women will be used as sexualised props instead of being seen as actual employees.

> This is a claim spurred on by the negative associations with the previous bikini carwash in Singapore.

> Royce, however, was quite adamant that this is a whole different ball game.

> When we broached the subject of the possibility of girls in bikinis, Royce quickly shut down the idea that his staff would be in swimwear.

> “Mrscarwash is a legitimate and a non shady female carwash business. Hence, our girls will be wearing personalised crop tops with shorts and flip flops.”

> Advertisement

> Perhaps something like this.

> “I do not intend to exploit any females to dress in a revealing or skimpily manner and it’s going to be just another job for them,” he added.

> He also reiterated that it will be “just another car wash business”.

> “Frankly speaking, I choose to believe that concerns of sexism may float up from the general public but i strongly believe that with proper honest working ethics, even if it involves fully female washers, it’ll be just another car wash business where customers get their car cleaned up.”

> The car wash will open their doors on August 9, 2019.

> Location: 15 Yishun Industrial Street 1 #01-09

> Opening hours: 2pm to 2am

They had to cover the triple murder case.

One of my cohort working in that station complained to me, while we were training in an NSMen orientation session afterwards, that the ambulance was so full of blood that they had to go offline for three hours to clean up the mess.

Salute to that ambulance that brought one of the girls in time to survival and later on become the only witness to stand in court and finally sentenced the man to death.

But regarding Yishun, I've seen suicide (I seen the man in the morning and in the evening, the latter time with some of his brain matter visible on the ground), a couple of assault cases, someone drowning or hanging in apparent suicide near the large water park after Khatib station towards the city, and even a case of a mentally-ill patient having the hots for one of our ambulance drivers.

I grew up playing in Yishun as a Scout (my school was part of the Northern Cluster alongside Ahmad Ibrahim and Yishun Town Secondary, so we had some extended co-partner events with them at Terror Sea Scout Camp) and was part of a nationwide event (somewhere in 2000) that saw me running across Yishun in an ""Amazing Race""-style competition.

People living in the north of Singapore are sicker at a younger age.

In the north and central areas of Singapore, 20 per cent of public  healthcare patients account for 84 per cent of healthcare expenditure.

But patients in the north are, on average, six years younger.

The mean age among ""top users"" - the top 20 per cent of patients who  account for the highest healthcare usage - is 44.4 years in central  areas but 38.2 years in the north.

This came as an unpleasant surprise to Professor Philip Choo, chief executive of the National Healthcare Group (NHG).

When public healthcare was reconfigured into three clusters two years  ago, the local population under NHG care grew by 50 per cent from one  million to more than 1.5 million people.

That was when Prof Choo discovered that healthcare usage appeared  high in the north even though the general population there was younger.

&#x200B;

📷

Said Prof Choo: ""Central has higher healthcare cost per capita  because there are more older people. But the north has higher  age-specific cost at every age group.""

He had expected that since the population in the north was younger, the cost of healthcare there would be lower.

>HIGHER COSTS ACROSS THE BOARD  
 **Central has higher healthcare cost per capita because there  are more older people. But the north has higher age-specific cost at  every age group.**  
 PROFESSOR PHILIP CHOO, chief executive of the National Healthcare Group, breaking down medical costs across Singapore.  
 

""But the percentage who are frail and who have chronic illness is about the same, but younger,"" he said.

Hospitals usually look at four conditions when defining frailty:

•Aged 65 years and older;

•Multiple chronic diseases;

•Complications that have resulted in a disability;

•Social or financial issues.

When age was removed as a criterion, the NHG found that many people deemed ""frail"" were in only their late 50s and early 60s.

Said Prof Choo: ""When we just look at frailty, the two (central and  north) have the same proportion, although the number of elderly is lower  in the north. So we know there is something wrong.""

The NHG found the mean age for frailty in the central region to be 70.6 years, but 65.9 years in the north.

It was not because there were more poor people in the north.

The main difference was fewer Chinese in the north. About 74 per cent  of Singapore's population is Chinese. In the north, it is 67 per cent  and in the central area, 81 per cent. The Chinese here tend to live  longer and get sick at an older age.

A 2013 article in British-based scientific journal BioMed Central  looking at ethnic differences in life expectancies from 1965 to 2009  reported that the Chinese were significantly ahead of the other ethnic  groups in terms of life expectancy.

The article, by the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said a  Chinese girl born in 2005 can expect to live 12 years longer than a  Malay boy born in the same year.

It also noted that life expectancies for all three ethnic groups had  risen significantly. For example, for Malay men, it had gone up from 64  years in 1965 to 75 years by 2005. But it lagged behind the 80 years  that men of other races enjoyed.

Much of the difference was due to lifestyle, which is modifiable, the  article said. Malays here consume the most fat in their diets,  including higher amounts of saturated fat, and the least fruit and  vegetables.

Fewer Malays in Singapore screen for colorectal, breast and cervical  cancers, which may account for their dying of cancer at a younger age  than the other races. More Malays also smoke, which is a major health  risk.

Dr Matthias Toh, who oversees population health at NHG, said the  group will encourage people, even those below the age of 40, to go for  earlier health screening to catch and deal with health issues early.

The NHG will seek to increase health literacy - such as by getting  people to choose healthier meals, and promoting exercise and obesity  management - so that future generations in the north will be healthier  than the present cohort.",t3_bl78t2,06-05-2019

i thought it’s gonna be some yishun joke again but it turns out to be just another cultural thing.

aiya, just keep spamming the health advice to people bah. People will sooner or later get that they are eating more than they should and either exercise or eat less.

inb4 eating disorder etc.

i’m not advocating “just eat less”. i’m advocating “figure out how much your body consume on a daily basis and go slightly lower or meet that.”

if you go over, you are gonna gain weight unless you work it out somehow.

Stomp understands that the empty bullet cartridge was from a 5.56mm assault rifle.

It was discovered along a road, outside Orchard Park Secondary School, by a passer-by who kicked the object and then alerted the police.

Stomper Kojhi Toh was outside the school at around 9pm when he noticed several police officers at the scene.

The local singer-songwriter told Stomp: ""An area was cordoned off.


""I think there were around 10 police officers.

""They later appeared to collect something from the cordoned-off area.""

In response to a Stomp query, the police said that they responded to a case along Yishun Street 81 at 8.09pm, where an empty bullet cartridge was found at the said location.

> SINGAPORE - Supermarket chain Sheng Siong has apologised after a customer found a number of large maggots wriggling in a carton of quail eggs last Tuesday (April 16).

> The incident comes less than two months after a customer found several maggots in a carton of quail eggs he bought from NTUC FairPrice.

> And in January this year, another customer was given a refund after finding maggots in the live crabs he bought from FairPrice Finest.

> Footage of the most recent incident was uploaded to citizen journalism website Stomp on Monday.

> The customer, who wished to be known only as Amy, told Stomp that she had bought the eggs, which were due to expire last Friday, from a Sheng Siong outlet at Junction Nine mall in Yishun on April 11.

> When she opened the carton to cook the eggs last Tuesday, however, she spotted ""big, fat maggots"" wriggling next to one of the eggs.

> Amy said the incident left her ""shocked and disgusted"", and added that she threw the whole carton away afterwards.

> Related Story Customer finds maggots in quail egg; FairPrice working with supplier to investigate matter

> Related Story Customer finds maggots in live crabs bought from FairPrice, given refund

> On Monday, a Sheng Siong spokesman told The Straits Times that the chain has offered Amy a refund, and was grateful that she brought the incident to its knowledge.

> The spokesman said that Sheng Siong conducted a thorough check on the quail eggs on its shelves immediately after receiving Amy's feedback, and will be working with its egg supplier to look into the incident.

> He added that given the fragile nature of eggs, any cracks in an egg's shell may result in an infestation.

> ""As we value food safety and quality, we encourage customers to reach out to us when they encounter similar incidents,"" he said.

> On its website, the Singapore Food Agency advises consumers to look for eggs with clean shells when making their purchases, and to handle them carefully.

> Consumers are also advised not to buy eggs that have cracked shells as they may be contaminated with bacteria.

> The pedestrian had also allegedly shouted at the cyclist, questioning if the food delivery personnel on a bicycle should be riding on the PCN.

> The person attended to by the police is believed to be the pedestrian.

> There were two personal mobility devices and one bicycle in the photo.

> SINGAPORE: The police are investigating an incident at an indoor playground in Yishun where a man was seen kicking a young boy. 

> CCTV footage of the incident, which happened at Sunshine Childhood Playland at NorthPoint City, was widely circulated online after it was shared on Facebook by the boy&apos;s mother. 

> In response to queries from Channel NewsAsia, the police confirmed on Tuesday (Apr 10) that a report was made and investigations are ongoing.   

> In the video, the boy was seen moving towards the man, who was with a woman and two young children.

> As the boy got closer, he was pushed and kicked by the man. The man then threw a toy shovel he was holding at a nearby slide. 

> The boy then appeared to hit the man&apos;s back, and the man retaliated by pushing the boy towards the slide. 

> At the end of the clip, a woman who appeared to be the boy&apos;s mother was seen walking into the playground just as the boy hit the man&apos;s back again with his fist. The man reacted by standing tall and staring at the boy. 

> The boy&apos;s mother, Ms Ow May Chen, wrote on Facebook: ""We are just so shocked and sad after watching CCTV footage.""

> She added, however, that she shared ""some responsibility"" for what happened as she did not supervise her son, named Dex, for ""90 seconds"". 

> Ms Ow told Channel NewsAsia that she confronted the man when she heard the commotion. 

> ""(I told him that) he didn&apos;t have to treat a five-year-old like that,"" said Ms Ow. 

> The man, who alleged that Dex had pushed his son, responded in Mandarin: ""(Do you) want to wait until your child knocks into my child, then say sorry?"" 

> Dex, who is in kindergarten, suffered injuries to his stomach and groin, said Ms Ow. 

> ""My son is autistic but he is not a threat to other younger kids. He is playful and likes to join other kids in play."" 

> ""We teach him how to behave ‘the social norm’ way in public,"" Ms Ow said, adding that Dex has never hurt anybody. 

> Ms Ow explained that Dex retaliated, as seen in the video, because of the way the man treated him.

> She has since taken down the video, saying it caused ""unnecessary inconvenience"" to the playground owner who shared the footage with her so a police report can be made.

3089,27,gk2m9oj,t3_l21ayd,A van can fit in everything? Try Lalamove. $30 only the last time I moved.,t3_l21ayd,21-01-2021
3090,27,gk4x3gj,t3_l21ayd,"The vehicle isn't so much the problem, make sure you book enough manpower as well. The vehicle rental + manpower to move your stuff is two different things (in gogovan and lalamove). Or if you think you can move items by yourself, then its cool.

Suggest you check gogovan or lalamove or some moving companies for a quote. 

good luck in yishun, you're going to need it.",t3_l21ayd,22-01-2021
