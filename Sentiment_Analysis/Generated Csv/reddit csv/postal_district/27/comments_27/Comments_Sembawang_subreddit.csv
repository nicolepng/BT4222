The locals have probably been very annoyed at the shenanigans of these drivers for long enough that their compassion has worn thin. It has become a binary thing when it comes to viewing people sitting inside a lambo. If you‚Äôre the type of person to be inside a lambo, at any time, then, well, you‚Äôre that type of person. You‚Äôre the same type of person where such extravagance and complacence and superiority and ego-trips and adrenaline-rushs appeal to you. Makes very little difference which specific lambo driver you are, the ones the locals know about who‚Äòs always in the area, or the ones in this accident.

You‚Äôre trying to take the moral high ground because you‚Äôve never been part of the locals or attuned to their side of the story. You‚Äôre an outsider to the people here in this reddit thread. They don‚Äôt want to be told by an outsider to chillax and that their grievances ought to mean nothing.

It‚Äôs easy to be empathetic to the obvious superficial story where 2 drivers got in an accident. But I think the true empathy is being able to delve deeper into human nature, see both sides of the story, acknowledge the animosity and subsequently understand why it‚Äôs there. You could tell there‚Äôs animosity here between locals and lambo drivers because they were downvoting you but you were unable or not truly interested in figuring out why. You assumed you had the moral high ground and was happy to stay there without sullying yourself with human nature.

Also, I believe empathy is higher than a sense of morality. Empathy involves understanding how people feel, and sometimes that‚Äôs murky and dark and uncomfortable. Do I personally think the above is justification to be happy about the accident? Not really. I do see your point and I stand with you on that. However, my empathy calls for understanding the other parties, and I understand how they feel about it, and I accept it. You can empathise and show compassion beyond your personal sense of morality.",t3_gyg8t2,08-06-2020

111,27,ftc1kku,t1_ftbz1em,"Thank you for taking your time to explain it to me. I get it that many people are annoyed with these lambo drivers, I experience it too as well, along with some motorcycles. But I do not wish for them to get into an accident just cause of that.

Your second paragraph states that does it matter if it's a different lambo driver? I don't think you mean to but ur applying that all lambo/drivers are a constant nuisance and will always 'cause noise pollution/fear into pedestrains'. I agree that many drives fast and are louder than usual vehicles, but still, I will not be happy if they get into an accident.

The third paragraph, ur stereotyping all lambo drivers as how you view them to be again. As arrogant ect. Yes they do drive flashy cars and are rich, but can we really say that all of them are like that. You may think so but you can't  stereotype a certain group of people. There are many examples about stereotyping which I'm sure you would know about. Still back to my point, no matter how annoying or annoyed you are, do you truly want to wish harm on someone. Whoever does, you're a terrible person.

Fourth paragraph, like I said I experienced it before living in a hdb which is close to a highway. And I do empathize with the locals and their annoyance. I get it why they're annoyed, the victims here are the locals hearing the constant revving, but the true victims IN THIS ACCIDENT, could be someone's father, someone's family member. If there's someone at your workplace who's a loudmouth and likes to show off their wealth, yes you do hate them and are annoyed, but would you be happy if they got into an accident and could potentially die?

Heck I don't even know anyone who owns a lambo or would even dream of being rich enough. At the end of the day, I just felt that it's not right for the op of this comment thread to be happy about the accident. Those who downvoted me, I just assume that they're all happy about the accident and knowing If the owner had sustained major injuries does not change their view or matter. I rest my case.

114,27,ftdldbm,t1_ftc1kku,"I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre getting my point. You‚Äôre very focused on arguing right and wrong thinking. I‚Äôm not touching that concept at all. I‚Äôm just laying out that sometimes it‚Äôs understandable why people pick the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù emotion. I start from ‚ÄúHow can other people be thinking this way? I wonder what compels them to think this way?‚Äù And I can kind of figure out what and why and understand the why. 

And all that explanation in my previous comment, I‚Äôm not talking about myself, I‚Äôm just putting myself in other people‚Äòs shoes. As mentioned above, ‚ÄúI wonder what compels them to think this way?‚Äù is a starting point. And you missed the point about blurring lines between different lambo drivers. It‚Äôs not always the case that lines are blurred, it‚Äôs when people are fed up and their compassion has worn down. Is it that uncommon in your experience that when someone‚Äôs patience has run out that they tend to snap and be black and white about the situation? Kinda like a ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me you‚Äôre with them!‚Äù sentiment when they‚Äôre just so done by that point. Is it *wrong* to react like that? Sure, immature, impulsive, needing anger management, etc etc. **But** my point is that *it happens*. This is what happens. This is what human nature is like. 

And that‚Äòs why I choose to reply to you in the vein of explaining why people were against you (neutral stance), instead of replying to you like other people have (them vs you). I wanted to talk about feelings. Feelings are not right and wrong. I‚Äôm just asking for understanding. Understanding doesn‚Äôt require you to violate your own personal sense of morality. 

But you still keep taking about right vs wrong. You‚Äôre so eager to have a bogeyman to point at and say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wrong‚Äù for feeling/thinking that way and ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt be feeling/thinking this way‚Äù. I mean, I just feel like if you truly understood people then you would have concluded that there‚Äôs no point fighting the people about this. Like I said understanding people who are thinking the wrong things doesn‚Äôt require you to violate your own personal sense of rightness. You can understand why they‚Äôre feeling malicious and mean and just walk away from it, you know? You don‚Äôt lose any bit of yourself but at the same time you gain a bit of insight into human nature and the diversity of people‚Äòs experiences and what certain feelings are capable of driving people to.",t3_gyg8t2,08-06-2020
115,27,ftchc06,t1_ftbqfxe,"I think you're saying that the frustrations of the community doesn't mean we should be rejoicing about people possibly being maimed or killed, which I understand. People here love seeing criminals' blood spilled, though. Just deserts and all. 

I mean, in an ideal world we'd have restrictions and policing to stop inconsiderate drivers, and proportionate punishment metered out by the law. We'd have community complaints promptly addressed and further action taken to prevent this from recurring. But that didn't happen, so people will settle for seeing the culprits splayed across the roads instead.",t3_gyg8t2,08-06-2020

NSFs have little power and always have to abide by orders from the higher ups.

Many people have stated that in times of crisis, they would leave Singapore instead of defending it. So why force everyone to go through harsh training that disrupts their education/work life? Others wrote that people get punished because a single person does something wrong in their squadron. NS may break people beyond repair. If the Govt is suppressing NS suicide news by only releasing a few, then you can clearly tell that there is something wrong. At least look through the NS laws to consider what‚Äôs just wrong, PAP.

Essentially, depression and mental health issues are poorly-understood, especially considering the impact they have on our lives. So people who have problems don't know how to sound out, or feel that it is unsafe or unwise to do so. (And having depression makes it even harder to speak out anyway, due to its very nature.) A major disruption to a daily routine, such as joining national service (or getting a new job, or moving to a new country, or whatever) is often enough to bring everything out of balance. If the sufferer feels alone and isolated enough that they don't feel they can talk about their problems with anyone else, then suicide might seem like the path of least resistance.

What is important is to recognize that just tissue packets alone does not constitute a final solution, even if it happens to resemble one to bystanders.",t3_9jkpyr,28-09-2018

> This might be the most bizarre wildlife story you've heard in Singapore as of late.

> A family of four was reported to have driven to a private estate in Sembawang to catch the free-range chickens there, Chinese evening paper Shin Min Daily News reported on June 9.

> Family drove to Sembawang to catch free-range chickens

> The residents living at Thong Bee Road told Shin Min that some free-range chickens have appeared in the area in recent years.

> They have been feeding the chickens and lived harmoniously with them.

> However, they realised that some chickens had gone missing since June 5.

> Members of the public saw one young couple, in their 30s, drove to the estate with two young children to catch the chickens.

> Mostly targeted the hens

> A coffee shop employee, 50, told the reporter that he saw the family come in the morning at around 8am last week, chasing after the chicken with a fishing net.

> ""The two adults, each holding a fishing net. I wanted to use my phone to take photo but it was too late,"" he said.

> The coffee shop employee also observed that the family targeted the hens mostly.

> As a result, there are only the roosters and some chicks left in the area now.

> A resident told the reporter that they did not look like they were sent by the authorities and they have abducted close to 20 chickens in three days.

> Given the number of chickens that they took away, she does not think that they will be kept as pets.

> This resident also pointed out that most of the residents are used to hearing the calls of the rooster in the morning.

> Another resident shared that there might be hygiene concerns when there are too many of them.

> Currently, there are about 20 chickens left.

I have been there before (not that I enjoyed the smoke or was there willingly), and the thing I enjoy the most is how the temple brought people together on religious festivals and celebrate the culture and traditions of the believers of Chinese folk religion.

744,27,g5s7fpa,t1_g5s3lo8,"Since your argument against folk religion (as compared to smokers) is that smokers can hide in their homes and lock their windows and smoke (or go somewhere deserted where the smoke affects noone), but folk religion people can‚Äôt, let me introduce you to this invention our geniuses in the government has came up with.

>	The canisters, which were piloted last year, come with lids which prevent ash from flying out, and have holes to improve air flow for more efficient burning. Just 3 per cent of ash is produced with the new burners, compared to conventional open-top red metal burners.

Since you don‚Äôt want a complete ban on smokers because you believe that they can be responsible enough to only smoke only in their own homes, I‚Äôm sure that same argument can apply to the folk-religionists, who surely can also be responsible enough to burn at these eco-friendly incense burners.

But let me guess, smokers can be taught to be responsible enough but in your mind, the folk religionists are reckless people that burns everywhere, so this won‚Äôt convince you a thing. Either you are irrationally hating the folk religionists, or you have never seen smokers before.

(Now, if anyone wondering why people still burn outside those canisters, there are some possible explanations. I will explain some that I know of.

If the canisters are too far away, people might not want to burn there, maybe for fear that the offerings might not get delivered or something. Maybe some priest should be recruited and think of a solution for that. 

The canisters are very heavy, so don‚Äôt expect a single middle aged person to carry it over. 

As for why the incense paper fly all over the place, try throwing *loose pieces of paper* into an updraft. Do that and you *will* know why it fly all over the place. Don‚Äôt forget hot air rises. For that, maybe also get a priest for that to justify throwing entire stacks at once as opposed to loose pieces.)",t3_iv8psi,19-09-2020

> SINGAPORE: Tower Transit Singapore has been awarded contracts for the Bulim and Sembawang-Yishun bus packages for a five-year period, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said in a news release on Wednesday (Sep 30).

> The contracts are worth about S$1.03 billion, said LTA, adding that they will progressively start from the second quarter of 2021.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The Sembawang-Yishun package, currently operated by SMRT Buses, consists of 27 bus services. They will operate from the new Mandai Depot, which will be handed over to Tower Transit by October.

> Tower Transit will also manage Sembawang and Yishun bus interchanges.

> 

> The Bulim package, which consists of 29 bus services, is already being operated by Tower Transit. It will continue to manage Bukit Batok and Jurong East bus interchanges.

> TRANSITION OF AFFECTED WORKERS

> LTA said SMRT employees affected by the changes must be offered jobs by the incoming operator, adding that their employment terms should not be worse than the terms they were under before the transition.

> ""Affected SMRT employees of the Sembawang-Yishun bus package will be protected by the Guidelines on Good Employment Practices in the Public Bus Industry,"" LTA said.

> ""All employees affected by new tender or change in bus service contracts must be offered a job by the incoming operator.""

> In a Facebook post, Executive Secretary of the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU) Melvin Yong said the union will work closely with SMRT and Tower Transit to ensure a ""smooth transition"" for affected workers.

> ""The union is committed to working with the different public transport operators to take care of our bus workers and create a safe working environment for them,"" Mr Yong said.

> The tender for the Bulim and Sembawang-Yishun bus packages was called in November last year, and bus operators had the option to bid for either bus package or for both.

> 

> Tower Transit was awarded the contract for the combined package, because it received the highest total score taking into account both price and quality factors in its proposal, said LTA.

> 

> ""If TTS (Tower Transit Singapore) performs well during the five-year term, LTA has the option to extend the contract term by another two years at the end of the five-year contract,"" added the authority.

> Party members distributed hand sanitiser to members of the public, including shopkeepers.

> So far, about 10 party members are interested in standing for election, and the NSP is still reviewing them before unveiling its slate of candidates, Mr Ng added.

> The applicants include entrepreneurs and professionals from the IT and logistics sectors who are aged between the late 20s and early 50s, he said.

> The NSP joins a growing number of opposition parties that have indicated where they will contest for the GE, which is expected to be held in the next few months following the release of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee's report earlier this month.

> Most parties have said they would run in the constituencies that they contested in 2015.

> But the entry of newly formed Progress Singapore Party (PSP), led by former People's Action Party veteran MP Tan Cheng Bock, has raised the possibility of multi-cornered fights.

> The PSP earlier indicated that it would contest 15 constituencies, including West Coast GRC, Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, Sembawang GRC, Pioneer SMC, Radin Mas SMC and the new Marymount SMC.

> The NSP, Reform Party (RP) and Singapore People‚Äôs Party (SPP) have staked their claim on these constituencies as well.

> RP said in a post on its Facebook page on Saturday (March 21) that it ""will continue to serve the residents by contesting in West Coast GRC, Ang Mo Kio GRC and Radin Mas SMC"".

> SPP has said it will field candidates in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC as well as Potong Pasir, Marymount and Mountbatten SMCs.

> Party chairman Jose Raymond will be its candidate in Potong Pasir, while secretary-general Steve Chia will lead a team to contest in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.

> Singapore Democratic Alliance chairman Desmond Lim Bak Chuan told The Straits Times that the party will be contesting in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

> The party has contested there since 2006 and has been working the ground since, he added.

> ""We will continue to contest in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC... We suggest (for opposition parties) to go elsewhere. Don't duplicate our actions and waste resources,"" Mr Lim said.

> NSP's Mr Ng said his party is set to meet PSP on Monday for talks, adding that while multi-cornered fights risk duplicating resources, they are a sign of democracy at work. ""It's kind of messy, but that's democracy,"" he said.

> His party could see a three-way fight in Tampines GRC as well, as the Workers' Party has been seen walking the ground there. The WP has yet to announce the wards it will be contesting.

1145,27,e4tficl,t3_9a73ew,"Someone most probably called pest control on an active colony or swarm.

The 4 honeybee species we have here in Singapore are migratory to some extent, and depending on the availability of nectar and other environmental conditions, the entire colony will often pack up and leave a nest site in search of a better location. In other cases, the colony has grown so large that it splits into two, with one forming a swarm that leaves to establish another colony elsewhere.

As they travel about, the swarm or new colony might end up attracting unwanted attention from people, who often don't take too kindly to having bees nearby - a shame really, because not all bee species are aggressive, and a swarm doesn't necessarily need to be eradicated if it's simply passing through and isn't that close to people.

Another scenario is that a nuptial flight has taken place - drones (males) and virgin queens from several honeybee colonies have emerged, congregated, and had a massive orgy in the air. For a drone, his only purpose in life is to find a virgin queen from another colony, fight off all the other drones competing for the same female, and mate with her. However, the act of ejaculation is so forceful that it practically rips his penis (technically called the endophallus) from his body, along with some of his internal organs. So the drone dies and drops off, his guts literally spilling out of his body. Talk about going out with a bang.

Meanwhile, the young queen will continue to fly around, pursued by other drones. She will mate with multiple males during her nuptial flight, which will provide her with all the sperm she needs to produce young for the rest of her life.

So if you find a bunch of dead bees, and instead of mostly workers, they all turn out to be drones with their guts sticking out, a nuptial flight had taken place.",t3_9a73ew,25-08-2018
