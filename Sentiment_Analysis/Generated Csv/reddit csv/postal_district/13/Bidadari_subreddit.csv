We've been invited to select a flat in June for the Toa Payoh SBF and we're looking at the balance of flats in Bidadari (not much left mostly first 3 floors). Im wondering if this is worth choosing over a high floor in Ubi grove? Since our queue number in Ubi is pretty good. 

In terms of locations, both are quite convenient to travel to work and they are both near our parent's place.

Your opinion is very much appreciated! :) 

Edit: thanks for the replies! I can afford the flat hahahaha I thought that was the obvious assumption. "
