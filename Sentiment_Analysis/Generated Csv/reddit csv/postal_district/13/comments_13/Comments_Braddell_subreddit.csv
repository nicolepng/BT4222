80,13,e5wo9ja,t3_9femal,"I don't know what it is with Singaporean mentality - whether in a car or on a bike - both sets have utter disregard for more vulnerable road users (ie. pedestrians).

I remember when I was learning how to rollerblade and was in Sydney, Bondi beach, along the footpath on a sunny weekend - there were loads of pedestrians/cyclists/rollerbladers - I fell in front of a cyclist and that guy suddenly stopped and fell off his bike in a bid not to hit me - we both got up and he immediately came over and asked me if I was ok! (I'm a guy, if you were wondering).

In Singapore, I fell off my bike on the ECP and everyone just looked at me, no one asked, no one helped me up.

I don't know what it is - are we just Aholes with a capital ""A""?",t3_9femal,13-09-2018
