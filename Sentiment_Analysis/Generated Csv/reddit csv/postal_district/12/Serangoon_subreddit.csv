7,12,Old Homeless Woman at Serangoon NEX,343,jhoyo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jhoyo8/old_homeless_woman_at_serangoon_nex/,21,25-10-2020,"**TLDR: Lost my wallet after accidentally passing it to a homeless woman at the NEX taxi stand. If anyone knows of her whereabouts please PM me!**

&#x200B;

So I lost my wallet at NEX yesterday because I mistakenly had my wallet inside the plastic bag of food that I passed to a homeless lady at the NEX taxi stand yesterday night at around 1AM. (Yeah I know dumb move but we were in a rush cuz the taxi was there)

&#x200B;

Ironically, I only realised it was gone when I was home and I wanted to go back to check on her and pass her some cash. So of course, I rushed down to check if she was still there. By the time I reached it was 2AM plus already and she wasn't at the taxi stand anymore. The NEX security at the check in wasn't sure where she went so we did a sweep of the mall esp the toilets cuz she said she usually rests there. Got stopped by security after an hour because we weren't supposed to roam around the mall at that timing. They took down my details (pretty sure the uncle was shaking his head in disbelief at how blur I was) and said they know of this auntie and will let me know if they find her. Usually they see her visit the toilet at night and would loiter around the taxi stand at NEX. They don't allow people to loiter so she most likely gets asked to leave if they see her.

&#x200B;

By the time we left it was pouring heavily outside and I'm just left with one question: Where the hell could the auntie have went? It seems like she's a regular in the area so if anyone has seen her and knows where she usually is, it would be great help for me to recover my wallet. Most noticeably, her legs are badly scratched or scarred, most likely from diabetes, she had a lot of bags with her and her hair was greying I would say she's in her 50s or 60s. I've already called the social services and reported her case, also submitted a form on [homeless.sg](https://homeless.sg) but if anyone has other suggestions will be open to hear them too if I meet her again.

&#x200B;

\*Caveat\* but I'm broke recent grad that just started working so quite heart pain to lose my wallet lol esp since I have a cash card worth $180 inside that I mostly likely can't recover and also NRIC replacement is another whooping $100. I doubt the auntie would do anything with my wallet but I'm worried she might misplace it then GG. Would really appreciate any leads on this! Happy Sunday to everyone who bothered reading till the end:)

UPDATE: I found my wallet! Thank you for the well-wishes from everyone in this thread, I am very encouraged by your words. Also those who offered to chip in! I haven’t managed to thank everyone individually but I really appreciate your offers. I could be an internet scam for all you know but I am very touched by the trust in the community.

I reached at 12am the yesterday, just nice when the social workers reached as well. Was thinking of the worst that I wouldn’t see the lady but she was there. Somehow she recognised me even though it was a passing interaction. She told me that she was waiting for me at the taxi stand for me today, hoping I would pass by again - she couldn’t get to my house from the address on my NRIC because of her leg condition. She was so excited and genuinely nice about it that I started to feel bad - it’s mixed emotions but all I can say is sometimes you want to believe that the world is fair and that good people don’t ever get into bad situations but I guess this is not one of the cases. 

The social workers told me they would try to access her case and evaluate the best next course of action. They did say they will try to get her home (although I wonder if she’s a rough sleeper, she most likely not have one?) but they were quite tight-lipped about it, I’m guessing for privacy issues. This whole incident did kind of leave me with a lot more questions though. The social worker that called me did mention that they had her case in her system so I’m wondering how she ended up back at this state if she previously seemed to have received help? Is this a choice? Especially, since she seemed to be in a perfectly sound state of mind to seek help, why hasn’t she? I honestly wish I had the time to speak to her more to understand her situation better, but my only hope is that the social workers are able to help her get the help that she needs. 

UPDATE 2: The social worker called and told me that the lady got medical attention for her legs after they visited her yesterday. She’s in the hospital now. The social worker mentioned the lady does actually have a house - she lives with her son but they are apparently not in good terms which is why she choses to be outside instead. The social worker said that she should be assigned someone to her case after her discharge from the hospital to negotiate relations between her son and her and hopefully get her to be okay staying home. She told me to look out for the her in case she goes back to loitering around NEX, since she wasn’t very open to receiving help the last time. It does seem that she is getting help now so here’s an update for anyone who is concerned for her:)

PSA: for anyone who have seen recurring rough sleepers around your neighbourhood, one way you can help is by calling ComCare at this number: 1800-2220000

Their hotline runs from 7AM-12 midnight daily so it’s pretty easy to reach them. They will ask you a couple of questions to identify the person, if you are able to take a photo of the person, it would be best and get any contact information from them, like their name and number. Hopefully, this helps anyone who isn’t sure about how to help homeless people they’ve seen around, the whole process was very convenient and efficient, they went down to find her on the day I called them

Oh no! The wild monkey fled!

And began feasting on the mango tree outside her place. I don’t know what happened but presuming that it fled after eating the mangoes, it’s likely that it “da-baoed” the mango and scurried off

She then called NEA and they said it was a stray monkey( it was only one )

I’m curious if any of you have seen it and I hope that the monkey found it’s way back into the forest
