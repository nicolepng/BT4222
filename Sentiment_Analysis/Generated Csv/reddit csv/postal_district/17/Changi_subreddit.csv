For the foodies who prefer unique experiences, better categorized. Made so foreigners don‚Äôt go reading ‚Äúbest Jewel Changi Airport food‚Äù articles and think only fast food options like A&W, Shake Shack and Pink Fish are worth eating in Jewel Changi.

While reporters, journalists, bloggers and Instagrammers swamp to the new Jewel Changi Airport reporting news about long queues for A&W, selected lists of eateries, and first looks to jump on the hype train, I‚Äôm taking a slower approach to bring you the real dining guide to maximizing your visit to Jewel by listing the directory of 112 dining options into better categories.

Disclaimer: Again, not sponsored, but I am a food blogger/writer wanna-be. I wrote a few articles researching the origins of certain foods.

# Categorizing Method

I try to use community based reviews to support building this list. Within each category it‚Äôs arranged alphabetical order.

For Michelin awarded stalls: The awards don‚Äôt belong to the brand, but is given to only one of the stores. Since these stores all newly opened, any Michelin award refers to the other branch. Whether this translates to the store here is another matter.

# Exciting Options Worth Trying

## For Foreigners - Actual Local Food

Unique Singaporean food hits this category. Foreigners should eat something from this list.

&#x200B;

FEI SIONG

\#B2-267

Daily: 24 hours

Serves local noodles (Mee Pok, Bak Chor Mee, Fish ball noodles) and beverages (Teh/Tea, Coffee/Kopi). Not exciting for Singaporeans since Fei Siong is pretty commonly found in malls, but for foreigners this is a good gateway into our local cuisine. The company started in 1993 selling Fishball noodles, but expanded to become a chain of various food establishments serving local food.

&#x200B;

FIVE SPICE

\#B2-238/239/240

Daily: 24 hours

A food court serving a curated list of local food. In their own words, ‚Äú As the gateway to Singapore‚Äôs diverse food scene for travellers and locals alike, individually designed stalls are set up to encapsulate the flavours of local and neighbouring cuisines within Southeast Asia.‚Äù A good place to eat for all, travellers and locals alike.

&#x200B;

FUN TOAST

\#04-246

Daily: 10am ‚Äì 10pm

Founded in 1941 serving Nanyang (South East Asia) coffee and kaya toasts. Not exciting for Singaporeans since pretty commonly found in malls, but for foreigners this is a good gateway into our local culture.

&#x200B;

HAWKER

\#B2-263

Daily: 24 hours

Serves Singapore-inspired burgers, wraps, and desserts, fast food form. A peek into our local culture if you only have 5 minutes to spare, but otherwise I don‚Äôt see much of a point for travellers. Somewhat exciting for Singaporeans since this is something we can call ‚ÄúMcDonald‚Äôs with local flavors‚Äù, but won‚Äôt hit close to our ‚ÄòMust try‚Äô lists.

&#x200B;

JUMBO SEAFOOD

\#03-202/203/204

&#x200B;

MAO SHAN WANG BY FOUR SEASONS DURIANS

\#B2-227/228

Daily: 24 hours

It‚Äôs hard to say that Durian is uniquely Singaporean, since we import the fruit, but eating Durian is definitely part of the Singaporean experience. Serves a variety of durian desserts. Durian desserts are typically less strong than the actual fruit, so it can be a good starting point for those who want to try the fruit. Throughout history people actually [like the fruit](https://justafatboi.com/durian-origin/) so don‚Äôt dismiss it without trying.

&#x200B;

MR. COCONUT

&#x200B;

SONG FA BAK KUT TEH

\#B2-278/279/280

WHITE RESTAURANT

Daily: 10am ‚Äì 10pm

Serves White Bee Hoon/White Rice Vermicelli and other Tze Char. No, this isn‚Äôt [Singapore Noodles](https://justafatboi.com/singapore-noodles-origins/)‚Ä¶ Although White Bee Hoon is claimed to be pretty unique to Singapore.

&#x200B;

ICENOIE HOKKAIDO

&#x200B;

COFFEE@WORKS

\#02-237

&#x200B;

TOKYO MILK CHEESE FACTORY & COW COW KITCHEN

\#B2-265

Daily: 24 hours

Japanese cookies, cake, ice cream from a chain in Tokyo (9 stores, and 6 overseas). On another note, their slogan <‚Äú„Åª„Åä„Åå„Åä„Å°„Çã‚Äù (Hoppe ga ochiru) which literally means ‚ÄúYour Cheeks Drop‚Äú> bothered me a bit since the Hiragana and romaji are different. Though, I don‚Äôt know enough Japanese culture to know if that is acceptable.

&#x200B;

## Established Local Brands

These are brands that Singaporeans will be familiar with. Not necessarily uniquely Singaporean food.

**For Tourists and one-stop travellers**: Most food here aren‚Äôt unique to Singapore, but may have a certain Singaporean flair to them.

**Singaporeans**: No reason to travel to Jewel just to eat this.

&#x200B;

A-ONE SIGNATURE

\#B2-200

&#x200B;

PUTIEN

\#02-249

Daily: 10am ‚Äì 10pm

Serves Heng Hwa or Putian food. It‚Äôs focus is on the flavors from Fujian, China, so this definitely isn‚Äôt uniquely Singaporean. However Putian flavors became popular very quickly and can now be found in many food courts and hawker centers. One Michelin Star.

&#x200B;

SAMSUI

\#03-201

Daily: 10am ‚Äì 10pm

Opened in 1991, now has about 15 locations in Singapore. Known for their Samsui Ginger Chicken, a traditional dish made by Samsui women in Singapore during the 1920s to 1940s and Herbal Soups. Samsui Ginger Chicken is also known as White Cut Chicken or Bai Qie Ji in China and Hong Kong, so it remains debatable as to whether this should be something foreigners must try.

&#x200B;

# Newer Local Brands

**For Tourists and one-stop travellers**: Avoid if your aim is to find food unique to Singapore. Great if you just want to eat the world and don‚Äôt care about Singaporean food.

&#x200B;

SWATOW KITCHEN Ê±ïÂ§¥Â∞èÂêÉ

A small chain of restaurants serving Teochew cuisine from Swatow, Guangdong. Opened in 2010, though there was another ‚ÄúSwatow Restaurant Group‚Äù that closed in 1992. I have no idea whether these two chains are affiliated. From the name, this branch seems to serve small bites.

New brands that nobody knows how they will fare.

New concept. Designer-Art Toys themed cafe. Not opened yet but apparently serves Japanese food.

Daily: 24 hours

Serves Chicken and Rice dishes.

&#x200B;

HERIT8GE

\#05-206

Daily: 9am ‚Äì 3am

European with local flavors. Definitely not traditional local, so I find it hard to introduce this to any foreigners. For locals, fusion dishes are always a hit or miss, so the reception remains to be seen.

&#x200B;

NAIISE ICONIC

\#02-205/206

Daily: 10am ‚Äì 10pm

Coming soon.

&#x200B;

O‚ÄôTAH

\#B2-241

&#x200B;

Xiao Bin Lou Â∞èÊª®Ê•º

\#02-208/209

A restaurant in Chongqing, China. Jewel‚Äôs site says this is popular in Chongqing, but while there are online reviews, it seems mixed and looks generally unreliable.

&#x200B;

YU‚ÄôS KITCHEN

\#03-208

Daily: 10am ‚Äì 10pm

Four dining institutions from Chongqing are aggregated here; Wu Wonton, Zhengdong Dan Dan Noodles, De Yuan and Qiu Er Guan. Regardless of their reputation back in Chongqing, the initial reviews for Yu‚Äôs Kitchen seem to be really bad.

# Big International Brands

Brands you probably already heard of unless you live under a rock. Have hundreds of chains around the world.

**For Tourists and one-stop travellers**: Safe options with good quality control and consistent standards. Avoid if your aim is to find food unique to Singapore.

**Singaporeans**: No reason to travel to Jewel just to eat this.

CAF√â&MEAL MUJI

\#02-227/228/229

They were worried sick about it and I helped to lodge an lost and found report online through the airport website and also called their enquiry helpline to provide as much details as we had about the item but at the time of the call, it was not found yet. 

After a couple of hours, we decided to head back to the Airport to ask the information help desk in person and thank goodness! Someone had found it and handed it in so we managed to get it back. The staff whom we spoke to were all very courteous and professional. Thank you so much for the help! And Thank you to the people to found it for us, whoever you maybe!"

Singapore doesn't really have a Motorsports culture (try asking the average man to name a Singaporean race driver without using Google), so there isn't much motorsport related stuff I can write about linking to Singapore. Today happens to mark the 10th anniversary of the Ground Breaking Ceremony for the Changi Motorsports Hub, and I've taken this chance to do a writeup on the whole saga, which most have forgotten.

If you like it, feel it can be improved, or have differing thoughts about the subject, do comment down below! It'll be gladly appreciated. If you want the link to the original, alongside a complete list of my sources, it's in the comments. \[\] Is the link to each statement.

*Every saga has its origin. The 13th of July 2020 marks the tenth anniversary of what should have been a historical day in the history of Motorsport in Singapore. A day that should have marked the beginning of a bright new era for Motorsport in Singapore. A bright future that never came, and remains forgotten.*

Every 2 years, the skies above Changi East are filled with the roar of low-flying military aircraft performing aerobatics during the bi-annual Singapore Airshow, held at the Changi Exhibition Centre. For the remainder of the 2 years, Changi East remains a relatively quiet place, with most of the noise in the area coming from airliners taking off from the adjacent Changi Airport.

However, this was never meant to be the case. Changi East was planned to be the site of Singapore‚Äôs first Permanent Racing Circuit, with the circuit being located adjacent to the CEC. Despite this, the Circuit was never meant to replace the Marina Bay Street Circuit, where the Singapore Grand Prix is run yearly. The Changi Motorsports Hub was planned to instead complement the Marina Bay Street Circuit, allowing for Motorsport activities on a year-round basis.

Contrary to common belief, the Changi Motorsports Hub was not the first Permanent Motor Racing Circuit for cars which was planned in Singapore. The first to be planned was the Tuas International Speedway in 2005, which was never built. (Part of the site was later used for a Motocross track, Circuit@Tuas, which closed in the early 2010s.) The Changi Motorsports Hub progressed further than the Tuas International Speedway, being built, albeit as far as a bunch of piles sticking out of the sand it was built upon....

# Origins

Plans for the Changi Motorsports Hub were first revealed in an article published on the 17th of October 2007, titled: ‚ÄúMotorsports to put Changi on fast track‚Äù , written by Samuel Ee. Despite this, no news on the project was announced until 31st March 2009, when the Singapore Sports Council (now known as Sport Singapore) released a Request For Proposal (RFP) to build and develop the Changi Motorsports Hub. The RFP dateline was the 27th of August 2009.

In the Press Release, the SSC announced the site of the racetrack would be a 41 hectre site located next to the Changi Exhibition Centre. The following minimum specifications were laid out[\[1\]](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/newsroom/media-releases/2009/3/singapore-invites-internationals-to-bid-for-asias-first-integrated-motorsports-and-leisure-hub):

* Minimum 3.5-kilometre long FIA Grade 2 Circuit
* A single permanent sheltered grandstand for at least 8,000 pax, with an unobstructed view of the whole circuit.

## The 3 Bids

On Monday, 7th of November 2009, the three organisations bidding for the Changi Motorsports Hub presented their plans to the media. The organisations & their bid details were as follows[\[2\]](https://www.asiaone.com/News/The%2BBusiness%2BTimes/Story/A1Story20090908-166499.html):

### Singapore Agro Agricultural (SAA)

The then-operator of Turf City (now known as The Grandstand), which was also behind the initial plans for the Tuas International Circuit, that was later cancelled.

* Project Name: Changi International Speedway (CIS)
* 4.37 KM Track meeting FIM Grade 1 & FIA Grade 2, with room for upgrading to FIA Grade 1 status
* Secured rights to host a MotoGP Night Race.
* Est Cost: 200-250 Million SGD

### Sport Services

A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Haw Par Corporation

* 4.2 KM Track designed by Hermann Tilke, meeting FIM Grade 1 & FIA Grade 1T
* Letters of Intent were signed with the SuperGT & the V8 Supercars Championship
* Motorsports Country Club for 3000 individuals will be created to recoup costs of operation and development
* Est Cost: 200 Million SGD+

### SG Changi

Consortium with shareholders from Japan and Singapore. Auto Trading Luft Japan was involved in the financing of the project.

* 3.7 KM track meeting FIA Grade 2 standards
* Letters of Interest were announced for the FIA GT Championship, Super GT, Formula Nippon (now known as Super Formula) and Japanese Formula 3.
* The proposal included an R&D Facility, Motorsport Museum and a Hotel
* Est Cost: 280 Million SGD

On the 26th of March 2010, the SSC announced it had selected SG Changi to develop, build, finance and manage the facility. The targeted completion date was by the end of 2011, with the track being expected to be ready for use ahead of the 2012 racing season.

## SG Changi Project Details

In the SSC‚Äôs press release, SG Changi‚Äôs final proposal was included. Key Details are listed below[\[3\]](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/newsroom/media-releases/2010/3/sg-changi-wins-bid-for-changi-motorsports-hub):

### Racing Circuit

* Racing circuit with 6 different configurations, inclusive of a Karting Track
* Main Circuit (Circuit 01) will be 3.7 KM long
* Karting Track will be 1.1 KM long
* 3 Pit Complexes included within the development, 2 Permanent (Main & Karting Pits), 1 Temporary (Secondary Pits)
* The Direction of travel was not mentioned but is believed to be Clockwise

#### TRACK MAP

## Developmental Process

### Ground Breaking Ceremony & Piling Work

On the 13th of July 2010, a groundbreaking ceremony was held at Aviation Park Road, with invited guests witnessing a drifting event on the day. Following the groundbreaking ceremony, SGChangi announced it would begin construction in August of the year. [\[4\]](https://web.archive.org/web/20100716130431/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1069158/1/.html)

In construction, piling is one of the critical early steps that are required before any building work can begin. Despite SGChangi‚Äôs announcements, the piling contracts were only awarded in October, with piling works only beginning in December. CSC Holdings were appointed as contractors for the piling works.

Piling work lasted a mere 1 and a half months, with CSC halting any further piling work in the middle of January. This was reportedly due to SG Changi failing to pay an instalment to CSC. At the time of stoppage, only 1000 of the 6000 points had piled into the ground. SGChangi also came under probing from the Corrupt Practices Investigatory Bureau (CPIB) during this time.[\[5\]](https://www.asiaone.com/News/The%2BBusiness%2BTimes/Story/A1Story20110106-256794.html)

In August 2011, CSC Holdings terminated its contract with SGChangi. On 12 December 2011, the SSC announced it would move towards the mutual termination of it‚Äôs contract with SGChangi.

In an interview with The Straits Times in late December 2011, consortium chairman Fuminori Murahashi revealed the CPIB probe had been the result of a tip-off from himself. He had been alerted about an email exchange between an SGChangi employee and an SSC official, which reportedly contained a job offer with SGC in the event of the consortium winning the bid. [\[6\]](https://www.stcars.sg/guides-articles/sg-changi-boss-still-keen-on-motorsports-hub-37274)

### Post-SGChangi

Despite the SSC announcing it would terminate the SGC Contract, The Straits Times reported in late January that the return of the site to the Government was being delayed. This was due to SGC being concerned over a particular aspect of the Contract, with a clause stating that any refund on  
the $36 million SG Changi paid for the land lease was tied to a second tender exercise. As a result, SGC appeared to be reluctant to accept the proposal to terminate the contract, if it was unable to minimally recover the $36 million, without the involvement of a second tender process. [\[7\]](https://www.stcars.sg/guides-articles/motorsports-hub-hits-fresh-set-of-obstacles-40685)

On the 15th of May 2012, the SSC officially terminated its agreement with SG Changi, 6 months after it announced it would terminate its deal with the SGC. The SSC repossessed the land on 17th of May 2012. SSC CEO Lim Teck Yin stated that the land could be used for non-motorsports purposes, announcing a market sounding exercise will be carried out to assess the level of interest among potential investors for a motorsports hub or other sports and lifestyle concepts.[\[8\]](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/changi-motorsports-hub-set-lease-life-120152591.html)

### The End of the Road

Despite having received seven proposals from six organisations during the RFI period after November 2012, on the 12 of June 2013, the SSC announced it would not be proceeding with the re-tender for the site. The SSC announced it would proceed to reinstate the land, working with the authorities on the feasibility of an early handover of the land back for alternative uses. [\[9\]](https://www.myactivesg.com/read/2013/6/changi-motorsports-hub-called-off)

With that, the curtain seemingly fell on the CMH, a project that saw much promise but ultimately proved to be a false dawn for Motorsport in Singapore. Despite this, Changi East did see some motorsport action in the form of the Changi Karting Circuit, which opened in 2013, on a short term lease, closing in 2014.

### Aftermath

In April 2014, nearly a year after it was announced that the CMH would be scrapped, the site was left virtually untouched. The Straits Times saw the site still littered with Piles, with SGChangi having yet to remove the piles. Later, it was found that the complete extraction of the installed piles was not feasible, as engineers evaluated and realised that the removal of the piles could lead to the weakening of nearby sea walls. An alternate plan was devised to cut the pillars at a shallow depth beneath the ground. [\[10\]](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/failed-race-track-project-site-not-cleared-a-year-on)

In late October 2014, the SSC, rebranded as Sport Singapore, announced that it had returned the site to the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) earlier in the month and returned the remainder of the 40 million SGChangi had paid for the land to the consortium. SGChangi repaid its debt to CSC Holdings in the same month.[\[11\]](https://www.todayonline.com/sports/motor-racing/sg-changi-settles-motorsports-hub-debts)

In November 2015, it was revealed by The Straits Times that the site was to be¬†reserved for industries supporting the future Changi Airport Terminal 5. [\[12\]](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-use-for-ex-changi-motorsports-hub-site) Since then, no mention of the Changi Motorsports Hub or SGChangi has ever been made in the media again."
