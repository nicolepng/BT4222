0,21,erdjnq7,t3_c1hhn1,"Cool sighting of a pair of [Clouded Monitors](http://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/lizards/clouded_monitor.htm) fighting. I haven't been lucky enough to observe this behaviour in Clouded Monitors, I've only seen this in the [Malayan Water Monitors](https://flic.kr/p/9pPZ1M) at [Sungei Buloh](https://youtu.be/lVp9qHLuuS8) so far.

And yes, they're [fighting](https://youtu.be/K_9u-KF3BqI), not mating. This is a [test of strength and endurance](https://youtu.be/Kpb_KOBwn2U) between males, and whoever manages to [pin his rival to the ground](https://youtu.be/jpxgWjj4tKw) wins. It's a way to [sort out the hierarchy](https://youtu.be/gaPk2zrH_KA), and for larger individuals to [demonstrate their dominance](https://youtu.be/Atw_VSdTx-4), without resorting to more violent fights that could result in one or even both of them being fatally wounded. Because of the way these monitors grab each other with the front limbs, you'll often see old males with [lots of scarring](https://flic.kr/p/9pSs77) on the shoulders and upper back.

[Wrestling](https://youtu.be/rvC8qftEA7A) seems to be [prevalent](https://youtu.be/HdQBlXub3iM) in the monitor lizard family; even the Komodo Dragon, largest of the monitor lizards, also [engages in this behaviour](https://youtu.be/m63vUqtFbEE).

[Mating](https://youtu.be/UIfqakHM2L0) in monitor lizards is [a much gentler affair](https://youtu.be/ZJ7XqT0eidw) - you'll see both of them on the ground, with [their tails intertwined](https://youtu.be/ZX30uurdjdw) - the female is below, and she has to [lift her tail up and to the side](https://youtu.be/4pdC2kyZ0Vw) so that her cloaca (the single opening at the base of the tail that reptiles and birds use for pooping, peeing, and mating) can [make contact with the male's](https://youtu.be/pQW6PZL0MiU). The male will then evert his hemipenes (lizards and snakes have two penis-like organs), and insert one of them into the female's cloaca.",t3_c1hhn1,17-06-2019
