# Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery

 Cao Can (sometimes spelt as Cao Cen; also known as Sek Koh Sam), a master of Shaolin martial arts, was appointed the monastery‚Äôs 12th abbot in 1948. He sought the help of Low‚Äôs descendants to fund repair works for parts of the monastery that had been damaged during the war. Cao also shared his martial arts skills with Toa Payoh residents, as well as enrolled students, to equip them with adequate self-defence against gangsters. Many of the martial arts schools in Singapore can trace their lineage to him and his disciples.

1. How can molecules and atoms be reconstituted together again when a person has been cremated into ash? The process of cremation enforces information entropy onto these molecules that constitutes a person's body, and also a lot of these molecules are lost as a consequence to the combustion process.

2. When buried, the body has been altered by the environment through chemical, biological and physical process of decomposition, small insects consuming the body, and the weight of the topsoil crushing the body into semi-structural pieces before the passing of time caused the bones to disintegrate. You mean that when the time comes, the particles that are now absorbed by the animals and plants gets sucked out of them and get reconstituted into the person's body and he can rise up again?

>          SINGAPORE - A 16-year-old boy fell from the 12th floor of a Housing Board block in Toa Payoh in the wee hours of Tuesday (Jan 23) and died.
The police told The Straits Times that they were alerted to the case of a fall from height at Block 79D, Toa Payoh Central, at 12.28am on Tuesday.
""A 16-year-old boy was found lying motionless and was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene,"" said a spokesman for the police. ST understands that the teenager, Ng Jun Hui, was with a female friend at the time.
She reportedly said that he lost his balance and fell. Shin Min Daily News said in a report on Thursday, quoting the teenager&apos;s father, that the pair were playing a game that was ""like hide-and-seek"" at the sky garden.
Police are investigating the unnatural death.

If you continue in this stretch of road, it will be almost completely dark as there are no street lamps around this area and you'll hit a dead-end which is also barricaded and leads to the highway yet again (not a very impressive stretch of road if you ask me). If you walk through this stretch in the day, of course it will not be dark as there is no shelter for this road.

579,12,g4wxmuz,t3_ir8rqy,I studied the google map view and it seems like an abandoned/ulu road and not mainly a walkway. There is a walkway link to the Whampoa estate at only one part near Blk 108 Jalan Rajah. There is also a sign at the start of this road that this path is only for authorized vehicles. My best bet is that this can serve as a fire engine trunk road just in case any of those buildings are on fire and they do not need to make a whole round into Whampoa itself to access these buildings.,t3_ir8rqy,12-09-2020

You can also access this place via the bus stop ""Opp Blk 195"" right along the highway through a barricade that can be used by emergency vehicles like a firetruck.

Our society runs perfectly fine on rules that basically devalue the lives of people who fulfill any of the above. I don't think anyone would accidentally find themselves committing one of the above offences as a ""genuine mistake"" and somehow get the death penalty.

And to be honest, adding one more set of requirements, like perhaps ""perpetrating a violent crime within 1 month of release from prison regarding a previous violent crime"" wouldn't cause anyone to lose any sleep. Maybe it's just me and that I'm a bad person, but I don't feel sympathy for these kinds of people, just like I don't sympathize with anyone who does any of the above serious crimes.

Apart from the loud minority, the rest are clearly in silent agreement with the concept where people who do certain things don't deserve to enjoy a life in Singapore.

What's worth discussing are things within the realm of possibility. Like say, the removal or addition of certain clauses to our death penalty conditions, or the normalization of other punishments.

Feel free to hold your own opinions, but dont vilify other people for attempting to share their own ideas on the ethics of capital punishment. 

And no, one person's opinion is not as ""good as anyone else's"". The quality of your opinion is rooted in factual evidence, its objectivity and logic.

> According to Liaw, she was rather worried when the picture of Baby went viral after it was first featured on The Straits Times.

> However, she is relieved that it turned out to be a ""happy joy"" for a lot of people.

> Lee wrote in his post:

> Every poster and banner put up must have a sticker accompanying it. This sticker is one that is issued by ELD and can only be collected after nomination. The purpose of this sticker is to limit the number of posters and banners one can put up so as to try and level the playing field.

> According to the Elections Department Singapore, the official stamp issued by the Returning Officer is necessary.

> ELD wrote in their campaigning rules: ""All posters and banners displayed must bear the official stamp issued by the Returning Officer.""

> The stamp is needed to cap the total number of posters put up by one party in each constituency.

> Rules governing the quantity of posters and banners a political party can put up can be found in the latest candidate handbook for general election issued by ELD.

> According to the document, it wrote:

> At the end of nomination proceedings, the Returning Officer will issue to the candidate or his election agent a permit authorising the display of posters and banners in public places within the electoral division where the candidate is contesting in. Posters and banners may take the form of a small or large printed election advertising. The permit will specify the maximum number and size of small and large printed election advertising (whether in the form of a poster or a banner) allowed to be displayed in public places within the electoral division and may contain certain conditions restricting the type of printed election advertising authorised to be displayed, and the place at and manner in which they may be displayed. The formulae to compute the maximum number of small and large printed election advertising is as follows: Number of small printed election advertising allowed: 1 small printed election advertising to every 50 electors in the register (rounded to nearest 100) Subject to minimum of: ‚Ä¢ 500 per SMC ‚Ä¢ 2,000 per 4-MP GRC ‚Ä¢ 2,500 per 5-MP GRC

> SINGAPORE - A 66-year-old man sneezed and lost control of his car,¬†crashing into a¬†road divider in¬†Lorong 1 Toa Payoh on Thursday afternoon (April 19).

> The impact dislodged a lamp post,¬†causing¬†it to nearly topple over. Debris from the car was strewn over two lanes of the road.

> Mr¬†Abdul Rahman Hassan, who is unemployed, told The Straits Times that he was on his way to pick up¬†his three-year-old granddaughter from kindergarten in Upper Thomson Road when the accident occurred near Braddell MRT station at around 12.40pm.

> In response to queries from ST, the police said it was alerted to an accident involving a car in Lorong 1 Toa Payoh, in the direction of Lorong 6 Toa Payoh.

> Mr Abdul Rahman&apos;s blue Subaru¬†Impreza was badly damaged, but he was not injured. No other cars were involved.

> He said: ""I had a loud sneeze and then I realised I hit the divider and lamp post. I was not scared. Accidents can happen.

> ""Anyway, my car needs¬†to be scrapped next year. If I can&apos;t repair¬†it, I will just scrap it.""

>

> A cobbler in his 60s, who wanted to be known only as Mr Yong, said he heard a loud screech followed by a bang.¬†

> ""I didn&apos;t see¬†the collision, but I was shocked by the crash, as it was very loud. Many people were curious and went to take a look.""

> Sales executive Muhammad Hafiz Khamzah, 21, was making a U-turn at the road junction when he heard a loud crash.

> ""It was so scary when I heard the crash. My heart stopped, but luckily the uncle is okay,"" he said.

> After a brief downpour, workers arrived at the scene with a crane at about 1.45pm and prepared to¬†dismantle and replace the damaged lamp post.¬†

> The lamp post was hoisted and removed from the site at about 2.10pm, with¬†the process lasting¬†about 20 minutes. The crane left soon after.

> A supervisor told ST that installing a new¬†lamp post¬†should take around four hours.

> Police investigations are ongoing.

> RC volunteers working closely with govt agencies to assist accused housewife and other residents

> Grassroots leaders are coordinating efforts with agencies to extend help to residents in a Punggol block where a 51-year-old housewife was accused of harassing her neighbours to the point of driving six households out.

> Meanwhile, the police have contacted the woman in question.

> The constituency‚Äôs MP, labour chief Ng Chee Meng, told The Sunday Times that its residents‚Äô committee (RC) volunteers are working closely with ‚Äúrelevant agencies, including community partners‚Äù to assist the housewife and the other residents.

> Mr Ng said: ‚ÄúThis is a complicated case with some history and we hope that an amicable outcome can be achieved.‚Äù

> An RC spokesman said agencies involved include the police, the HDB, the town council and representatives from the social services office.

> A police spokesman said that, for longstanding dispute cases such as the Punggol matter, the police will work with various agencies ‚Äúto engage the involved parties, with the aim of reaching an amicable outcome among all parties‚Äù.

> The police had previously said that reports filed by the housewife‚Äôs neighbours were for non-arrestable offences such as intentional harassment, noise pollution and mischief. They were thus advised to lodge a magistrate‚Äôs complaint.

> When contacted, the HDB said that neighbour disputes do not fall under its purview.

> The Sunday Times reported last week that six households living on the same floor as the housewife had moved out over the past two years. They complained that, since 2013, she had splashed oil at their doors, played loud music throughout the night and stomped on the floor. One said she left a pig‚Äôs ear on a shoe rack. Another said she had thrown a chair at him.

> The neighbours said they felt helpless despite multiple reports made to the police, grassroots organisations and the HDB.

> Police told them what the housewife did were non-arrestable offences, and attempts at court-directed mediation in 2017 failed when the housewife refused to agree to stop her actions.

> The case highlights the challenges of resolving neighbour disputes, especially in a dense city like Singapore where residents live cheek by jowl.

> Matters are complicated when one or more parties could be suffering from mental illnesses.

> It has emerged that the divorcee, who lives with her adult son, has moved several times and has a history of disputes with neighbours at her previous home in Toa Payoh.

> The Sunday Times learnt that she is estranged from her family who believe she could be mentally unwell. She had rejected their advances to help her. No one could say if she has been diagnosed.

> The housewife lived in a threeroom HDB flat in Bedok after her marriage. She and her husband later moved into an HDB flat in Sengkang.

> When the marriage broke down, the housewife and their son moved into a two-room HDB flat in Toa Payoh around 1999.

> During her first week there, the housewife was friendly towards her neighbours and even invited some of them to her home, said her former neighbours there, who asked not to be named.

> One 61-year-old neighbour recalled: ‚ÄúShe was very nice and asked me to go ‚Äòjalan jalan‚Äô (Malay for stroll) with her in Chinatown. She brought her son and I brought my daughter along.

> ‚ÄúBut her attitude changed very quickly. She did not disturb one neighbour. She disturbed many neighbours. She threw chicken bones outside my home and sugared biscuits into my flower pots so the ants came.‚Äù

> Multiple police reports were made and the elderly neighbour said she also took her complaint to court. A mediation session was held and the housewife subsequently stopped harassing the elderly neighbour .

> ‚ÄúBut still every night we heard the sounds ‚Äòbong bong bong bong‚Äô ‚Äì all of us couldn‚Äôt sleep. She used a pole to hit the ceiling and the floor. The old man who lived in a unit above hers moved out. He said he couldn‚Äôt take it,‚Äù the neighbour said.

> Neighbours both in Toa Payoh and Punggol felt that nothing could be done short of going to court.

> Agencies and grassroots organisations they contacted told them to be more tolerant, install CCTV cameras and to avoid contact with her.

> The police told The Sunday Times that ‚Äúif the arrested perpetrator is assessed to be of unsound mind, the police can commit the person to the Institute of Mental Health for mental health assessment and treatment‚Äù.

> A 24-year-old neighbour said he was once locked inside his flat because someone had stuck something into his padlock and he couldn‚Äôt open it with his key. His mother had to use a saw to break the lock. They believe the housewife was behind the mischief.

> Asked if the matter was reported to the police, he replied: ‚ÄúNo. She did so many things to my neighbours, they called the police but there was no use. It‚Äôs always the same officer who came down and he would tell us to just sweep and pick up the rubbish ourselves.‚Äù

> The neighbours said that the housewife did not have any visitors, even during festive seasons like Chinese New Year, and that she also believed that she was being spied on.

> In Toa Payoh, she had six to seven cameras installed outside her flat, as well as a big mirror that reflects the opposite lift lobby. Said the elderly neighbour: ‚ÄúWe complained to the RC about her cameras but she refused to remove them.‚Äù

> A neighbour who wanted to be known only as Mr Ng, 68, said: ‚ÄúEveryday she would be fighting with someone. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs normal. I think she could be mentally stressed by some personal problems. I hope someone will help her before something violent happens and someone gets injured physically. Then it will be too late.‚Äù

> SINGAPORE - The National Environment Agency (NEA) said on Thursday (March 28) that it is investigating after a video of a rat scurrying around the food trays of a Toa Payoh eatery began circulating on social media.

> In the clip, which was posted on Facebook on Wednesday, a number of roast ducks can also be seen hanging over the counter where the rat was. On Thursday, NEA told The Straits Times it has inspected the restaurant's premises following the incident.

> Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao reported that the eatery in the video was Lee Kwang Kee Teochew Cuisine, which is located at Toa Payoh Lorong 8.

> One of the staff in charge of the eatery told Wanbao that the restaurant strictly abides by hygiene regulations.

> He added that the employee who spotted the rat immediately informed his boss and threw away all the ingredients that were on the counter, including the roast ducks. The area was then cleaned and disinfected.

> He said that the eatery, which is open 24 hours a day, has its floors and utensils cleaned thrice a day.

> He also said the eatery engages a pest control company once a month.

> ""There are more than 10 mouse traps in every corner of this restaurant, and I have never once seen a rat here,"" he said.

> The restaurant's boss, 54-year-old Mr Lee, told Wanbao that staff are instructed to always keep food trays covered.

> However, he said that at the time that the video was taken, the ingredients in the trays were being refilled, which is why they were left uncovered.

> Mr Lee also pointed out that there is a rubbish collection point around 30 metres away from the restaurant, where rats sometimes emerge from at night.

> ""We definitely don't wish for these things to happen. All we can do is continue to take precautions,"" he said.

> As of 5pm yesterday, each of the 144 five-room flats in Bartley Beacon had more than six first-time applicants vying for the unit.

> Second-time applicants face an even bleaker prospect, with more than 152 applicants vying for each five-roomer.

> Prices for these flats, the largest flat types in the Bidadari estate project, range from $627,000 to $726,000, excluding grants.

> The last time new BTO flats were launched in the Bidadari estate, which is classified under the Toa Payoh town, was in May 2017.

> Then, prices for the five-room flats in a project named Woodleigh Hillside started from $579,000, excluding grants.

> In this month's sales exercise, which concluded at midnight, the 910 four-room flats in Bartley Beacon and ParkView @ Bidadari were less popular, attracting around three first-time applicants for each unit.

> BETTER CHANCE

> On the other hand, first-time applicants for the 184 three-room flats in both projects stood a better chance at securing a flat as it attracted just slightly more applicants than the available units.

> Also in demand were the four-room flats in Bishan Ridges, with close to five first-time applicants vying for each of the 1,222 four-room flats.

> These flats, within walking distance of Bishan MRT station, were the second most expensive units in this launch, with prices ranging from $528,000 to $679,000.

> Bigger flats in the non-mature estate of Sembawang were also hotly contested, with more than four first-time applicants vying for each of the 184 five-room flats in the housing project named Sun Sails.

> The odds were slightly better for the 238 four-room flats and 84 three-room flats, with around three first-time applicants for each available unit.

> In Tengah, the first Housing Board new town in over 20 years, there were almost three first-time applicants for each of the 327 five-room flats and around two applicants for each of the 570 four-room flats. These flats are spread across two housing projects named Garden Court @ Tengah and Garden Terrace @ Tengah, and will be the first to be completed around the first quarter of 2024.

Currently, the TDSR is set at 60%, i.e. the amount you need to pay back on all your loans combined must not exceed 60% of your salary.

Hdb buyers have to take note of the Mortgage servicing ratio, which is capped at 30%. 

What is Mortgage Servicing Ratio?

Mortgage Servicing Ratio, or MSR, is a limit imposed by the MAS on how much money you can borrow when you take out a loan to buy HDB property or an EC.

Under the MSR, a maximum of 30% of your gross monthly income can be used to repay your loan.

> SINGAPORE - An elderly man who allegedly killed his 79-year-old flatmate appeared in court on Monday (Sept 2) via videolink from Central Police Division.

> Pak Kian Huat, alias Pek Kiah Huat, 82, was charged with murdering Madam Lim Soi Moy in a Housing Board flat on the 21st storey of Block 191 Lorong 4 Toa Payoh.

> Police had received a call about the case at around 3.40am on Sunday and officers found Madam Lim motionless in the unit.

> She was later pronounced dead by paramedics.

> Neighbours told The Straits Times that Pak and Madam Lim were not married to each other but had lived in the same flat for more than 20 years.

> They described Madam Lim as a friendly person who looked younger than her age, and said they had never heard any arguments or quarrels coming from the unit.

> Retiree Goh Leng Sim, who lives below their unit, said Madam Lim worked at a McDonald's outlet at Safra Toa Payoh and had two sons and two daughters.

> Although they rarely spoke, the 86-year-old said she had bumped into Madam Lim when the latter was going out to exercise in the morning.

> ST visited the McDonald's outlet and confirmed that Madam Lim had worked there from 2013, but resigned a few months ago.

> A former colleague, who declined to be named, said the staff called Madam Lim ‚ÄúAh Ma‚Äù and were very fond of her, adding: ‚ÄúShe always treated the younger ones like her own grandchildren.

> Chinese-language daily Lianhe Wanbao reported that police officers had cordoned off the flat on Sunday morning and were seen gathering evidence from inside the unit, including personal items such as a pillow and pillowcase.

> Blood-stained footprints were also seen on the floor inside the unit and there were drops of blood on the ground outside it as well. Two men were seen entering the flat but they declined to speak to reporters.

> Pak's case has been adjourned to Sept 9.

> Offenders convicted of murder will face the death penalty.

> Residents of Block 55, Toa Payoh Lorong 5 are [spooked by the &apos;irregular behaviour&apos; of an elderly couple living in a rental flat on the 10th floor.](http://stomp.straitstimes.com/singapore-seen/irregular-behaviour-by-toa-payoh-couple-sparks-fears-among-residents)

> The woman was seen hurling burning items over the parapet and splashing a seemingly corrosive liquid outside her home, causing many residents to be concerned about their safety, The Straits Times reported.

> The metal gates and a stretch of the corridor outside the couple&apos;s unit were corroded, exposing bricks, metal pipes, and a pitted floor.

> The bizarre incidents surrounding the couple have been going on for over two years, a next-door neighbour said.

> Some days, she would find ashes and salt on her front door and windows, or her laundry on the corridor covered in oil.

> A 40-year-old housewife, who asked to remain anonymous, said that she has been hearing the woman shouting loudly every morning at around 7am for the past two months.

> She said: ""I can&apos;t make out what she says. So I just assume that she&apos;s just mentally unsound and left it at that.""

> According to the housewife, two officers had visited her unit last Friday (Jan 5).

> ""A policewoman asked me if I&apos;ve had any problems with my neighbours, and I said no. She later showed me some pictures of the corridor outside the woman&apos;s flat and said that some neighbours complained of her splashing things there.

> ""I took a look and was shocked. It looked as though somebody had splashed corrosive liquid there.""

> When she and her husband went up to the 10th floor to take a look at the elderly couple&apos;s flat, they were shocked.

> She said: ""The area outside the woman&apos;s flat was a mess. There was a strong chemical smell in the air and we felt a stinging sensation in our eyes. We quickly left the area after that.""

> Another neighbour who declined to be named said he saw the woman throwing burning items over the parapet, and added: ""I fear for my safety and that of the children living in this block.""

> Lianhe Wanbao reporters later visited the couple&apos;s unit and spoke to the woman, who claimed that her next-door neighbour had been intentionally pouring faeces and urine at her unit for the past two to three years.

> Thus, she had to scrub and wash the place with salt water every day.

> She also alleged that they would use a hammer to hit her metal gates and the wall outside her unit.

> However, the alleged neighbour, Mr Ye, 80, denied the claims and said that the elderly woman&apos;s multiple scrubbing sessions each day have corroded the corridor walls and her metal gates.

> He added that he did not dare to open his windows or door, and called the police over 30 times in past seven years to report his neighbours&apos; weird behaviour.

> Mr Ye, who had a stroke, said he was afraid that he might slip and fall as the corridor was constantly wet from the woman&apos;s washing.

> In response to media queries, the Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council said that the resident does not pose any danger to herself or others. It is also working with various agencies to help resolve the matter.

> In a statement issued on Saturday, town council chairman Chong Kee Hiong said that grassroots leaders who visited the elderly woman&apos;s flat discovered that she had used salt, vinegar, and baking powder to scrub the wall and floor repeatedly to &apos;get rid of spirits&apos;. She would also throw cold ash over the parapet.

> The agencies said they are aware of her actions and have been offering help to the woman over the past few months.

> Mr Chong, however, said that the woman has &apos;adamantly refused offers of help&apos; despite the agencies repeated attempts.

> He said: ""The police are monitoring if there are adequate grounds to compel her to seek professional help, but their current assessment is that she poses no danger to herself or residents.""

> Although repair works were carried out, the woman continued washing the corridors.

> The agencies involved also noted that the couple had been staying in the unit for over 10 years and relocating them would not solve the underlying problem.

> Mr Chong said: ""It would be unfair to the woman&apos;s husband to simply transfer the problem to another precinct and this may exacerbate her condition.""

> However, alternative housing arrangements are being considered, especially if her behaviour¬†does not¬†improve after receiving treatment.

> The agencies also emphasized that they would take the safety of all residents into account when dealing with the issue and expressed hope that the situation would reach a satisfactory outcome.

980,12,f2ke7hh,t1_f2kcyo2,"Ive tried but most of the tutorial in youtube use this device to rotate the tuner quickly. I rotate manually and the strings wont coil properly and it gets really messy. Im not sure if i should manually tighten the string or not, or if i bought the wrong string. I found out tht my guitar is classical guitar and the string i bought is for acoustic guitar. I also do not know if this matters or not.

I finished changing the strings (very messy tho) and the sound from the strings always echo unlike the previous strings. I dont know if it is the sound it supposed to make or if i fucked up.

983,12,f2ki4ey,t1_f2ke7hh,"First things first: Get the right strings. Acoustic on a classical is a no no. sounds bad (prob what you are hearing) more tension = gonna warp / break your neck. 

Second: yes, you can manually string a guitar without that tool (i think I know which vid you talking about, and I don‚Äôt even own one of those). 

You can also cut the excess of the string (AFTER you string it up and wind it so that the string is tight on the post) to keep it neat, and so you don‚Äôt need to wind it all the way. 

But lastly you need to learn how to do this yourself. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for you to go down to a shop to change strings every time you want to restring. Yeah you might fuck it up a few times (I fucked up multiple times in the 20 years I‚Äôve been playing), but that‚Äôs part of the learning. 

[a quick Google fetched this](https://youtu.be/AKsVF72Tsdg), which looks quite easy to follow. 

Good luck!",t3_ddndxm,05-10-2019
984,12,f2m7zj3,t1_f2ke7hh,"Winding device is definitely not necessary though. I like to treat winding devices and such as a luxury while practicing without special tools. Who knows when you might need to replace a set of strings without tools on hand.

Next time when you change strings, don't remove all the old strings immediately, leave at least one on as a reference in case you need it.

That said, acoustic metals strings on a classical is definitely a tough fit. Iirc classical guitar strings are tied at the bridge, while acoustic guitar metal strings are fit with pegs. Tying metal strings is not really a good idea because metal weakens when it's folded and might snap. Nylon strings won't have a problem with being tied.

I still believe you should string your guitar yourself. Buy the correct classical guitar strings and make another attempt before you give up. There's no better time to learn than the first. Took me more than an hour.",t3_ddndxm,05-10-2019

> It's been quite some time since the start of Phase 2 as the government eased restrictions to allow more social activities in Singapore.

> However, it seems as if people are getting accustomed to the situation as more crowds form in public spaces.

> Large weekend crowd at Toa Payoh Town Park

> Over the weekend, a large crowd was spotted at Toa Payoh Town Park on Aug. 16.

> According to Chinese newspaper Shin Min Daily News, there were hundreds of domestic workers gathering at the park.

> At 2pm on Aug. 16, the reporter observed around 30 groups of people.

> While the groups are kept to five people, there was sharing of food between groups and mingling between groups.

> One member of the public spotted a group of 12 domestic workers and went to remind them to abide with the safe distancing rules that day.

> A Filipino domestic helper told the reporter that she was there with six other friends to celebrate a birthday.

> As they are aware of the safe distancing rules, they split themselves into two groups and sat separately.

> She said that she does not understand why they have to be ""targeted"" and they ended up moving to another part of the park.

> Concerns over potential Covid-19 spread

> A chef working in the nearby restaurant said that there is an increasing number of people gathering in the area over the last two weeks.

> It was concerning to him to see some of them not wearing face masks while singing and chatting.

> He had reminded these park goers to abide by the rules and reported the situation to the authorities.

> Several staff at the restaurant also expressed their worries about the risks of Covid-19 spread.

> They are also afraid about how the businesses in the vicinity will be affected if the park is being listed as one of the places that has been visited by infectious Covid-19 patients.

> NParks urges all park users to be socially responsible

> In response to Mothership's query, the Group Director of Parks, National Park Board (NParks), Sophianne Araib said that the NParks officers are patrolling regularly at all gardens, parks, nature reserves as part of their daily work. This includes Toa Payoh Town Park.

> During their patrols, the park users are reminded to maintain a safe distance and keep their face masks on unless they are drinking water or doing strenuous exercises.

> NParks noted that most users abide by the safe distancing rules well and are cooperative when reminded to do so.

> On top of patrolling, the agency also uses drone and visitor count system to monitor the crowd levels at various green spaces.

> NParks urged members of the public to check the crowd levels via their online real time map before heading down to the parks.

> Totally unrelated but follow and listen to our podcast here
