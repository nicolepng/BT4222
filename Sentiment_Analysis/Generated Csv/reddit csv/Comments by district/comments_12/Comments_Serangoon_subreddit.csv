213,12,f8lpeoj,t3_e0zds4,"As u/Darth_Mail mentioned, this is a [Blue-winged Pitta](https://singaporebirds.com/species/blue-winged-pitta/) - this species is migratory, and is regularly recorded in various locations all over Singapore, including urban greenery. Sadly, the Blue-winged Pitta appears to be [prone to collisions with windows](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/skyscrapers-pose-fatal-risk-to-migratory-birds); quite a few records every year involve members of the public stumbling upon pittas, both dead and alive, that [crashed into buildings](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319057472_Migratory_bird_collisions_with_man-made_structures_in_South-east_Asia_a_case_study_from_Singapore). Hopefully this one wasn't injured, and managed to continue its journey.

There has been at least one report of Blue-winged Pitta [breeding here](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2017/03/18/first-nesting-record-of-the-blue-winged-pitta-in-singapore/), so there might be a small population that stays in Singapore throughout the year.

The [Fairy Pitta](https://singaporebirds.com/species/fairy-pitta/) is a close relative of the Blue-winged Pitta, and does bear some resemblance, but there are differences in the plumage. There has been only a single record of this species in Singapore, when one was seen in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve for several days earlier in November this year. This species usually migrates from temperate East Asia to Borneo, so this individual must have wandered off course.",t3_e0zds4,24-11-2019

One of the photographers who first saw the Fairy Pitta that was in Singapore earlier this month just happened to see a pitta hopping around in poor lighting along the forest trail, decided to take a few photos, and only confirmed he had found a species never recorded before in Singapore while he was reviewing his shots some time later.",t3_e0zds4,25-11-2019

I haven‚Äôt managed to thank everyone individually but I really appreciate your offers. I could be an internet scam for all you know but I am very touched by the trust in the community.

I reached at 12am the yesterday, just nice when the social workers reached as well. Was thinking of the worst that I wouldn‚Äôt see the lady but she was there. Somehow she recognised me even though it was a passing interaction. She told me that she was waiting for me at the taxi stand for me today, hoping I would pass by again - she couldn‚Äôt get to my house from the address on my NRIC because of her leg condition. She was so excited and genuinely nice about it that I started to feel bad - it‚Äôs mixed emotions but all I can say is sometimes you want to believe that the world is fair and that good people don‚Äôt ever get into bad situations but I guess this is not one of the cases.¬†

The social workers told me they would try to access her case and evaluate the best next course of action. They did say they will try to get her home (although I wonder if she‚Äôs a rough sleeper, she most likely not have one?) but they were quite tight-lipped about it, I‚Äôm guessing for privacy issues. This whole incident did kind of leave me with a lot more questions though. The social worker that called me did mention that they had her case in her system so I‚Äôm wondering how she ended up back at this state if she previously seemed to have received help? Is this a choice? Especially, since she seemed to be in a perfectly sound state of mind to seek help, why hasn‚Äôt she? I honestly wish I had the time to speak to her more to understand her situation better, but my only hope is that the social workers are able to help her get the help that she needs.¬†

UPDATE 2: The social worker called and told me that the lady got medical attention for her legs after they visited her yesterday. She‚Äôs in the hospital now. The social worker mentioned the lady does actually have a house - she lives with her son but they are apparently not in good terms which is why she choses to be outside instead. The social worker said that she should be assigned someone to her case after her discharge from the hospital to negotiate relations between her son and her and hopefully get her to be okay staying home. She told me to look out for the her in case she goes back to loitering around NEX, since she wasn‚Äôt very open to receiving help the last time. It does seem that she is getting help now so here‚Äôs an update for anyone who is concerned for her:)

PSA: for anyone who have seen recurring rough sleepers around your neighbourhood, one way you can help is by calling ComCare at this number:¬†1800-2220000

Their hotline runs from 7AM-12 midnight daily so it‚Äôs pretty easy to reach them. They will ask you a couple of questions to identify the person, if you are able to take a photo of the person, it would be best and get any contact information from them, like their name and number. Hopefully, this helps anyone who isn‚Äôt sure about how to help homeless people they‚Äôve seen around, the whole process was very convenient and efficient, they went down to find her on the day I called them",t3_jhoyo8,26-10-2020

* Food store on 4th floor near the lift: super good xin zhou mi fen

One person can work the ground perhaps, another with great town council management skills, one with financial expertise etc. I much prefer it over having to entrust an area to a single individual who isn‚Äôt well rounded enough.

We are land-poor but talent rich. Why not have a different system of representation compared to other countries? We set up every aspect of our society to maximize our advantages and minimize our weaknesses. Why not governance and representation as well?",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
454,12,fkjf7h2,t1_fkjdxdf,"They're both sides of the same coin, inho. And while it does sound good on paper, the current practice is for MPs to be allocated certain neighbourhoods/precincts that they're in charge of, which is not much different from that of running a SMC. It is also quite hard for MPs to cover overlapping areas to ensure well-rounded support for the people, as a single neighbourhood alone consists of multiple families, let alone trying to canvas multiple neighbourhoods at once.

There's also the thorny issue of GRCs being used to ""parachute"" (allegedly) otherwise unelectable newcomers into parliament. Take Dr Koh Poh Koon, for instance. Despite being hailed as the son of Punggol, he did not run again for Punggol East SMC in GE2015. Rather, he campaigned under the AMK GRC team instead, where it was arguably easier to gain admittance into Parliament as compared to campaigning alone in a SMC.

It is therefore my opinion that the concept of GRCs should be relooked at and perhaps amended to be more democratic.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
455,12,fkjhrij,t1_fkjf7h2,"Funny how I look at those aspects as positives rather than negatives. Being able to divide and coalesce responsibilities where appropriate - that‚Äôs the strength of group representation. Obviously some tasks are better tackled individually, and some tasks are better tackled collectively. That‚Äôs efficiency and we‚Äôre bloody efficient if nothing else.

The GRC system being able to bring in high potential but low experience representatives is also a fantastic strength. That‚Äôs how we groom young executives in large corporations - bring them into a team to work on big projects they otherwise could never get exposure to on their own, get them to learn from experienced mentors, and eventually fulfill their potential. It‚Äôs a fantastic system, compared to young hopefuls being thrust into SMCs with no experience or guidance. Again, it‚Äôs efficient, proven and similar to methods employed by tons of extremely successful organizations.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
456,12,fkjj7sp,t1_fkjhrij,"And herein lies the rub. The system benefits incumbents greatly, while simultaneously raising the bar for any team willing to mount a challenge. No offense, but the way you're looking at it reminds me of the mindset of a business executive. Sure, what you're proposing is great from an organisational standpoint, but from a democratic point of view, it is deeply flawed. If we're truly about electing the best team for the job, why is there a huge divide in requirements for both sides? Sure, one could argue that the incoming party would have to prove themselves first and that some measure of safeguards have to be in place. But the current playing field is so skewed that it might as well be a one-sided game of chess.

> Here's a General Election story that will definitely warm the cockles of your heart.

> One of a kind polling day for nursing home residents

> Ling Kwang Home is a nursing home located at Serangoon Garden Way.

> The nursing home takes care of 300 frail aged residents who are mostly wheelchair or bed bound and are highly-dependent on nursing care.

> As a result of old age and illness, some elderly residents staying at Ling Kwang Home are unable to vote.

> However, to include them in this crucial national event that they used to participate, the caretakers have created their very own polling day.

> Instead of a slate of political parties to choose from, the residents are given two choices of drinks to vote: 3-in-1 coffee or tea.

> The residents have to indicate their choice with an ""X"" on their ballot paper.

> Big win for 3-in-1 coffee

> And the drink that received a strong mandate was coffee with an overwhelming vote of 92.1 per cent.

> Only 4.68 per cent of the residents voted for tea. Fret not, no election deposit money was lost.

> Two voters spoiled their votes, including one who drew ""O"" instead of ""X"".

> Resident Annie Teo did not like the two choices and nothing is stopping her from getting a nice cup of Milo as a dissenter.At the end, everyone still got their drinks, thanks to these caring staff.

> Around 90 per cent of the residents are referred to the home by the Agency for Integrated Care and are eligible for government subsidy.

> However, there are some who are unable to pay for their stay at the nursing home.

> For those who are unable to pay, the home relies on donations to cover the deficit in caring for them.

> You can donate to them via Giving.sg.

The chip is generally around the size of a rice grain at the back of the dog's neck.

> This woman really wants her car washed, and does not plan on letting a couple of storeys -- or ten storeys in this case -- get in her way.

> Stomper Kenneth told Stomp that he spotted a resident use an extremely long water pipe to wash her car at Block 506 Serangoon North Avenue 4 on September 6 at 3.25pm.

> He also sent photos of what he saw.

> In the photos, the pipe seems to be connected to a water outlet on the 10th floor and is being used to wash a car on the ground floor.

> ""This is not the first time I saw this happen. They were washing their car on August 30 too,"" Kenneth said.

> ""My neighbour is also unhappy with the way they have been using the water.

> ""It is really a waste of water and it may even be dangerous for residents if the water pipe is not being managed well.

> ""You can just pay $1 to use a spray gun to wash your car at the nearby multi-storey carpark, so why do they need to do this?""

> Stomp has contacted Ang Mo Kio Town Council for more information.

> U.S. burger chain Five Guys is opening its second outlet in the heartlands, at Nex shopping centre in Serangoon.

> North-easties can expect the outlet in early 2021.

> Similar to the Plaza Singapura outlet, it will offer dine-in, takeaway, and delivery options.

> The brand is known for their customisable burgers with unlimited toppings.

> Prices start from S$11 for a ""little"" burger, and go up to S$17 for a bacon-cheeseburger.

> Hotdogs, milkshakes, and fries are also on the menu.

> Five Guys, which is brought in by the Zouk Group, arrived to staggering queues in December 2019.

> Nex has been acquiring some exciting new tenants lately, such as Beauty in The Pot and homegrown bubble tea brand Fruce.

> Totally unrelated but follow and listen to our podcast here:

From what I found, it seems Pulau Ubin (and other surrounding islands) were ceded to the East India company as part of the [1824 Treaty of Friendship and Alliance](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2015-07-23_153326.html).

>Under the terms of the 1824 treaty, Singapore and its surrounding islands were ceded to the EIC.

In the article about [Pulau Ubin](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_219_2004-12-13.html), it is mentioned

>In 1825, exactly one year after Singapore was ceded to the British,¬†John Crawfurd,  the Resident, made an expedition around Pulau Ubin, or Pulo Obin as it  was spelt then,¬†to take formal possession of it. Crawfurd‚Äôs party landed  on the island on 4 August 1825, hoisted the British flag and fired a  21-gun salute. The island‚Äôs occupants then were a few woodcutters living  in huts.

Additionally from  [John Crawfurd](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_188_2005-01-20.html)

>The treaty ceded to the EIC all rights to Singapore and the islands within 10 geographical miles of its shores.

Seems like the territories comprising ""Singapore"" were decided by the British at that time. Successive administrations, whether in Malaysia/Singapore, may have just followed the existing definitions.

As to why exactly the British included Pulau Ubin and other islands, I am not sure. I can only speculate that they wanted to keep a few buffer islands to themselves.",t3_lhhqfo,11-02-2021

> SINGAPORE: Three cases of locally transmitted Zika infection have been confirmed in the Serangoon Gardens area, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) on Friday (Sep 13), making this Singapore's first Zika cluster of the year.

> All three are residents at Hemsley Avenue.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""Residents and stakeholders are urged to maintain vigilance and continue to eliminate mosquito breeding habitats, as there could still be asymptomatic or mild, undiagnosed cases which might result in further transmission of the virus if there are mosquitoes in the vicinity,"" said NEA.

> 

> The Zika cluster is close to an eight-case dengue cluster at Bridport Avenue/Cowdray Avenue/Huddington Avenue/Portchester Avenue/Tavistock Avenue, which was notified on Aug 20, said NEA.

> 

> Five mosquito breeding habitats in the dengue cluster have since been destroyed, the agency added.

> There have been a total of 10 Zika cases in Singapore this year, according to NEA's website.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Singapore reported its very first imported case of Zika in May 2016, and the first locally transmitted case came a few months later in August. By the end of that year, more than 450 people had been infected.

> In 2017, there were 67 confirmed cases of Zika, of which three were imported. One case of Zika was reported in 2018, according to data from the Ministry of Health.

> The virus has been associated with neurological diseases such as microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with a smaller head due to abnormalities in the development of the brain.

> Both Zika and dengue are spread by the aedes aegypti mosquito.

> 

> There's been a surge in dengue cases this year, with nine deaths and 11,490 cases.

> NEA urged residents to continue to prevent mosquito breeding habitats.

> ""Residents are requested to allow NEA officers to carry out inspections and indoor spraying of their homes,"" said the agency.

> 

> ""With the presence of the Aedes mosquito vector here, everyone must continue to maintain vigilance and play his part to prevent future localised transmission through eradicating mosquito breeding habitats in the neighbourhoods.""

> 

> NEA added that people are advised to seek medical attention if they are unwell, especially with symptoms such as fever and rash. They should also inform their doctors of the location where they live and work.
