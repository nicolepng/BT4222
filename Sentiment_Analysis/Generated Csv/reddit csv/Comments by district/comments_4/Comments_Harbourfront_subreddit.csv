The only thing it's useful for are things like aerosol cans, which can burst at altitude. That's not a worry with MRT.

> SINGAPORE - MRT commuters at Harbourfront station may undergo security screening, including metal detector checks and have their belonging scanned by X-ray machines, on Aug 2.

> In their statement on Wednesday (July 17), SMRT, SBS Transit and the Land Transport Authority said the security screening is part of a joint exercise titled Exercise Station Guard and will take place between 10am and 4pm.

> During the exercise, commuters entering the station will be directed towards fare gates near exits A,B,C and D for the screening while commuters exiting the station will be directed to the fare gate cluster near exit E, towards Vivocity.

> Apart from a walk-through metal detector and X-ray machines, mass screening devices that can detect explosives and firearms in bags or under a person's clothing will also be used.

> Exercise Station Guard is part of the national SGSecure movement to strengthen security in public places and build community resilience against security threats.

> The exercise has been conducted since February 2018 to test and validate security measures, contingency plans and operational readiness at public transport nodes during heightened security situations.

> Similar exercises were conducted at Jurong East, Newton, Holland Village and Hougang stations in the past.

> Related Story LTA begins trial of enhanced security checks at MRT stations

> ""Beyond ensuring operational readiness, Exercise Station Guard also serves to raise public awareness of the security threats which Singapore faces and familiarise public transport commuters with what to do during an emergency situation,"" the statement said.

> Commuters are advised to factor in additional time in their travel schedule for the security screening.

141,3,ejn8vei,t3_b6v3f7,"I was puzzling over why they didn't go after the caregiver for cat hoarding and allowing them to roam. Turns out that most of them belong to her irresponsible neighbours who pretty much abandoned them and she was too kind to let them be so she looked after them too (but obviously you can't keep 15 cats in a flat).

Meanwhile, the Town Council has not only established themselves as cat killers but also serial liars. How stupid can they be to have so many major ""miscommunication issues""?

I'd like to see the Town Council investigated for animal cruelty and mishandling, and those irresponsible cat owners for pet abandonment. Unfortunately I suspect that they will all get away scot-free at the expense of a heart-broken woman and innocent cat and this makes me really upset.

&#x200B;

On a side note, if you have cats, please don't let them roam. If you play with/feed your community cats, please don't encourage them to go to the higher floors. I hear my friends talk about how their neighbours' cats or the community cats enter their houses or take the lift. It's amusing if you like cats, but this is the sort of problem that incurs the wrath of those who don't like animals/cats and that's how all the complaints against community cats start. And unfortunately, in SG, when it comes to animal affairs, the noisiest, angriest people get their say :(",t3_b6v3f7,29-03-2019
142,3,ejnbokc,t3_b6v3f7,"Eh to me the woman is in the wrong. I’m a cat person myself and letting them roam is inexcusable in this modern age. People like her set back the cat ownership policy change that should be happening. 

These are not house cats if they roam freely. For the sake of your cats and your neighbors, do keep your pets indoors. ",t3_b6v3f7,29-03-2019

145,3,ejneccg,t1_ejnbokc,"The impression I got is that they are community cats and she is the caregiver/feeder, not the owner. Some community cats are used to roaming and find it hard to adjust to indoor life, so it's hard to rehome them.

If what the other commenter said is correct, then those cats were abandoned by others living in the area. In that case, the penalty for abandoning cats should be made stiffer or enforced. (But if cats can't even be legally kept in HDB flats, can we even enforce laws against the abandonment of cats.....? 🤔)",t3_b6v3f7,29-03-2019

149,3,ejnfaoq,t1_ejnf0cv,"That's a valid point. Just want to add that if her cats were originally strays/feral then it might be hard to confine them in the house (from personal experience). I don't think she's in the wrong here though, the Town Council has no right to handle relocating stray animals/cats without consulting AVA or CWS first on the potential consequences.",t3_b6v3f7,29-03-2019

151,3,ejnfklj,t1_ejnffst,"Yes, it doesn't contravene a specific law but that doesn't make it a right move (or at least, not a wrong move).

They should have consulted an authority on the matter.",t3_b6v3f7,29-03-2019
