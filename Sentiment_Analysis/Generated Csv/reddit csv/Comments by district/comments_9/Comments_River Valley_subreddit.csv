> A 999-year leasehold condominium in Singapore on Kellock Road in prime District 10 has sold for S$3.2 million -- more than double its original purchase price.

> According to EdgeProp, the 1,464 sq ft unit, one of 170 in Melrose Park, turned a profit of S$1.83 million.

> The 18-year-old three-bedroom unit was purchased for S$1.37 million (S$936 psf) in May 2002.

> Its selling price of S$2,186 psf is more than double the original price.

> The seller made a 134 per cent profit on the sale, which comes up to an annualised profit of 4.7 per cent over 18½ years.

> The Melrose Park development was completed in 2000.

> It is situated in River Valley and is beside Great World City and near the upcoming Great World MRT Station on the Thomson-East Coast Line.

> The residential development comprises three- and four-bedroom units ranging from 1,292 sq ft to 3,800 sq ft.

> Properties with 999-year leasehold are assumed to be freehold and generally fetch a premium price.

> Singapore no longer has new 999-year leases.

Basically it’s hard to trace food poisoning. Hawkers cook in small batches. It’s easier to detect food poisoning when a large group of people are affected. This is why caterers, canteen operators etc are typically caught more frequently.

> A few anecdotes have surfaced about Singapore's home-based learning (HBL) curriculum.

> While some may complain that the HBL setting bears little to no resemblance to a physical classroom, students at River Valley High have kept to a daily school routine — pledge-taking.

> Every morning, before HBL starts, the students don their school t-shirts before reciting the pledge as a class.

> The process is led by a classmate, and takes place over a video conferencing tool.

> It is then followed by temperature-taking.

> This was revealed by minister for education Ong Ye Kung in a Facebook post on Apr. 16.

> Ong explained that the school wanted students to continue these practices during HBL, as part of their social and learning experience.

> While it may seem unnecessary to some, Ong continued, the routine instils a sense of discipline in the students, and marks the start of their school day despite being at home.

> You can read his post in full here.
