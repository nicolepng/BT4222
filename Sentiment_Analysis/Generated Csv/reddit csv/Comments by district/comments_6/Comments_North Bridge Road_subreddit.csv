That stretch of North Bridge Road was full of watch shops then; many of them moved later to Bras Basah Complex, The Bencoolen & Peninsula Plaza. Correspondingly, Victoria Street was full of furniture shops. A few (like my relatives) moved later to Funan but the majority all shifted to the HDB heartlands.

> The tree in question was last inspected by an arborist in December along with others in the estate, and the next inspection is scheduled in June, according to the post.

> ""The town council would like to assure residents that it has in place an active horticulture maintenance programme,"" the Facebook post added.

> It said that under this programme, trees in the town are inspected by an arborist every six months and ""major pruning is carried out where necessary"". In addition, ""general maintenance"" is also carried out once a month.
