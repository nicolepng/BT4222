*Still, most scientists and regulatory agencies agree that even small doses of gamma and x-radiation increase cancer risk, although by a very small amount. In general, the risk of cancer from radiation exposure increases as the dose of radiation increases. Likewise, the lower the exposure is, the smaller the increase in risk. But there is no threshold below which this kind of radiation is thought to be totally safe.*

In all the cities (interesting to note they are developed democracies, including Asian cities) I've been to that have suffered from actual terrorist attacks on their transport system, none have adopted the measures Singapore has in the aftermath: daily nonstop screenings of bomb blasts (that did not happen in Singapore), constant speaker announcements that commuters have to watch out for unattended baggage, and now this. This system itself doesn't reflect commitment as can be seen from how only selected baggage are screened, so it is up to the imagination as to why SMRT has chosen to adopt such drastic - and ineffective - measures. Off the top of my head, I understand that say London would press on with daily life so as to demonstrate they are not succumbing to the aim of terrorism: to instil fear in daily life. Given that London subsequently suffered from numerous terrorist attacks in different forms,  id say they would have done research to understand how best to prevent such efforts and yet they still did not choose such dramatic efforts like ours. I'd change my mind if there's research though.
