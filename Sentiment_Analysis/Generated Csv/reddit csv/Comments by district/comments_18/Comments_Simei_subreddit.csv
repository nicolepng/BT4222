If you look at the spacing between the clouds, it's actually the wavelength of the condensation for these homonculous clouds, aka wave clouds.

This is formed when air is moving through the atmosphere like an ocean wave, the lowest parts of the air condenses into clouds and the highest parts are ""empty spaces"". It is an atmospheric scale sine wave made of clouds.",t3_c44n4v,23-06-2019

> A beloved pet going missing is always tough on owners, some of whom often spend much time and cash in search of the animal.

> In a rather epic story shared over several Facebook posts by one Raine Lim, one long-lost pet miraculously appeared three years later — and over 30km from its original home.

> New cat on the block

> Lim first posted on Feb. 3 about a new cat she had seen around Blk 146 Simei Street 2.

> The cat appeared to be in bad shape, appearing tired and grubby.

> It's paws were streaked with mud and dirt, and Lim added that its claws were long and overgrown.

> It also had cloudy eyes.

> A short clip of the kitty showed how thin its body was.

> Lim wondered if the cat was a long-lost pet.

> Although she had contacted SPCA asking if they could take the cat in, SPCA apparently denied her request as the cat did not require immediate medical attention.

> In the meantime, Lim said she would feed and clean the cat up, and monitor its condition.

> A long-lost pet?

> On Feb. 4, Lim posted a second ""big update"".

> Lim's speculations that the cat was a lost pet turned out to be true.

> She said that a woman had approached her claiming that the injured kitty at Simei looked exactly like her missing pet cat, Manis.

> Amazingly, Manis first disappeared from its home in Jurong West in 2018.

> Which leads to the conclusion that the small cat had possibly trekked from all the way from the west to the east over three years.

> Here are some old photos of what Manis looks like.

> Pretty similar to the cat in Simei.

> Lim added that she was ""90 per cent certain it's the same cat"".

> Reunited

> The woman subsequently went down to Simei to verify if it was really her missing cat. Thankfully, the cat was the real deal.

> Manis was finally reunited with its family after three long years.

> Manis' owners told Lim that they first picked him up as a kitten at Toa Payoh.

> When their house at Jurong West was undergoing renovation in 2018, Manis somehow escaped.

> In a third post, Lim expressed her happiness that Manis had finally been returned to his owners, and urged those with missing pets not to lose hope.

> ""He is finally reunited with his family after three years!! This is honestly so so unbelievable, but I am truly so so happy that he is back with his family. Don’t know how he travelled from Jurong West all the way to Simei! But this is truly a miracle!! To everyone that has a missing furbaby, don’t give up hope! There is a possibility that they are still out there, don’t stop posting about them, don’t stop looking for them. I hope one day all the missing pets will be reunited with their families, just like Manis did.""

And this was during a time when reusable masks were not readily available in the market and global supply of surgical masks and N95 masks was at a shortage worldwide with countries imposing a export ban. What will happen is a stress on our stockpile of surgical and N95 masks which means less equipment for our medical staff and frontliners (who put themselves at higher risks than the general public) to work with.

203,18,fohw0mq,t1_fogvwty,"Healthcare workers use both surgical masks and N95s.  And people do not just buy from Valu$ or Watson's.

Firstly, in the situation of a pandemic, when told there is a shortage of a certain item, there will always be those who rush out to grab and hoard the ""best"" items.  (Meaning there would and have been people who ran out to look for N95s (even medical N95s) and ASTM Level 3 surgical masks, and had the financial means to buy and hoard these higher tiers of masks.  And people who buy up this tier of masks tend to have the financial capacity to buy these masks in very large quantities.  This has been happening worldwide once people realized that masks are effective against the virus.)

Secondly, in the situation of a pandemic + local and global mask shortages, lower-grade masks become a substitute for top-tier medical N95s (just look at what has been happening in other countries, where shortages of the top grade n95s caused healthcare workers to reach further and further down the tiers of masks for substitutes, until places like the USA are in a situation where healthcare workers are using homemade cotton masks and t-shirts on the frontline).

Basically, in the scenario of a pandemic and global shortages, there becomes much less (almost zero) *market distinction* between masks ""for healthcare workers"" and masks ""not for healthcare workers"" - everyone is trying to get a mask, any mask, and those who can afford to or in the position to will want to get the best mask possible.  This is despite any explicit government messaging that pleads with people to conserve masks, or to conserve a certain type of mask.  You will still get at least a few bad players who hoard masks. (For example, look at the cases of people in Europe and the US who bought up thousands, sometimes tens of thousands, of N95s.  As individuals.  For the purpose of reselling later.  Or some healthcare workers even, from Japan to the US, who basically stole mask supplies from their own medical institutions to hoard/distribute/sell for their own personal purposes.)  And it only takes a few bad players to ruin the situation or exacerbate the shortage for everyone involved.  (Much like the concept of this CB and social distancing.)",t3_g766py,25-04-2020
204,18,foibt7a,t1_foi0uab,"Initially what we already knew is that masks do not prevent people who are well from getting sick. It helps by blocking infected droplets from a sick person. This is why health authorities like WHO advised not to wear masks initially.

After some time, as the virus continued to spread, there were more studies and research suggesting that maybe there might be asymptomatic transmission occuring. This means that a person might be well but still be infected spreading it to others. This is why the CDC and WHO changed the advisory on masks which Singapore followed.  

And one might say the government should always be ready for this kind of situation by having enough stockpile to meet demand. Surgical mask and N95 masks have an expiry date (1 to 3 years for surgical mask and 5 years for N95). Mathematically speaking there will always be a maximum number to that stockpile during normal times because the old batch must be used by medical staff/scientists/etc before they expire while the new batch come in to prevent wastage.

# Symptoms of pneumonia, a middle-aged man sent to the hospital for observation in Simei

When a middle-aged man went to a clinic in Dongfufang next to Simei subway station yesterday morning, he developed symptoms related to pneumonia and was sent to Chen Dusheng Hospital for observation.

A Raffles Medical Group spokesperson responded to the Lianhe Zaobao inquiry and confirmed that the man had symptoms related to pneumonia when he went to his clinic. Medical staff took precautions and called an ambulance to take him to the hospital.

According to a video circulating on Facebook, five or six medical staff wearing masks, gloves and protective gowns and other equipment appeared in Dongfufang yesterday, two of them are pushing a patient into an ambulance.

Several netizens commented under the video, expressing concern that the man's condition was related to Wuhan pneumonia.

Our reporter visited Dongfufang at about 4 pm. Female employee Huang (27 years old) from a pet shop said in an interview that medical staff sent the man in the video to the hospital at about 10 am.

She described the man, who was about 50 years old, and was conscious when he was pushed into an ambulance. The corridor outside the mall was surrounded by a blockade, and medical staff were fully armed.

Ms. Huang described that after the patient was taken to the hospital, several cleaners wearing masks in the mall began to disinfect the corridor, and the blockade was not removed until completion at around 10.30 in the morning.

An unnamed cleaner said that she received instructions from the mall yesterday to disinfect the corridor. He said the mall had just held a drill a week ago to train employees on how to respond to similar incidents.",t3_et5q0w,24-01-2020

> SINGAPORE — The twin sisters who were caught on video causing a ruckus at Simei Green Condominium in 2015 had their appeal against conviction dismissed on Wednesday (July 3), but not before they put up an impassioned plea to the judge not to treat them differently because they are women from China.

> Speaking through a Mandarin interpreter, the older of the 51-year-old twins, Tang Bei, told the Supreme Court: “Doesn’t mean that just because I am weaker being a woman, and a woman from China, that I deserve to be hit.”

> Tang, who was self-represented, was arguing that one of their victims, condominium manager Colvin Quek Choon Kiat, had admitted to punching her in a “controlled” manner during the scuffle on April 28, 2015.

> But Mr Quek was not charged, whereas Tang and her sister Tang Lei — both Singapore permanent residents — were charged with voluntarily causing hurt and using criminal force on the condominium manager and his colleague, security guard Bligh Charles Kenneth.

> The attack erupted after a dispute over a condominium access card, which saw the twins spitting into Mr Quek’s face, while Tang Lei splashed the contents of a canned drink at him.

> Mr Kenneth tried to break up the confrontation, but the pair hit him on the right arm and shoulder.

> They were found guilty after a 21-day trial that spanned more than two years, and fined a total of S$4,600.

> On Wednesday, Tang Bei accused the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) of basing their charges on Mr Quek’s account, which was “completely taken out of context and not truthful”.

> The manager’s account can’t be believed as he had an intention to chase the twins out after a run-in with her two months ago, during which the man choked and molested her, she said.

> “After I was hit, molested and insulted for my nationality, I just reacted naturally as a normal human would. And in fact, Colvin Quek lifted his hands first. But in the prosecution’s eyes, it was a natural reaction by a normal person,” she added.

> A DISORDERLY HEARING THAT WENT OVERTIME

> These were points the sisters — who were taking turns to make submissions — belaboured throughout their hearing that went into overtime, taking up close to four hours although it was scheduled to take three hours at most.

> This was despite Justice Aedit Abdullah's repeated reminders to stick to their main arguments as he had already read their written submissions.

> But each time the judge interjected, the twins would insist that they needed to say two to three more sentences, then proceed to make a few more points.

> Justice Aedit was moved to cut them off abruptly on many instances. Once during the hearing, he ordered the duo to stand up as he rapped them for not listening to commands.

> When making submissions, Tang Bei also fixated her gaze on Deputy Public Prosecutors Bhajanvir Singh and Ho Lian-Yi who represented the AGC, prompting Justice Aedit to ask her twice: “Why are you facing them?”

> The DPPs avoided making eye contact with her throughout.

> At some points, the hearing turned emotional as well.

> Said Tang Bei with a raised voice: “Quek was the provoker… He threw the punch because he wanted the situation to deteriorate… When we chose to leave this dangerous place (the management’s office), he followed us out in hope that the situation would escalate.”

> She continued: “Quek gave false testimony. That clearly shows he is the real criminal. If not, he doesn’t need to. Is it because I am from China and a woman?”

> She earlier testified that Mr Quek had made discriminatory statements at her, including scolding her “F PRCs” in the April incident.

> WE ARE THE TRUE VICTIMS: TANG BEI

> Switching to speak in English, she cried as she said: “Your honour, I had lived in Singapore for over 20 years. I never had a criminal record. Now I was molested, choked, punched, but now I am in the criminal stand.

> “If this incident was told to international media and the rest of the world, it would be seen as a joke. And it would encourage other molesters to set traps (on their victims). Do I not have the basic right to react after I was molested and punched twice?

> “I have been innocent all my life, but because I didn’t choose to file a police report…”

> Justice Aedit stopped her from continuing, as she had made the point multiple times about how she was being “benevolent"" when she did not report Mr Quek’s alleged molest and choking in February 2015 to the police.

> When given yet another chance to speak, Tang Bei said: “We hope that your honour would treat us fairly… I believe that Singapore’s law will be fair to everyone, (whether) foreigner or foreigner woman. If the prosecutor and the police can ignore the provocations and actions (Quek) had committed, I believe you can set aside the charges we face.”

> She then volunteered her takeaway from the whole ordeal. “The lesson for me is that if I see a molester, I will no longer hesitate to report to the police.”

> Asked if she would want a lower sentence, Tang Lei said: “No matter what the sentence, it would be unfair.”

> Meanwhile, the prosecution argued that the appeal should consider the strength of the evidence adduced. “We have the footage. We have a report that Mr Quek did suffer injuries... In the face of overwhelming evidence, the charges were made out,” said DPP Singh.

> THE VERDICT

> Justice Aedit opened his verdict by stating that he had ""a clear impression of (the twins’) grievances” about how they were treated.

> Pointing out that there was considerable interest in the case partly because of their Chinese nationality, he said: “I would like to emphasise that the courts in Singapore will determine matters fairly and equally for all persons regardless of nationality, religion, or any (background) of that nature.

> “The court does not distinguish between people of different backgrounds. What the court needs to do is to consider the law and the evidence tendered.”

> Justice Aedit then said he is not persuaded that there was enough evidence to overturn what the trial judge had ruled, nor was there any valid area of law contested.

> As for Tang Bei’s defence that she was being provoked into action, the judge ruled that none of those were “grave and sudden” that could justify her reaction.

> Meanwhile, Judge Aedit said the perceptions of others involved in the case are “matters not before me”. “(They) would involve the prosecutors’ discretion,” he said.

> “All I can do is to determine if the charges were made out,” he added.

> Nevertheless, “I commend you for putting in the effort (to pursue the case)”, the judge said.
