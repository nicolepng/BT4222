This eco bridge over it, in my opinion, is like a cheap-ass plaster (*dont xkcd this imagery pls*) being used to cover a major gash in the forest.

The damage was already done, plus building the BKE sort of made it fair game to encroach deeper into nature for the sake of 'development'. Building bridges makes everyone develop a false feeling that Singapore is doing a lot to 'be green', when in reality we're cutting down the forest to build what is branded as '*a garden*', which is just a man-made facsimile of nature IMO. Look at Tengah. Look at Bayshore. Both are projects branded as eco-towns, but **tons** of forest are being cut down to develop these towns.

That fence is meant to deter Wild Boar and Sambar Deer, which occur in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. The concern is that if these large mammals were allowed to use the EcoLink, they might eat, trample, and dig up the young trees and other plants growing on it, damaging the attempt at creating a forest on the bridge and making it less attractive to other forest animals.

Also, the forest in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is seen as more sensitive, as it comprises larger areas of primary rainforest. Having high numbers of Wild Boar and Sambar Deer in there might cause serious damage to these tiny forest fragments, and threaten some of the more endangered plants and animals that need these habitats for survival.

I think the issue is that natural conservation is very broad, and it can be a difficult choice balancing multiple objectives. Two examples:

Going back to the construction of the road infrastructure, which has the effect of decreasing road congestion in the Singapore context. Decreasing congestion reduces fuel consumption and hence carbon footprint. How do we set a balance between emissions and local biodiversity?

The development of Singapore also draws immigrants from around the region from areas that are far less dense, potentially avoiding urban sprawl and biodiversity loss due to development there.

84,10,erv59b3,t1_erua0xy,"This might help give an idea what is going on. In March 1963, the Govt built and released 2 rental HDB blocks. They were first HDB flats in Singapore and it was in Duxton Plain. That same site is now  houses the Pinnacle released in 2009, 7 blocks that are 50 storeys high and have the highest sky gardens in the World. The original site was built up in the 19th centre. It is also in the city. It called urban renewal.

We also built fuel storage sites off Jurong 40 storey underground to keep the 3 big oil refiners within our economy. 4.5 times larger than this is SAF's ammunition dump deep underground.

In 1971, Singapore with the help of UN consultants and subsidised by the UN we had a our first land use concept plan which is a long term plan. It ring fenced our central catchment area - our green lung and our forest reserve. Its remains true today with the last concept plan in 2011 still holding on to this very principle.

Laws have been changed, codes are more specific and when Kampung Bugis is developed in the city precinct, it will house not only people but plants and greenery that will so thick that it will stand out and not the buildings.

At independence, our land area stood at 578 sg km and it has grown to 719 sq km, a whopping 25% increase. We built the entire Marine Parade Estate plus a host of East Coast condominiums on reclaimed land and we did not touch our forest. Much of the green areas that went into more homes were actually secondary forest or belukar. It was overgrown with weeds and plants from abandoned kampungs and farms and smallholdings as residents were rehoused into HDB flats.

The URA is actually called Urban **Redevelopment** Authority with the emphasis on ""**redevelopment**"". It is now over 40 years old and even then the idea was not to touch the primary forest.

Golden Shoe will give up its Financial centre and move to Marina eventually. And it will under redevelopment. In the next 2 decade after Jurong Lake Precint, Singapore will build its Southern City which starts from Shenton all the way to Pasir Panjang. Yes, all of Shenton will go, nothing will be left to build again.

It's no surprise that we are now seeing monitor lizards, otters, crocodiles, hornbills, deer, wild boars in greater numbers than any time since Independence. Sungei Buloh Wetlands was not an accident. It was an idea conceived by the Malayan Nature Society in 1986 and taken up by the authorities.

I mentioned codes earlier but in time the codes will specify the type of building materials that will be amazing, sustainable and blends with nature. Let me not let the cat out of bag.

We know what we are doing and having been doing it for 40 ever years. The rainfall falling thru our specially created gaps in our flyovers to water our plants and let a sliver of sunshine thru was born out of idea from the founder of the country.

Road signs in Singapore closely follow those laid down in the traffic sign regulations used in the United Kingdom, although a number of changes over the years have introduced some slight deviations that suit local road conditions (such as fonts). Road signs in Singapore conform to the local Highway Code under authority of the Singapore Traffic Police.

The Highway Code of Singapore Traffic Police is tested during the Basic Theory Test and Final Theory Test at either Ubi, Bukit Batok or Woodlands driving schools. The students are then to find either a school or private driving instructor to learn driving itself.

I have to say his view is not of any that you commented.

It's just different perspectives of views on the issue. He is just more environmentally tuned while y'all/most of SG are basically more into the economic benefits.

Tbh, it has always been difficult to compare the two but we cannot always think that economic pragmatism outweighhs everything.

What has this expressway have to do wtih Healthcare, since Healthcare is provided on a cluster basis and you won't need to send an ambulance from yishun to bukit timah? 

I would be really worried if our gdp growth is dependent on _building roads_ since on a land scarce island that sounds like it makes no economic sense.

P.s. I'm sure if you try a bit harder, you can make your arguments without having to rely on personal insults. Give it a go, I have hope in you.

110,10,erue8s5,t1_erucahr,"If those bunch of terms require explanation to you... You’re just making it easy for me to name call you. 

In the case of how the BKE contributes to the GDP in Singapore, let me make the most basic and simplest explanation: GDP = C + I + G (Government Expenditure) + NX. So just by the Government maintaining the BKE through spending on market-available services, GDP directly increases. This however, is non-exhaustive. People that use the BKE en-route to their business dealings in JB also contributes to economic growth. In fact, there is sooooo much more that a piece of infrastructure like the BKE can contribute to GDP.

In the case of healthcare and specifically ambulances in your case, I don’t know if you drive, but if you require EMT services at the northern part of the country, chances are, you will take the BKE to the nearest hospital.

It takes 2 hands to clap, and how are there going to be enough enforcers going around controlling every single clusterfuck there is in view of phase 2 reopening?  


And the point of ""failure of enforcement"" brings me to my point about how phase 2 revoked, simply because it was done **too prematurely, too soon.** Did the G not learn from the lessons gleaned from the day before circuit breaker? Where all hell broke loose and everyone rushed to queue for bubble teas and gathered for huge social gatherings to celebrate the last day of CB, all of which are counter-intuitive to the principles of a circuit breaker.   


Just like how we rushed into CB where establishments had to close overnight, suddenly we find ourselves rushing into Phase 2 where establishments are opening overnight. This is a recipe for disaster, borne from complacence. Especially when there are clearly asymptomatic threats out there waiting to blow up!

I still don't quite understand how he's being racist though, being racist is discrimination/bias due to race, right? 
But he's talking about the differing policies in different countries, and the reactions to the crisis due to the culture, media and policies implemented in those countries. 

I don't think we should slap a 'racist' label just because he stated a negative opinion of the situation in another country. 
it feels like we're shutting down a conversation with just one word. And using 'racist' to invalidate his point of view.

512,10,gkhtytj,t1_gkhefw5,"Yeah I wonder which part of Australia they were from. Backyard pythons (and a variety of highly venomous snakes) seem to be a regular occurrence in some cities.

Any snakes rescued by ACRES are released back into the wild, usually in more remote places where they're less likely to wander back into urban areas. The issue though is that several studies in various countries have shown that many species of snakes have a home range, and once they're relocated, many individuals struggle to survive - they've been placed in a completely unfamiliar environment, and their first instinct is to wander all over the place, trying to find their way back to where they came from. In the meantime, they have to figure out where to find food, and to find suitable basking spots and shelter, and have to contend with other members of the same species that are already occupying the area. If it's in a region where hibernation is a necessary survival strategy, it often means that the relocated snake hasn't found the best place to spend the winter, and has wasted precious energy and reserves instead of preparing for hibernation. But I guess relocation is still a better option compared to killing the snake on the spot, or forcing people to accept having it released back into their neighbourhood, especially for large constrictors and highly venomous species.

In Singapore, there was a study several years back where rescued Reticulated Pythons were microchipped, then released, so that they could be identified if they were ever found again, and also included some radio tracking work, but I'm not sure if the data from that project has been published yet.

What this also implies is that snakes encountered in urban areas or in backyards and gardens might not necessarily be lost; for species that can adapt to urban areas, like the Reticulated Python, they could have been residing in the area all along, staying out of sight most of the time, and happened to stray indoors or were unlucky enough to get spotted just once. It's possible that the python involved in this incident had been living in the area for a long time, unnoticed, and didn't cause any alarm until now.",t3_l39842,24-01-2021

514,10,gkcl3oa,t1_gkc688x,"Like what others have shared, pythons are ambush predators, so while they're quite slow most of the time, they can put on a surprising burst of speed when necessary. A python that's on the hunt is content to find a suitable hiding spot, often close to areas frequented by potential prey, waiting until a suitable target wanders into striking range.

If the initial strike is successful, the python immediately [throws a couple of coils](https://youtu.be/B4njHZ7g2hg) around the victim and starts squeezing. Rows of [long, sharp, backwards-facing teeth](https://www.alamy.com/skull-of-a-large-reticulated-python-snake-malayopython-reticulatus-seen-from-the-right-side-on-a-black-background-image340103906.html ) prevent the prey item from struggling free easily.

520,10,gkhw72x,t1_gkh0teq,"I think the basic level of adult supervision should suffice. Your son is more likely to get hurt by another human being, or by a poorly trained pet dog. But it would help to instill some awareness of the potential risks - much like how we teach road safety, teach your son to steer clear of drains, dense vegetation, or long grass - all sorts of snakes and other wildlife will hide in these areas. When he's older, teach him to pay attention to his surroundings, and to keep a safe distance from any animal unless he's checked and it's alright to get closer (e.g. petting the friendly stray cat, or playing with a friend's or neighbour's dog). But at the same time, bring him out on hikes and walks in the parks, so that he gets the chance to learn how to safely interact with a wide variety of creatures. Get him to learn that while the world may be full of animals (and people!) that seem scary or dangerous,  the best way to avoid getting hurt is to simply respect their space and to not disturb them.

Predatory attacks by pythons on humans are rare, and usually involve very large individuals (7+ metres) - the ones that have been recently reported took place in rural areas of Indonesia, on the island of Sulawesi. We have no way of knowing whether there are more unreported cases, especially for communities that live deep in forests, but in any case, pythons in Singapore don't seem to reach such sizes; very few seem to grow beyond 4 or 5 metres. It's also interesting that while pythons in forested areas of Sumatra shift from rats to medium-sized mammals such as mousedeer, monkeys, and even wild boar as they grow larger, pythons of all sizes in Singapore, even the largest ones, appear to rely primarily on rats.

Although smaller pythons could theoretically go after children, the general impression is that compared to other animals, humans would be very difficult prey to swallow, due to the width of the shoulders.

In neighbouring countries, there are way more reported cases of adults (mostly men) who tried to catch or tackle a python by themselves, but ended up being overpowered when the snake defended itself and managed to coil around its attacker. In these cases, the pythons were typically too small to consider humans as prey, but inadvertently killed people in self-defense.

In contrast, most python-inflicted injuries in Singapore seem to arise when people were standing too close to a python or were trying to catch one, and then got bitten.",t3_l39842,24-01-2021

Of course, it also depends on whether the intended victim is still alive or not, and whether the snake is desperately hungry. A snake is actually very vulnerable to other predators while it's in the midst of feeding, and snakes are quite fragile, so if it thinks that there's a very real risk of serious, even fatal injury, it's more likely to abandon the hunt if it's not going to be able to feed in peace.",t3_l39842,24-01-2021

Singapore is a land of merit. If there are work pass holders that can't understand the simple instruction that has been announced, advised and warned multiple times in various medias, then it is either that they don't have the mental capacity to understand simple instructions or just rebellious and like to challenge the authority.

Having either one of those traits, are not helping Singapore's cause in being the most competitive economy in the world. I think every Singaporean believes that we don't need these work pass holders in our country.

This isn't much of a problem.

There's no charge for tapping out the same place you tapped in.

Two people could feasibly meet from separate stations on the train itself or just outside the doors, then go back to their respective starting points - and tap out there.

No cost for either assuming they weren't inside the system for the limit, which I believe is 3 hours.

This is helpful for obvious reasons, I've tapped through, sat and waited for the train only to realize that I left something at home and had to leave.

Nondescript is right.

In fact nondescript made the previous building so much less obtrusive and unpretentious, just as Holland v shopping center is, harmonious to the HV street character. The windmill was a whimsical add on, which wasn’t key to the equation. It did however play into the experience and memory of some people.

This current one must have cost a lot effort and money to build, an attempt at futuristic expression,  tries hard to stand out, an egoistical  object. Whoever made those decisions did not consider what made Holland village special to people, it’s the interesting terrain, interesting mix  of shops, against a backdrop of Low-rise nondescript buildings that flowed with the gentle rise and fall of the terrain. 

If we keep at this developer addiction of building unnecessary frivolous ‘iconic’ looking buildings for every plot of land there, it will become a showroom of architectural fetish, and what made Holland v special to most people before  will likely fade.

> As phase 2 allowed for gatherings of up to 5 people and allowed for dine-in, many rushed to do so on the night of June 19, which happened to be a Friday.

> While safe-distancing measures are still in place, there have been several Facebook and Instagram posts showing crowds of people gathering at Holland Village, with one particularly viral photo featuring a long queue of people.

> Some of the patrons were not wearing masks, they also did not appear to keep a safe distance from other groups.

> Other photos have been floated around social media regarding the apparent crowds in Holland Village.

> Masagos responds

> In a Facebook post on June 19, environment and water resources minister Masagos Zulkifli said that he understands that there have been crowds gathering in other areas as well as Holland Village.

> He assured that the government will step up patrols of nightspots, and will take enforcement actions against operators and individuals who breach safe distancing measures.

> ""Observing the spirit of the law is as important as adhering to the letter of the law,"" Masagos said. ""As Gan Kim Yong put it — we can fool the rules, but we cannot fool the virus.""

> Masagos mentioned that Covid-19 remains a threat and that the public should continue to practise safe-distancing measures.

> He also reminded the public to put their mask back on after eating and drinking and minimising physical interaction and the duration of the meeting as much as possible.

> ""By maintaining the good habits that we have been practising during the circuit breaker period and in Phase 1, we can create a COVID-safe environment for everyone, as we go about our daily lives"", Masagos said.

802,10,ea4wb4x,t1_ea3zhmm,"Actually, the Dutch Police Force has an answer for you, and they are worried that The Netherlands is becoming a narco-state.

A recent report by the Dutch Police Union warns that ""the Netherlands is starting to resemble a narco-state with the police unable to combat the emergence of a parallel criminal economy."" Some have criticized ""[the sale of cannabis in coffee shops](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/29/netherlands-coffee-shops-cannabis-terneuzen-checkpoint-cafe), and the legal status of prostitution in the country, claim\[ing\] \[that\] the Netherlands has been inadvertently promoted as a major hub for the trafficking of drugs and people.""

According to statistics released by Europol, ""a large majority of ecstasy taken in Europe and the US comes from labs in the south of \[the Netherlands\], which are increasingly run by Moroccan gangs involved in the production of cannabis. Half of the €5.7bn a year of cocaine taken in [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news) comes through the port of Rotterdam.""

In fact, the potential parallels to Singapore are quite unnerving, as academics have posited that ""the very efficient infrastructure in The Netherlands aid the growth of *illegal economies,* just as much as they help its *legal economy.* The advanced ports and digital finance systems the Dutch are famous for, are also used to traffic drugs and move around dirty money.""

So while you may think that you were making a joke, the reality on the ground (as reflected by the report) suggests that there are negative side effects of their country's soft policy on drugs, and that these consequences are only beginning to emerge.

> One eatery, British Indian Curry Hut, was shut down for flouting measures to resume activities safely, while individuals in the vicinity were also fined for violating safe distancing rules.

> Holland Village, a popular haunt with the expat community in Singapore and yuppie crowd, was relatively quieter on Saturday night, despite it being the start of the weekend.

> The dinner crowd was visibly more sparse, partly due to the rain, and at 9:30pm, the watering holes along Lorong Mambong were seen having ample standing room.

> Police officers were seen patrolling the area in their vehicles.

> They were also seen approaching at least one group of youths congregating at the hawker centre.

> Police officers showed up at the Holland Village Market at around 9:15pm, after a group of five or more youths were seen gathering for drinks there in a small group and talking loudly, while gesticulating animatedly amongst themselves.

> They were dispersed shortly.

> The Outdoor Refreshment Areas (ORA) and on the road along Lorong Mambong in Holland Village have been removed a day after phase two started as large crowds were seen gathered there on Friday night.

> Background

> The government announced it will be taking businesses and individuals to task after they were found not to have cooperated with the measures to resume activities safely when the phase two reopening occurred in Singapore on Friday, June 19.

> This warning was sounded by National Development Lawrence Wong in a Facebook post on June 20.

> Wong, who is the co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce, wrote that the authorities were alerted to large crowds gathering around the Outdoor Refreshment Areas (ORA) and on the road along Lorong Mambong in Holland Village.

> Based on their inspections, the crowds were largely gathering outside one restaurant, the British Indian Curry Hut.

> The restaurant was subsequently closed with immediate effect.

> Enforcement officers have also issued fines to individuals in the vicinity for violating safe distancing rules.

> Wong said that individuals will be fined, even if it’s his or her first offence.

> Those holding work passes risk having their passes revoked, he added.

> Investigations are ongoing for other possible breaches.

> The carpark with 47 parking spaces, located on the basement level of the shopping centre, has a strata floor area of 1,503 square metres and is zoned commercial, marketing agent Edmund Tie said yesterday.

> It is not subject to additional buyer's stamp duty or seller's stamp duty, and is eligible for purchase by both local and foreign buyers.

> Key tenants of Holland Road Shopping Centre include Cold Storage, United Overseas Bank, Watsons and Guardian Pharmacy.

> The mall has a 78m wide frontage along Holland Avenue, and is situated at the entrance of the Holland Village or Chip Bee Gardens precinct.

> Ms Swee Shou Fern, Edmund Tie's executive director of investment advisory, said strata-titled carparks are tightly held and rarely available for sale. Strategically located in a lifestyle hub, the carpark offers ""strong and steady cash flow"", she added.

> The upcoming development of One Holland Village by Far East Organization is set to inject more buzz into the Holland Village/Chip Bee Gardens precinct. One Holland Village is a mixed-use development featuring about 550 residential and serviced apartment units, offices, retail and food and beverage spaces.

> An estimated 2,400 housing units from new projects are also under development in the vicinity.

> The carpark is owned by a low-profile investor, said Edmund Tie, adding that it is being marketed as a carpark and alternative uses have not been explored.

> ""Such an investment opportunity is hard to come by and we expect keen interest from investors who wish to capitalise on the tight supply of parking spaces in this bustling enclave, with potential capital upside from a collective sale,"" Ms Swee added.

> The carpark's EOI exercise will close on Nov 20 at 3pm.

Breakfast options: very limited. Mostly eggs and toast. Most businesses don't open early. Walk to marine parade hawker center 5 mins away for more choices.

Traffic: since katong is essentially one long narrow road, jams may occur during weekends. 

Night time: very quiet. Not like it used to be. Since all the shady bars are closed down. Hungry at night? Better order in fast food. All businesses closed.

Weekday lunch: office crowds. Eat early or late. Can't find any seats anywhere around 1pm. But they'll leave pretty quickly. Eat around 12 if u don't wanna wait. Pricey joints are always empty tho.

Cabs rides: hailing one on the street is impossible. Go queue at the nearby malls. 112 katong or katong shopping centre. There's uber of course.

Katong is quaint, low key and relaxed. Quite the opposite of Holland V. Many expat families live around here. You'll probably see them only on a weekend tho.

852,10,dss1tl6,t1_dss0kt2,"Hello and welcome to Singapore in advance :) 

1. Location 
  Is traveling time important to you?  If so then my honest opinion, from what I gather about your wants, would be Holland village. It's ease of access will be easier compared to Katong. In HV, you have buses and trains. In Katong, you have to bus first before going to any nearby trains. HV will also allow you to meet people more easily and travel out for days when you don't need to work. 

2. Beach 
  If the beach is an important factor, you should then stay at Katong. However, there are people who have cycled from wherever they live, be it the north, south and west of SG to East Coast Park (ECP). I have friends who live in the east area (Katong included) and the ease of bike riding to ECP is easy and makes for good get aways. However, they do wish that they are close to central SG so as to cut travel as they have to take two forms of transport to get anywhere, mainly bus first then the train or bus and another bus. 

3. Food Prices 
  It will be cheaper in Katong especially if you stay near the Roxy square mall area as there are many cheaper food options and the wet market in the main area called Marine Parade where there is also a mall called Parkway Parade. HV will be slightly costlier because of its location advantages as well as it naturally attracting people due to the food choices as well as the location itself ( where families come to visit nearby areas and then dropping in HV to eat ) However, I don't think the prices will differ much because the Marine Parade area host many people and prices are bound to be slightly higher due to convenience which might equate to the same prices in HV. 

4. Things to do 
  The location of HV allows your to travel easily with the nearby connections of the Circle Line (Mass Rapid Transport or MRT for short) and this allows you to move around SG fairly easily. In addition the bus connections you have in that area is slightly better than that of Katong. (But I may be wrong and will be open to other advice/feedback) 
I you like to bike or run, both locations are fair as you can get to places with the bike. For running it depends if you are okay with 'city life' running where it's asphalt running or you want to head to the ECP to run. 

5. Personal Opinion 
Although it seems like I'm leaning more towards HV, I have tried to give my best opinions on Katong. I stay in the central part of SG (Toa Payoh) and have gone to school in the Katong area for 5 years. I did not particularly like having to be in the East because I really enjoyed the convenience being in the central region. But I think that the East really does have its perks too because in Katong you will have 2 malls nearby and the beach and ease of access into the city due to the expressway should you need an Uber or taxi. 
That said, it really depends on what you would like. :) ",t3_7qu5xk,16-01-2018
853,10,dss3m22,t1_dss0kt2,"Yep sounds about right but I haven’t been to katong area recently. There are some new malls there (112) so my impression of the area is that it’s an older, quieter neighbourhood.",t3_7qu5xk,16-01-2018
854,10,dssdl05,t1_dss8el5,"In that case, the katong location might be more favourable to you. Will be lovely to do your training runs along east coast park while watching the planes land. There are also plenty of bars along east coast road and other amenities.

Only downside is no access to the MRT (subway). But the buses are pretty good here, will probably take you about 30 mins to get to business district.

The man (Janggut) who invented and popularized Katong laksa passed away and none of his kids took over. Nancy, who had no ties to them, took over the space and started the 328 chain. However there are 2 surviving family members making the orignal Laksa (Janggut's brother used to make and sell laksa together with Janggut).

873,10,fvldghs,t3_hdi5uc,">Dr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst with management consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, said such five-year plans are meant to give the electorate an idea of what the ruling party intends to accomplish at both the national and municipal levels between one election and the next.

>""(These plans) are meant to demonstrate to the electorate that this is what good leadership looks like, thinking ahead for the mid and long-term,"" said Dr Mustafa.

This statement implies a few assumptions: (1) the incumbent expects to retain their power in these areas, so that their plans can be carried out, and (2) the opposition doesn't have adequate power to build/improve infrastructure for their residents if they get elected (and partly because they have no such five-year plans), and (3) if the opposition does win, the residents will have no chance to enjoy these infrastructure.

The third assumption is especially glaring, because imo, plans to improve lifestyles/infrastructure of Singaporeans should never be abandoned just because the plans were made by a different party. 

Not saying the opposition will definitely block such plans, but other mechanisms are also in play here.",t3_hdi5uc,22-06-2020
