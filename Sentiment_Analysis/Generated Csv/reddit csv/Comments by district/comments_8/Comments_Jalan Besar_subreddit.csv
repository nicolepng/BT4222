2,8,fx028p5,t3_hllgkv,i mean probably better for him to deliver the entire speech if the others cant speak well enough to express the points as clearly as he did. i also feel like his points also kinda made sense and the part where he shat on joteo also quite smart lor but alot ppl shitting on him also but idk la idk politics,t3_hllgkv,05-07-2020

MOM has always been a troubled ministry, but I think it has never been directly arrowed in elections. (E.g.

The COVID-19 situation has placed them in the spotlight, so hopefully whoever takes over her will be able to make real changes.

> Manpower Minister Josephine Teo will be contesting in Jalan Besar GRC with her team: Heng Chee How, Denise Phua, and newcomer Wan Rizal.

> Both Heng and Phua are currently Members of Parliament representing Jalan Besar GRC. Teo is being moved over from the Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, while Wan Rizal is a first-time candidate.

> Current MPs of Jalan Besar GRC Yaacob Ibrahim and Lily Neo will be stepping down.

> Speaking to the media this morning (June 29) at Beo Crescent Market, Teo said that she experienced the warmth that Jalan Besar constituency residents have for Yaacob and Neo when she walked around the area:

> ""They are very well-loved and I think they will be missed very much by all our residents. They have also left us very big shoes and so the next team knows that this is a very high level of commitment that we must also continue to demonstrate.""

> Teo also highlighted the veteran MPs in her team — Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng and Mayor of Central District Phua who have more than three decades of service between them:

> ""Chee How has been serving in Whampoa since 2001 — so 19 years. Denise has been serving in Kampong Glam since 2006 — 14 plus years....much of the transformation that you see around Jalan Besar — they had a hand in it.""

> Despite all of the change that Heng and Phua had effected in their constituency, both told Teo that they value, above all, the relationship and bond with residents that were cultivated over the years.

> ""So if you ask me, I think for the Jalan Besar team that the PAP is fielding this election, the most important asset is the relationship and the bonding that we have with the residents,"" said Teo.

> ""So Rizal and I have the honour and privilege to serve alongside Chee How and Denise if the residents give us the opportunity.""

> Teo added that she is aware that it takes years of interacting with residents and nurturing relationships but the one thing that she wants to focus on right now is getting to know the residents in the Jalan Besar constituency.

(Also by allowing the dorms to be in these conditions during her tenure - been about 2 yrs alr - even if she didn’t set it up she did implicitly agree to let it go on this long until the pandemic hit). 

But more importantly she’s said way too many meme-able lines at this point. I have friends who dk who JoTeo is by name but they know there’s a female mp who said you don’t need a lot of space to have sex.

Her ministry send messy, unorganised messages on workplace practices for companies. Go ask around, what a nightmare it was for HR personnel during Covid. 

And her statement on trying to be in touch with Singaporeans and commenting that employers do not have the right to look at your past salaries? Guess what, I actually have to show past salaries if I want to enter civil service. Whoopies daises amirite?

original comment by u/_sagittarivs

 Jo Teo's Pearls of Wisdom:

1. You need a small space to have sex. meet tonight and can make a baby.. This caused a lot of backlash from society. The context was missing and the words used can be improved. i.e. Referring to the western world, and almost imply casual sex
2. Buy any cheap milk powder and no need a big brand. Support her with the statement but the concern from the ground was of why milk powder here is so much ex compared to JB or other nations. People interpreted her statement like 'you get million $, so it's cheap for you'
3. mother hens or something is seen as sexist. don't recall well
4. minimum wage comments. no biggie again
5. Dorm Operators & inhumane conditions of FW. Her comments ""when we asked Dorm Operators to improve standards, we were told costs will go up"" so we didn't do much.
6. Being against raising NS pay cause ""service to the country cannot be measured in dollars and cents"".
7. 'No worker demanded an apology'
8. *Ms Teo said that if a company bases the applicant’s “worth to the organisation” solely on the last-drawn pay, her advice to jobseekers would be: “Look for another employer. This is not a company that you should spend too much on.” However, in reality, while there are no such rules, about 95 per cent of employers, local and international firms, routinely ask for candidates’ last-drawn salaries in physical or online application forms and jobseekers rarely resist.*",t3_hhwroc,29-06-2020
