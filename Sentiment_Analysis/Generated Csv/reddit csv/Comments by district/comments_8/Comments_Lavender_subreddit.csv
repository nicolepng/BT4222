> Everyone loves ice cream on their birthday.

> For ice cream man Jimmy Teng, it means giving out 1,000 free ice creams on his birthday.

> In a photo that surfaced [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hinamasayafrhn/status/976705572547342336) on March 22, 2018, Teng had a sign at his stand saying ‚Äú1000 free ice cream 72 birthday.‚Äù

> Teng is stationed outside Lavender MRT station near the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) building, his usual haunt for the past 14 years.

> This is the original tweet:

> This is the photo in case you can‚Äôt see it:

> 

> Affectionately known by many as Uncle Jimmy, this is not the first year that he has given out free ice cream during his birthday.

> In fact, it is his third time.

> On his 70th birthday in 2016, he had announced on his Facebook page that he would be¬†giving out 700 servings of free ice cream to mark his birthday.

> The New Paper [reported](http://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/ice-cream-man-gives-out-free-ice-cream-70th-birthday) that he prepared 1,000 servings instead, which cost him several hundred dollars, and¬†managed to give out about 900 servings after six hours.

> He also told TNP this gesture was his way of thanking his customers for their support.

> This year, he also prepared 1,000 free servings.

> Happy birthday, Uncle Jimmy.
