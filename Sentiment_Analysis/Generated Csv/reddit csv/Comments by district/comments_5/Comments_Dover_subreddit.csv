> The Dover forest that is adjacent to the Ulu Pandan Park Connector used to be abandoned kampungs and plantations.

> It has since been turned into a huge patch of lush secondary forest after 40 years home to over 200 species of wildlife, including threatened ones, according to an environmental baseline study published by the Housing Development Board (HDB).

> However, the study was done in view of upcoming housing plans that will replace the forest with high-rise residential buildings.

> On HDB's website, Dover forest is known as the Ulu Pandan estate.

> Nature Society feedback on housing plans

> In a bid to safeguard this secondary forest and its wild inhabitants, the Nature Society Singapore's (NSS) conservation committee has made public its feedback to HDB in relation to the environmental baseline study on Dover Forest.

> Members of the public are welcome to provide their feedback to HDB as well.

> The feedback window which started last December will close on Jan. 16, 2021.

> Threatened species in Dover forest

> The 13-page feedback from NSS highlighted that there are actually more threatened species in the forest than what the study had found in 2017.

> The committee also proposed for the 33-hectare forest to be turned into a park because the conservation significance of the forest revealed from the baseline study has become ""very glaring"".

> In addition, the committee also offered alternative sites for housing projects.

> Endangered species of birds in forest

> In their feedback, NSS said the Dover forest used to be even bigger and part of it has already been subjected to development.

> The remaining forest has since thrived, matured and the wildlife richness has increased ""considerably"".

> The number of bird species has more than doubled over years, from 36 species recorded in 2007 to 82 species recorded in the baseline study.

> NSS added that there are actually 21 more species inhabiting Dover forest, based on NSS's list.

> While 12 bird species recorded in the baseline study are nationally near-threatened or threatened, NSS revealed that there are five more endangered species recorded based on their list.

> Two species spotted in the forest are globally endangered — the Straw-headed Bulbul and the Long-tailed Parakeet.

> While the two species are thriving in Singapore, long-tailed parakeets are pretty common here.

> NSS emphasised that their global populations are dwindling.

> A total of 31 forest-dependent bird species have been spotted in Dover forest instead of 22 species, NSS added.

> Due to limited time, the feedback strategically focuses on the bird species only.

> The fact that birds are thriving in the Dover forest shows rich biodiversity at lower levels of the food chain.

> Birds have varying diets ranging from honey, fruits and seeds, insects, reptiles, amphibians and mammals.

> Ecological value

> Besides being home to wildlife, Dover forest enhances the wildlife connectivity in the region.

> Wildlife can use Dover forest as a ""stepping stone"" to a number of other green spaces, such as the mangrove area east of Pandan Reservoir, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Clementi forest and forests of the Southern Ridges.

> The red arrows show how wild animals can use Dover forest to move to other forests:

> NSS said it believes that this explains the presence of the Straw headed Bulbul and Long-tailed Parakeet.

> These birds, which come from other forests, could be foraging for food or searching for a new home in Dover forest.

> A demand for more green recreational spaces

> Besides the conservation and ecological value, NSS also said it believes that there is an ""accelerated"" demand for recreational greenery.

> Streams of visitors have been observed at Central Catchment Nature Reserve’s Tree-Top Trail on weekends and people want to get close to nature for various benefits.

> Another example that NSS cited is how an ""astounding"" number of people are flocking to Clementi forest recently.

> Therefore, it is urgent to expand green spaces so that existing nature parks and reserves will not get eroded or degraded due to overuse.

> Furthermore, there is a lack of a public park in that Dover/ Ulu Pandan estate.

> NSS has counter-proposed the conservation of the entire Dover forest by turning it into a public and nature park.

> Public park counter-proposal

> The park will consist of three parts:

> 1) Wildlife core and corridor area,

> 2) Public park area and

> 3) Community garden and recreational facilities area.

> 1) Wildlife core and corridor area

> This part of the forest is relatively denser and further from human activity and noise.

> Both western and eastern sectors of the forest will have a core area where endangered birds have been spotted using or residing within.

> The core areas also consists of a freshwater stream running through the forest. The freshwater stream is an endangered wildlife habitat outside the existing nature reserves.

> While this area should be left untouched, a trail can be created nearer to the northern boundary of the forest corridor for the public to enjoy a venturesome experience within the forest.

> 2) Public park area

> Nearer to the park connector, the public park area can be developed for recreational and exercise purposes.

> 3) Community garden and recreational facilities area

> A community garden area and other amenities, such as food courts for the public, can be created near Dover MRT station, NSS said.

> While these two areas can be more manicured, there should be some shrubs or small trees planted to reduce the gap of wildlife connectivity between the two sectors of the forest.

> Housing projects can use other open spaces and golf course

> As part of the feedback, NSS also proposed three alternatives for housing projects to be carried out in Dover and Ulu Pandan:

> Open patch at the junction of Ghim Moh Road and Commonwealth Avenue West (about 3.5 hectares) Degazetted Warren Golf Course to the east of Medway Park (about 3.5 hectares) Open patch at the junction of Dover Road and North Buona Vista Road, opposite INSEAD (about 14.5 hectares)

> In addition, NSS also recommended a revamp of old industrial sites, roads, car parks and transport hubs, as well as more degazetting of golf courses to meet Singaporeans' housing needs so that the remaining mature forests can be conserved.

> Have any feedback on Dover forest's environmental baseline study?

> You have less than 24 hours left to submit your feedback to HDB.

> Click here to do so.

**So much land for golf courses?**  
September 6, 2000 

TWO Saturdays ago, Singaporeans were presented with a stark choice. They were told the country would soon run out of space and they must choose – through proxy – either to allocate more land for parks or for factories and warehouses. Actually their choices are much wider than that. 

The park or factory scenario was presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, a statutory board conducting its once-a-decade review of the Concept Plan, the blueprint for Singapore’s physical development. 

Based on a target population of 5.5 million (up from four million today), URA said Singapore needs 16,000 hectares of land for development. This comprises 8000 ha for housing, 6000 ha for industries and 2000 ha for parks. As the available land is only 12,000 ha, there would be a shortfall of 4000 ha, which necessitates hard choices. 

On the surface, the choice is thrown open to the public, which will respond through two committees whose members are carefully selected by the URA. In practice, the URA may already be disposed to giving more land for industries. 

In background material to the press, the URA said “currently we have about 0.67 ha of park land per 1000 persons. If we want to have more space…we would then need to put aside additional 2000 ha of land. As a comparison, in Hongkong, 1000 persons share 0.15 ha of parks”. 

This seemingly neutral set of figures carries a powerful message. Singapore and Hong Kong are rival economies. If people here are already enjoying more than four times the park allocation in Hong Kong, it would be a small sacrifice to let go of some parkland for factories, if the return is greater prosperity for all. 

There are two points in such an argument that have to be scrutinised. The first, as pointed out by an e-mail sent by reader Ngiam Shih Tung is that the comparison is not correct. 

Drawing on his experience in Hong Kong – “I have seen a lot more countryside than in Singapore” – Mr Ngiam checked out the official websites of both the Hong Kong and Singapore governments. To his surprise, he found that 84 per cent of land in Hong Kong was not built-up, compared to 50 per cent in Singapore.””Possibly, URA is only counting urban parks, but in terms of land use, nature areas have recreational uses as well and should be included,” Mr Ngiam said. 

Using official figures, Mr Ngiam estimated that Hong Kong has 63,000 ha of “parkland” and water catchment areas (all of which could be used by the public). This works out to 6.4 ha per 1000 people. In Singapore, after including places such as Pulau Ubin, there are 5459 ha of parkland, or 1.4 ha per 1000 people. 

This means Hong Kongers, instead of having only a quarter of the per capita parkland that Singaporeans have, are actually enjoying four to five times as much as the people here. From the perspective of quality of life, it would seem that Singapore, if it wants to keep up with Hong Kong, should do with less industries and more parks. 

Comparisons apart, URA also did not mention golf courses when it presented Singaporeans with a choice of parks or industries. Under the 1991 Concept Plan, URA had catered for a staggering 29 golf courses in Singapore, up from the 14 already in existence. Land, which could have been used for parks, has been reserved for golf courses. How much land is put aside is not known. 

Currently, the 14 golf courses are sitting on 1400 ha of land. Another 15 courses would presumably occupy 1500-2000 ha. This means the land reserved for golf courses is almost as big as that reserved for parks. 

This raises some questions. As Singapore is already dotted with golf courses, is it necessary to build more? (Ask any veteran golfer and he would say that Singapore and southern Malaysia already have the highest concentration of golf courses in the world). 

In other words, we would be putting aside as much land for golf, enjoyed by a minority, as for parks for the entire population. The proper choice, therefore, is not just between parks and industries. Land reserved for golf courses would have to be considered as well. And, of course, there is one last question – would the committees set up by URA now look at golf courses, even though they have not been briefed by the URA to do so?",t3_kycmnz,16-01-2021

> The Dover forest that is adjacent to the Ulu Pandan Park Connector used to be abandoned kampungs and plantations.

> It has since been turned into a huge patch of lush secondary forest after 40 years home to over 200 species of wildlife, including threatened ones, according to an environmental baseline study published by the Housing Development Board (HDB).

> However, the study was done in view of upcoming housing plans that will replace the forest with high-rise residential buildings.

> On HDB's website, Dover forest is known as the Ulu Pandan estate.

> Nature Society feedback on housing plans

> In a bid to safeguard this secondary forest and its wild inhabitants, the Nature Society Singapore's (NSS) conservation committee has made public its feedback to HDB in relation to the environmental baseline study on Dover Forest.

> Members of the public are welcome to provide their feedback to HDB as well.

> The feedback window which started last December will close on Jan. 16, 2021.

> Threatened species in Dover forest

> The 13-page feedback from NSS highlighted that there are actually more threatened species in the forest than what the study had found in 2017.

> The committee also proposed for the 33-hectare forest to be turned into a park because the conservation significance of the forest revealed from the baseline study has become ""very glaring"".

> In addition, the committee also offered alternative sites for housing projects.

> Endangered species of birds in forest

> In their feedback, NSS said the Dover forest used to be even bigger and part of it has already been subjected to development.

> The remaining forest has since thrived, matured and the wildlife richness has increased ""considerably"".

> The number of bird species has more than doubled over years, from 36 species recorded in 2007 to 82 species recorded in the baseline study.

> NSS added that there are actually 21 more species inhabiting Dover forest, based on NSS's list.

> While 12 bird species recorded in the baseline study are nationally near-threatened or threatened, NSS revealed that there are five more endangered species recorded based on their list.

> Two species spotted in the forest are globally endangered — the Straw-headed Bulbul and the Long-tailed Parakeet.

> While the two species are thriving in Singapore, long-tailed parakeets are pretty common here.

> NSS emphasised that their global populations are dwindling.

> A total of 31 forest-dependent bird species have been spotted in Dover forest instead of 22 species, NSS added.

> Due to limited time, the feedback strategically focuses on the bird species only.

> The fact that birds are thriving in the Dover forest shows rich biodiversity at lower levels of the food chain.

> Birds have varying diets ranging from honey, fruits and seeds, insects, reptiles, amphibians and mammals.

> Ecological value

> Besides being home to wildlife, Dover forest enhances the wildlife connectivity in the region.

> Wildlife can use Dover forest as a ""stepping stone"" to a number of other green spaces, such as the mangrove area east of Pandan Reservoir, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Clementi forest and forests of the Southern Ridges.

> The red arrows show how wild animals can use Dover forest to move to other forests:

> NSS said it believes that this explains the presence of the Straw headed Bulbul and Long-tailed Parakeet.

> These birds, which come from other forests, could be foraging for food or searching for a new home in Dover forest.

> A demand for more green recreational spaces

> Besides the conservation and ecological value, NSS also said it believes that there is an ""accelerated"" demand for recreational greenery.

> Streams of visitors have been observed at Central Catchment Nature Reserve’s Tree-Top Trail on weekends and people want to get close to nature for various benefits.

> Another example that NSS cited is how an ""astounding"" number of people are flocking to Clementi forest recently.

> Therefore, it is urgent to expand green spaces so that existing nature parks and reserves will not get eroded or degraded due to overuse.

> Furthermore, there is a lack of a public park in that Dover/ Ulu Pandan estate.

> NSS has counter-proposed the conservation of the entire Dover forest by turning it into a public and nature park.

> Public park counter-proposal

> The park will consist of three parts:

> 1) Wildlife core and corridor area,

> 2) Public park area and

> 3) Community garden and recreational facilities area.

> 1) Wildlife core and corridor area

> This part of the forest is relatively denser and further from human activity and noise.

> Both western and eastern sectors of the forest will have a core area where endangered birds have been spotted using or residing within.

> The core areas also consists of a freshwater stream running through the forest. The freshwater stream is an endangered wildlife habitat outside the existing nature reserves.

> While this area should be left untouched, a trail can be created nearer to the northern boundary of the forest corridor for the public to enjoy a venturesome experience within the forest.

> 2) Public park area

> Nearer to the park connector, the public park area can be developed for recreational and exercise purposes.

> 3) Community garden and recreational facilities area

> A community garden area and other amenities, such as food courts for the public, can be created near Dover MRT station, NSS said.

> While these two areas can be more manicured, there should be some shrubs or small trees planted to reduce the gap of wildlife connectivity between the two sectors of the forest.

> Housing projects can use other open spaces and golf course

> As part of the feedback, NSS also proposed three alternatives for housing projects to be carried out in Dover and Ulu Pandan:

> Open patch at the junction of Ghim Moh Road and Commonwealth Avenue West (about 3.5 hectares) Degazetted Warren Golf Course to the east of Medway Park (about 3.5 hectares) Open patch at the junction of Dover Road and North Buona Vista Road, opposite INSEAD (about 14.5 hectares)

> In addition, NSS also recommended a revamp of old industrial sites, roads, car parks and transport hubs, as well as more degazetting of golf courses to meet Singaporeans' housing needs so that the remaining mature forests can be conserved.

125,4,gjfqzce,t1_gjfhhc1,"Kind of weird how many times this talking point has come up.

Pretty much all the golf courses are not slated to have their leases renewed already. Everything except maybe Laguna/Tanah Merah/NSRCC are going to be gone when their leases expire over the next decade. Laguna/TMCC/NSRCC are slightly unique, because they're built adjacent to the airport and under the takeoff and landing vectors, so they're on land that can't be use for much stuff anyway, and some of their land is already being taken back by the government so the airport can expand.

As for the rest, pretty much all the existing courses (besides the one at Marina Bay) were built long before Singapore was even independent - at the time of their creation, they were in the midst of plantations, or out in the rural areas where very few people lived. When SG govt went independent, they had to deal with the golf courses leases because as the urban areas expanded, the courses ended up sitting on some prime land. 

So there were a few ways to proceed:  

1. The government wanted to buy up the leases as early as the 90s. Didn't quite work, because the clubs didn't want to sell.  

2. The government could've just invalidated the leases and evicted the clubs. *Terrible* idea, because not only would this not stand up in court, but if the govt succeeded and the court backed it, it would set a VERY BAD precedent of the govt being able to take back any land if they so desired. Which means houses or other pieces of land would be worthless since the govt can just arbitrarily evict you for their own reasons. No developer would want to take the risk of building anything if they risk not being able to recoup the costs.  

3. Wait for the leases to expire, and not grant any more lease extensions. So, when the golf course leases expire, the land ownership reverts back to the government, who can then re-develop it for their own purposes. And if anyone in Singapore complained about not having enough courses to play, they could simply just go to, what, Bali or Bintan, or up north to Malaysia or Thailand.

The govt picked option 3. They did so as far back as the mid-2000s when the clubs started to make noise about lease extensions - even commissioned a study to see if it was worth keeping the golf clubs around, only to come to the conclusion that the answer was no. They did it despite a pretty huge outcry by the clubs and their wealthy, influential members (I recall SICC made a pretty huge stink about it back in the day).

So, the whole thing about using the golf courses? *The government is already doing that*. The redevelopment of areas like Dover, and Tengah, are *in addition* to long term scheduled redevelopment of the golf courses. Point is, it's not a question of why Singapore has so many golf courses - the question was why the Brits allowed so many golf courses (and the answer for that was - Singapore was a colonial outpost and the imperial officials dispatched here needed relaxation facilities), and how is the SG government going to handle that in light of our limited land area.

(A small aside about Marina Bay, that one's a fairly unique case because that course was planned and built back when that area was very freshly reclaimed, pretty inaccessible, and not able to be built on. To put things into perspective, it was built a full 4 years before MBS was, and long before the Downtown Core concept was really implemented. And as it was built as a public course, the entire intention was to make use of the land for a short time period before they could redevelop it once the rest of the Marina Bay area was sufficiently built up. So it never went through the sort of lease conflict issues that the other golf courses did)",t3_kycmnz,16-01-2021

After independence, the SG govt renegotiated the terms of the leases because the golf clubs took up a lot of land, but was on land the government wasn't anywhere near using yet - with the understanding that while the leases could be renewed, they would eventually be phased out. In the meantime, though, they could still generate some economic use for SG, especially in the transition to a service economy since golfing was (and is) a popular sport among executives and HNWIs. The last renewal came around in the 80s and 90s where the govt originally wanted to buy out the clubs, but faced a lot of opposition from the clubs themselves, who defended their leases by pointing out that the land around the clubs could still be developed (since a lot were lacking transport links and weren't really used for much at the time).

So there was one supposedly final lease renewal to 2021, and at the same time, the govt started planning for more construction around the club locations so that when the leases expired, the govt could regain the land and use it for something else. As far back as the late 90s and early 2000s, the clubs were still believing that the govt would continue renewing their leases, and were shocked when they were told there would be no more lease extensions since the govt wanted to reacquire the land. There was a lot of negotiation, and a few clubs managed to get a really short extension into 2030-2040, but the ones around the areas that the govt had developed were not given lease extensions.  Keppel's one of the examples of surrounding development - govt constructed Vivo City and built up the mount faber and telok blangah areas around it so when the Keppel lease expired, the land can be reclaimed and slotted into the planned development for the area. Marina Bay's another example - with the exception that since it was a public golf course, there was much less opposition to it's closure since it was designed from the start to utilise comparatively cheaper land (at the time - remember, this was before MBS and Downtown Core, and the land was freshly reclaimed) with the understanding that once the area was further developed, it would be re-zoned.

So rather than evict the clubs early on land that wasn't immediately required, the govt decided to wait for the leases to progress before developing the areas around the clubs, and then taking over the clubs themselves. So that's why you saw Vivo City and other developments cropping up in the south just around the time Keppel realised their lease was expiring, and more development in the north around the time Seletar and Orchid have their leases scheduled to expire.

At the time, the government owned 76.2 percent of the land in Singapore compared with 31 percent in 1949.[7]The compulsory acquisition of land by the government was effective in keeping the costs of building houses and industrial premises affordable"".

Farms, plantations, cemeteries, etc. The Land Acquisition Act was controversial because it was fundamentally against one of the principles and unspoken rules on the sanctity of property - but the government judged that the need for urban and suburban expansion was critical enough that they had to violate that unspoken rule. And yes, land owners made the same argument, but a combination of ex-gratis payments/benefits combined with pretty clear explanations on why the land had to be acquired alleviated the bulk of concerns - and the land acquired was rapidly tranformed into high density housing to reduce the pressures of the gigantic population density of the city centre. There was no erosion of trust then because there was a clear demonstration of the need for the plantations and smaller farms to be cleared to make way for better land utilisation.

The thing with the golf courses in the 90s? It's nowhere near as critical as the development of the 70s and 80s.

Instead of looking at my comment in vacuo, let me quote the initial comment that I was trying to respond to:

 ""The government could've just invalidated the leases and evicted the clubs. *Terrible*  idea, because **not only would this not stand up in court, but if the  govt succeeded and the court backed it, it would set a VERY BAD  precedent of the govt being able to take back any land if they so  desired. Which means houses or other pieces of land would be worthless  since the govt can just arbitrarily evict you for their own reasons. No  developer would want to take the risk of building anything if they risk  not being able to recoup the costs.""**

This was what I'm responding to. The claim there is that the government absolutely and categorically cannot compulsorily acquire land because it's terrible for developer confidence, and would set a bad precedent. He is giving the impression that (1) compulsory acquisition is illegal and courts will not back it up (which is just false) and (2) this will somehow set a ""precedent"" even though compulsory acquisition has a long history in Singapore and is fairly routine, often with valuation that is drastically lower than that expected by the landowner. 

This article gives a brief overview of the differences in valuation (as you can see the differences can be quite big):

> Besides Clementi forest, another piece of forested land is also slated for residential development.

> The patch, which is south of the Clementi forest, is called the Dover forest. It is also known as the Ulu Pandan estate.

> Unlike the Clementi forest, the Dover forest is likely to be replaced by new flats in the coming years.

> Environmentalists in Singapore hope more people will look at the environmental baseline study and speak up for the forest.

> Untouched for about 40 years

> According to the environmental baseline study released by the Housing Development Board (HDB), the Dover forest was part of rubber plantation from the 1920s to the 1940s, and was abandoned after World War II.

> Since the 1980s, the patch, with four freshwater streams, has been relatively untouched.

> About half of the land area of the forest is made up of secondary forest that regrew from what used to be plantations or kampungs.

> The patch is approximately 33 hectares (about the size of 46 soccer fields) and has a steep terrain of about 10m from Commonwealth Avenue West towards Ulu Pandan canal.

> Here are some photos of the said Dover forest:

> A precious and rare patch of wilderness: Dover resident

> Yee Hui Tan, a Dover resident of six years, told Mothership that she would be very sad to lose this patch of green space.

> Tan described the green space as ""a precious and rare patch of wilderness"".

> She said that she appreciates the tranquillity, fresh air and interesting wildlife that can be sighted from the park connector due to the Dover forest.

> She acknowledges that having this huge forest in the area a luxury but it is also what makes the neighbourhood as valuable as it is.

> Another Dover resident Sydney Cheong told Mothership that after the late 1990s, changes in the estate were rampant with the development of condominiums, multi-storey car parks, and the Ghim Moh Link estate.

> The long-time resident who moved to the estate 44 years ago said that when he runs or walks next to the forest, it has a ""cooling effect"" (especially on warm days).

> The former science teacher has also seen an abundance of plants and animals, such as raptors, giant spiders, and wild flowers.

> He said, ""It is a loss to the natural heritage and biodiversity of Singapore if a forest of this statue is destroyed and cleared.""

> In a bid to save the forest, Cheong has since conducted surveys with residents and started an online petition to rally support. At least 35 residents living near the forest told Cheong that they want to keep the forest too.

> Unprotected and designated for residential development

> According to the Straits Times, HDB unveiled that it will be offering new flats in the Ulu Pandan estate this year.

> HDB has also published an environmental baseline study on the Dover forest.

> HDB said on its website that the study allows for the agency to ""sensitively plan the land use and make adjustments to the Master Plan if needed to mitigate the potential impact"".

> The environment baseline study was conducted for the area as outlined in red below:

> The study aims to provide information on the existing diversity and distribution of flora and fauna as well as to characterise the hydrologic conditions in the Dover forest.

> A sanctuary for endangered wildlife

> According to the environmental baseline study conducted in 2017 by HDB, 120 species of plants and 158 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, snails, and insects were observed in Dover Forest.

> Here are some observations from the environmental baseline study:

> Around 45 per cent of the vegetation in the Dover forest has been classified as ""Good"" or ""Very Good"". 16 locally threatened species of plants and 27 large trees of significance were identified. Discovery of a Critically Endangered Ficus virens, a mature tree from the fig family which is approximately 11m wide (including prop roots). Figs are important species of plants that provide food all year round for a large variety of animals. 82 birds, eight mammals, 11 reptiles, eight amphibians, four fish, 23 butterflies and 17 odonates, as well as five snail species. Seven endangered bird species were observed (Glossy Swiftlet, Changeable Hawk-Eagle, Blue-crowned Hanging Parrot, Violet Cuckoo, Oriental Magpie Robin, Asian Softshell Turtle).

> Here are some wildlife that can be found in Dover forest:

> An uncommon forest bird species, the Changeable Hawk Eagle, was also observed to have used the Dover forest as a nesting site:

> The report also showed that the forest patch could be remediating rainwater (or naturally treating water) which eventually flows into Pandan Reservoir.

> Furthermore, after the report was submitted in 2017, a critically-endangered bird species, the straw-headed bulbul was heard in the forest in December 2020, a final year Environmental Studies undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Elliott James Ong told Mothership.

> He shared that while naturalists did not capture a photo of the bird, they heard its distinct call in Dover forest.

> If you are curious, this is what a straw-headed bulbul looks like (photo not taken at Dover forest):

> Singapore is currently one of the strongholds of this species.

> The 573 individuals found in Singapore here were reported to possibly make up more than half of the global wild population, the Straits Times reported last year.

> More than just a safe haven for wildlife

> Beyond providing a safe haven for wild plants and animals, the Dover forest plays a role in other natural processes.

> A spokesperson for Speak for Climate, a ground-up initiative that aims to improve public participation on climate change-related issues, said that green spaces such as Dover forest can act as carbon sink.

> Forests also help to soak up excess rainwater, mitigate soil and slope erosion due to solid root structures helping to hold the soil together.

> Adding on to that, forests have been proven to have positive benefits on our wellbeing, such as reducing stress and improving recovery from physical and mental illnesses, said the spokesperson from Speak for Climate.

> As the western end of Dover forest is connected to the larger Clementi Forest, clearing the forest could lead to further forest fragmentation and possibly increased human-wildlife conflicts as animals are displaced from their habitats, said the spokesperson from Speak for Climate.

> Dover forest vital to wildlife in South-Central Singapore: NSS

> Speaking to Mothership, the President of Nature Society (Singapore) (NSS) Shawn Lum said that the size and strategic location of Dover forest contribute to the survival and resilience of forest and wildlife found in south-central Singapore.

> In a regional context, the Dover Forest takes on added importance, said Lum.

> He explained that the forest is surrounded by several significant wildlife habitats and forested areas such as the Rail Corridor, Clementi Woods, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, secondary forests in Bukit Batok, and Kent Ridge.

> Here's how Dover forest is connected to Clementi Forest, and ultimately to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, according to environmentalist Jimmy Tan:

> Lum added:

> ""The forests of this key biodiversity region of the island are under pressure for owing to their development potential and their prime location (for people as well as for wildlife).""

> The President of NSS also highlighted that Dover forest has great potential for educational and recreational use given its proximity to other HDB estates and educational institutions, including School of Science and Technology and Singapore Polytechnic.

> Proposals for Dover forest from environmentalists

> Along with the environmental baseline study, HDB has also provided an avenue for the public to provide feedback on the development.

> Ong and Cheong suggest turning Dover forest into a nature park or to at least preserve old and tall trees that could qualify as heritage trees.

> Heritage trees are trees with a girth of more than five metres and/or with botanical, social, historical, cultural and/or aesthetical value.

> The duo also proposed alternative development sites, such as the huge open fields such as former Dover Road estate (opposite NUH), the abandoned Warren Golf club, and the field next to Ulu Pandan community centre.

> If you are interested, you can provide your feedback to HDB before the window closes on Jan. 16, 2021.

> Striking a balance

> Balancing the needs for development and conservation in a land-scarce Singapore will increasingly be challenging.

> The key to spare more green spaces from development lies in better urban planning, according to Tay Kheng Soon, an Adjunct Professor from the Department of Architecture at NUS told Mothership.

> Tay proposes to have multilevel multifunction compact designs for infrastructure to save on land.

> He explained this would mean looking at mixed land use, which would feature building upwards with schools, workplaces, social spaces and shops in the same space.

> The idea of a compact city is not a new one.

> It is touted as part of sustainable development, with core strategies such as high-density, sustainable transportation, and the presence of green spaces.

> One example of such a city is Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

> Tay also highlighted that this compact design could transform Singapore over the next 30 years as having more green spaces around clustered dwellings can lead to a green web being linked together across the island.

Its even worse enough where HDB refuses to do due diligence checks on Chinese Contractors coming to Singapore to build a 100+m building. Cheapest always wins. 

Basically process goes like this, Singaporean makes a deal with a chinese contractor in China to come to Singapore to build an HDB. Once all is agreed that singaporean tenders out to HDB project under his SME company and with the Chinese contractors qualifications. Lowest price wins. Chinese contractors mobilizes and builds their building then heads back to China rinse and repeat. 

You can find various projects on Gebiz like that where you have a random unknown SME that wins a 100+m project thats registered to some condo/terrace/hdb flat with no background and the difference in pricing between the normalized competitors and the cheapest is quite large. 

A lot of these contractors in China are massive so even if it they make a loss on the project in Singapore but it will still fall into their global KPI and make up for it in China.

Dover MRT station is an elevated Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the East West line in Queenstown planning area, Singapore, located along Commonwealth Avenue West. It was the first infill station added to an existing line on the Singapore MRT network. It is also the first elevated station in Singapore with two side platforms on either side of the tracks, as opposed to having an island platform commonly found in other elevated MRT stations. A similar layout was adopted at Canberra MRT station.

And I don't think either of us has anywhere in mind when you mentioned ""ulu patches of forest with equivalent biodiversity"". Until then, it's just hypothetical and no real alternative is presented. 

I mean, I don't think anyone will disagree with you to develop the more central piece of land everything else being equal and if we absolutely have to choose. But the sentiment is that not many, if any, other places have the same richness of diversity and this is what makes this so rare and should be preserved. If indeed there are other forests that are ""similar"" we should celebrate all of them and not choose which ones to cut down. 

Without going into any further point by point rebuttal of your post, I don't think you have a sufficient grasp of what biodiversity and preserving it mean. For instance, it's not like you can cut down this forest and 50 years later, another random patch of vegetation somewhere else on the fringes of the island will develop into the same forest with ""equivalent"" biodiversity when left alone, if this is what you are implying in the edit to your earlier post. More likely they will be forced into neighbouring forests or residential areas where they could face increased competition and shortages of food or stress by human presence and loss of habitat and other factors. I don't think they just uproot themselves and move house to another corner of the island as if nothing severe has happened. This is what makes it ""unique"" or part of something unique that should be preserved as much as possible. 

Anyway, it's fine if you don't agree with me of course, and you likely will not unless you're an ""environmentalist"" that you yourself called out earlier.

sure we still have mandai, sungei buloh, ccnr and btnr. but how sure are you that the govt won't slate those plots of land for development in years to come? why not conserve what we can? 

and im here 'bitching' about a 'tiny' plot of land because yes the ecosystem of dover forest has its own functions which, if eradicated, CAN affect us big time. im putting 'tiny' in apostrophes, because tiny suggests its insignificant when its NOT. the presence of a 33ha plot of forest not only ameliorates micro-climatic effects like your urban heat island effect, it also acts as a wildlife connector to the bigger forests like clementi and btnr. why is this important? in layman terms, we simply don't want inbreeding of species in an isolated forest area. in the worst case scenario, all it takes is a single disease for the entire threatened species to be wiped out. also, clearing the forest could lead to further forest fragmentation and increased human-wildlife conflicts as animals are displaced from their habitats.

there's a lot more examples on how a 'tiny' patch of forest can affect us. mitigating soil erosion in the surrounding area, mental wellness etc, there's a lot more to it than you think. so am i really the one with a 'small-minded myopic view? *probably* not.

448,4,gjc4r3k,t1_gjbx3xs,"I will take the Simpang forest/swamp/mangrove area as an example. It was once zoned to be developed into low density housing (now, the bulk is just a reserved site). That swamp and forested area should have plenty of biodiversity, and home to land and marine animals.

Years ago, a significant part of that Simpang swamp area was zoned into low rise HDB, clearing a plot roughly the same size as this patch of forest in question. Another portion was cut out to build the new low density Canberra HDB estate.

Now, if you ask me, if there are two richly biodiverse sites, why would I want to clear far flung areas like Simpang to build low density HDB, and yet preserve a much more useful and potentially densely populated land like the Dover forest?

In contrast to that plot of land Yishun annexed/carved out to build Canberra from Simpang to build low rise HDB, the land in Dover could easily be 2 times more densely populated with massive 40 stories HDBs. The added benefit of reduced commute is the cherry on the top.

Even if the density is equivalent, preserving land like Simpang and building up Dover instead would benefit people due to commute time saving, while the overall biodiversity impact is similar (trading one biodiverse patch for another).

While it is saddening to see valuable forest gone, that Dover forest could easily save/delay the development larger areas of biodiverse sites located in ulu regions.

That’s why I asked, is this particular patch unique? If it is not unique, and given the possibility to build 30-40 stories massive HDBs, this is a trade off that *minimises* the economic impact of building houses, *while* its ideal location benefits the tens of thousands of potential HDB dwellers. There are psychological studies that found that every additional 20 minutes of commute is psychologically equivalent to taking an almost 20% paycut. The psychological impact is immense.

Singapore is a very small island. It is highly unlikely one patch of forest surrounded by development is home to unique species that cannot be found anywhere else. Other areas are also biodiverse and could be home to endangered species too! If we could reduce overall the amount of land we need to develop while simultaneously maximise satisfaction, this should be the way forward.

If this patch is *unique* in biodiversity, then fine, I will concede. But, is it actually so unique that it takes more precedence over ulu biodiverse sites?

The article is filled with *residents* complaining about the forest being cleared. To think of the bigger picture, environmentally and in terms of benefit to people, these residents are indeed selfish in asking to preserve this specific forest for their satisfaction. 

To satisfy them, we are talking about harming more forested areas and psychological toll of future HDB residents being forced to live in far fringes of the island as valuable lands are all developed.

The benefit for a *small* group of people by preserving this forest is dwarfed by the benefit for a *larger* group of people *and* benefit from delaying the development of other biodiverse sites such as my example above.

It is far more selfish to benefit the few and harm the majority and nature, than to benefit the majority and save nature, while harming the few.

If we have to develop lands for housing, I rather be the bad guy on Reddit and advocate minimising the overall harm, then be the populist guy pandering to emotions of Redditors and ignore the bigger considerations.

E: re-read the article and found that this forest is merely a “recent” forest, previously plantation land that nature has reclaimed. Contrast this to *untarnished* lands like the Simpang forest/mangrove/swamp, or even the *Tengah forest* which we have cleared to build Tengah estate, this land just don’t seem more environmentally valuable than other biodiverse land whose development this patch could delay.",t3_kxkdfz,15-01-2021

There is also value in having a green corridor right smack in the middle of civilization, case in point: Central Park in New York City. Due to these reasons alone, many will consider the forest and its biodiversity to be unique. If not, what are the considerations for being unique? 

I note that the Simpang land you described probably share more similarities (mixture of mangrove swamp and forest and all) with Chek Jawa than the Dover forest, which may be reason to consider that the Dover forest is actually more unique. Don't get me wrong — it is of course my preference that both do not get destroyed and it is also not yet conclusive to me which one should be sacrificed instead of the other. It's dependent on so many factors and not just environmental ones. For example, it is to my understanding that said Simpang land is used for certain sensitive activities.

Let this be a choice between demolishing the larger Clementi forest nearby or this Dover forest, which on a satellite map is split into *two* distinct portions with actual forested area smaller than the nearby Singapore Polytechnic, which one do you choose?

If one was to be preserved, the other will surely be destroyed or much reduced. That Clementi forest is also designated as future residential land. You can’t convince the government to keep both.

Take note that the Clementi forest is the second largest wildlife habitat after Bukit Timah nature reserve.

Would you choose to protect a smaller piece of disconnected forest or a larger contiguous piece of forest? Not only that, any residential buildings in the land now occupied by the Clementi forest is further from MRT, meaning more buses and *pollution*, on top of increased commute time.

And what do you save by saving this Dover forest over the Clementi one? Why are you so damn insistent on this one small divided patch of forest, when its sacrifice could potentially delay the destruction of other more important places of nature?

If you say Simpang is not unique because it’s like Chek Jawa, then, wouldn’t Dover forest simply be a smaller and worse version of the nearby Clementi forest?

The location right beside the MRT is perhaps the *most ideal area* to build the tallest and densest of HDBs. Its sacrifice, if fully utilised to the maximum, could delay destruction of other biodiverse areas, perhaps including the similar Clementi forest nearby!

If there is a choice between Clementi forest and Dover forest, it is a very simple choice to advocate to preserve the Clementi forest instead. 1. Dover forest has less ecological impact than the similar Clementi forest, and 2. HDBs built at Dover would benefit people more than at Clementi. It’s a non-contest.

>	and how it connects Clementi forest to Bukit Timah reserve.

Can you please take a look at the map? Why would Dover forest, located south of Clementi forest, be the connector to a forest located *north* of Clementi forest? Are the animals going to go south to Dover, u-turn, go back to Clementi, then go north to Bukit Timah?

>	What about air quality, greenery and mental wellbeing from not being surrounded by concrete.

Sure. Sending more poor people off to far flung places like Punggol to breathe the pollution rich Pasir Gudang air so that a small number of rich people could breathe “better” air is *such a good idea*. /s

>	Or, what about the benefits of staying in the far fringes, such as peace and quiet away from the bustle of city life?

It’s not like there’s a lack of ulu HDBs with peace and quiet. On the other hand, HDBs in good location isn’t that abundant. So for people who have to work long hours and the commute distance matters, what do we do about them?

If people really do care so much about the “peace and quiet”, why is it that houses far flung “peaceful” region are far less sought after and worth much less?

>	greenery

One can walk in the park, one don’t usually wander into the forest. To a person, the greenery in a park is far more relevant than a forest. One don’t *immerse* themselves in nature by walking on concrete pavements on the perimeter of a forest!

Please, we can’t save everything. We have to prioritise and choose what is more ecologically valuable and consider about maximising benefit to people.

For more information about the point I was trying to convey, and which I referred you to in the article, please refer to the heading ""Dover forest vital to wildlife in South-Central Singapore: NSS"". 

I think we will have to disagree on the value we attach to the Dover forest. I don't think you appreciate the rarity of such untouched forests as much, even if it's _only_ a secondary forest. I mean, for one, you compared a 40 year old forest to a park in the neighbourhood. I don't know about you, but people actually visit Bukit Timah reserve and other places like MacRitchie reservoir to ""immerse"" themselves in nature even if they may not stay nearby. And just in case you think, ya so just keep Bukit Timah reserve for such purpose and take away the rest, I would have you know that people also visit the quarries nearby, so it's not farfetched that they will want to step into the Clementi forest or Dover forest as well. 

Anyway, just for the record, I'm of the opinion that we should keep both Simpang and Dover forest, and that it's not meaningful to compare biodiversity between these two areas and determine which is greater and hence which should be sacrificed. I cannot agree with you advocating to chip away at our remaining forests just for the convenience of a select segment of the population. To me, we should make do with what we already have first and maximise utilisation of existing developed land before setting our sights on the remaining vestiges of nature in our country. Perhaps not to the extent of reclaiming private landed properties — the article itself already suggested alternative sites which are plain fields. 

To be honest, I really find your numerous comparisons simplistic at best which I feel lead to poorly considered decisions with long term repercussions.

_Edit: Since a significant part of your argument appears to downplay the importance of the ""one small divided patch of forest"" that is Dover forest, I would like to repeat and emphasise that its ecological importance was already mentioned in the article, and perhaps its value is disproportionate to its size or age.

>Dover is not in a good state for preservation

Afaik, you're a j2 student not specializing in environmental/biodiversity studies or anything. What makes you say this? Got source from a qualified professional?

As a matter of fact, I'll argue that it's in a good state for preservation based on its biodiversity numbers alone.

- 120 species of plants and 158 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, snails, and insects 

- Around 45 per cent of the vegetation in the Dover forest has been classified as ""Good"" or ""Very Good""

- 16 locally threatened species of plants and 27 large trees of significance 

- Critically endangered Ficus virens, a mature tree that provides food all year round for a large variety of animals

- Six locally 'critically endangered' or 'endangered' species 

>It's not even a forest, but merely an abandoned plantation

You are wrong that it's not a forest. Dover forest is grown on abandoned plantation land, and being grown on abandoned plantation land =/= it's an abandoned plantation. It's a secondary regrowth forest, specifically of the Adinandra belukar subtype. 

>It's not like you can integrate it into a nature corridor for animals which walk, at most it will be merely useful for migratory birds

Dover forest is surrounded by several significant wildlife habitats and forested areas like the rail corridor, clementi forest, btnr, and secondary forests in bukit batok and kent ridge. This connectivity is certainly exploited by animals other than migratory birds, like langurs. Also, 'merely useful for migratory birds' suggests you are unaware of how important migratory birds are. They are the ones that help control pests, pollinate your plants, and serve as food sources for other wildlife.

527,4,gn8g066,t3_lj1uzp,">Touch your heart and ask yourself, do you seriously want to live there?

The argument for your points on people not wanting to live in Tuas is odd. You are basing your assumptions on the fact that everyone goes to the CBD to work, which is clearly not the case. As you said yourself- Jurong is a heavily industrialised area, and it will become even more populated with workers in the future when the port of SG gets moved there. And the comparison of Tuas to Punggol is not justified as well. Air pollution in Punggol is a result of our neighbours to the north, not our own factories. [There are no major manufacturing plants in Singapore, meaning that a vast amount of air pollution is caused by transboundary pollution.](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/industrial/2019/11/06/is-there-industrial-pollution-in-singapore-2/) This isn't a problem with Tuas because the region of Malaysia that borders the western side of Singapore is relatively rural compared to JB and Pasir Gudang.

[Additionally, NEA constantly monitors the air around Jurong/Tuas and have found that ambieng air quality there is normal, and any weird smells are not harmful.](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/parliament-smells-emitted-from-factories-in-jurong-industrial-area-not-harmful)

I agree with you on the basis that Tanah Merah golf course is not a good place to build BTOs. But not for your basis of it being too far from the CBD. The 50000 workers at Changi Airport or the other few ten thousand people workers in the surrounding Loyang Industrial Region and Changi Biz Park would love to live in this area because it's so near. Rather, building BTOs at Tanah Merah Country Club is unviable because of one main reason. It's directly in the path of Changi Airport's runways and thus any BTO's constructed there must be super low.

528,4,gn8t928,t3_lj1uzp,"I don't know about unpopular but your opinion is premised on some really poor arguments

1) prime location does not mean ""beside MRT"". If you want to make the argument that it's prime location for housing you need to substantiate the issue better because our house racing stadium is beside kranji MRT, but not one is going to suggest we demolished the horse track to build flats because that's prime location.

2) BTO as social mobility is a joke. Proper social mobility is important and needs to occur in places like our schooling system. A lottery based ""get an expensive flat if you're lucky"" is a laughable example of social mobility, and an even worse reason to clear a forest.

3) Clearing Dover provides zero guarantees that other forests won't be cleared either so there's no casual link in the argument.

4) this assumes (wrongly) that people have to commute to work in the CBD. Jurong says hi.

5) you don't even offer this as a reason why the forest should be cleared and merely ""food for thought"". Either make an argument supporting your view, or don't.

Rebuttals:

1) PRs can buy HDB, and I think that's the group people are referring to when they complain about importing foreigners. Even then you don't address the nub of the argument which is that more people in a small island means less space for housing. Foreigners might not directly affect HDB sites but by occupying other places it limits where we can have HDB sites 

2) not everyone works in the CBD. See above.

3) this is an obvious is/ought fallacy. Sure many plots are earmarked for development but the government can easily reallocate and replan. People are discussing whether Dover SHOULD be cleared - people aren't disputing it's planning status. Not engaging with the issue.

4) you have no idea what you're talking about with en bloc - many old condominiums have been en bloc and none of them have ever been regarded as a loss of heritage. You're thinking of the exceptions (like golden mile) rather than the rule.

5) utterly bizzare argument - the same logic means that we should start clearing bits of Mac Ritchie and building housing near there so more people can enjoy the cooling effect.",t3_lj1uzp,13-02-2021
529,4,gn8vo2h,t3_lj1uzp," I am generally a lurker on Reddit, but when I saw the amount of false assumptions and logical leaps I just couldn't help but pen a response.  


1. Just because its a prime location for housing doesn't diminish its ecological value. I would like to also point out that a HDB environmental baseline study found that ""Dover Forest is home to at least 158 species of animals - including critically endangered ones - and 120 plant species"", thus making it a 'prime location' for conservation. Please consider its ecological value (along with its potential landuse/housing value) before committing to a decision to clear the forest.  


2. I have asked my conscience, and it told me that a housing ballot is not the best way to promote social mobility. Targeted measures for lower income groups such as HDB grants and subsidies are a much better way. It is wishful thinking to assume that the lower income groups will magically be able to ballot successfully for these hypothetically highly popular housing flats, given the huge demand by non-lower income groups and even the more well to do demographics. Also, by extension of your logic, Toto/4D is a magic bullet for social mobility (ask your conscience if this is right).  


3. Conservation of forests is non-mutually exclusive. Conserving Dover Forest will not necessarily cause Clementi Forest to be cleared (although I admit it may have some influence), or vice versa. We can both care about Dover Forest and Clementi Forest, as well as Tengah, or any other area of ecological and conservation value. If you keep plucking the lowest hanging fruit you will eventually have a fruitless tree.  


4. I'm glad that you are trying to apply your understanding of physics and the principle of conservation of energy, but it is not as simple as that. Did you conduct a study on the travel patterns of the demography of Dover? Did you consider the proximity of their workplaces (and the potential Jurong CBD)? Did you conduct a quantitative study on how much in terms of energy costs you would save by building BTO in Dover as opposed to Tengah/Tuas, and whether this amount would be significant enough to offset the non-tangible value of ecological services and residents' perceived value of green spaces? Without these, you cannot definitively conclude that ""saving this forest causes more long term pollution through commutes"".  


I propose a simple thought experiment: assuming the trains run on a constant schedule, how much energy/transport costs do you save if you board the train at Dover instead of Pioneer, given that your destination is Raffles Place?  


5. I don't know enough about the property market to comment on whether or not the value of private homes in the area will be depressed over time. It is plausible, but then again I think it is idealistic to assume that developing HDBs in that area will build social cohesion and  dismantle the elite enclave.

530,4,gnaci6s,t3_lj1uzp,">**1. Why don't we stop importing foreigners?**  
>  
>First of all, if I'm not wrong, purely foreign households cannot buy HDBs, so stopping the import of foreigners isn't going to make any difference in this case. Maids live with Singaporean households, and foreign workers live in dormitories. So they aren't exactly contributing to the spike in the domestic public housing demand, are they? **(Mic drop)**

This is absolutely incorrect. Foreigners do contribute to demand for public housing. Let me explain why.

Firstly, not all foreign workers live in dormitories. We have roughly 1.7 million non-residents living in Singapore and only about 300k people living in dormitories. Obviously, most foreigners (workers, students and dependents) do NOT live in dormitories even if you take away the foreign domestic workers (around 230k). So, the remaining million or so non-residents living in Singapore have to live somewhere. Even if they cannot buy HDB units, they do contribute to the **demand** for it.

Secondly, whole HDB flats can rented out to foreigners. In fact, HDB's [own statistics](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/renting-out-a-flat-bedroom/renting-out-your-flat/rental-statistics) do show that the number of whole HDB units rented out increased from 15,137 in 2009 to 48,195 in 2019, **more than tripling over the last decade**. The implications for this are that there are almost 50k Singapore households who no longer live in the public housing but hold onto their flat to earn rental income while living elsewhere. This means that there are 50k possible **spare** units that could have been released to the HDB resale market but the owners (who, may I remind you, are already living elsewhere) have not decided to sell them because they are subletted out, most likely to foreign workers or students. In effect, these HDB units are used as **investment properties** and the owners are acting as **landlords**.

If you restrict whole HDB units from being subletted or reduce the number of units leased out, you reduce the demand for HDB units for use as an investment property. The owners/landlords are likely to sell them away and increase the supply of HDB units on the resale market market, lowering their resale price and making them more affordable to resident buyers (citizens and PRs). One way to reduce the demand for HDB flats as investment properties is to do something about Singapore's non-resident population.

>Many people do like the lottery effect, which such rare BTOs provides, for it is the only easy shot for such lower-income people to achieve social mobility.

This assumption that lower-income people go for BTOs in mature estates is... highly questionable. BTO units in mature estates are priced substantially higher than your average BTO in a non-mature estate, usually beyond the reach of ""lower-income people"".",t3_lj1uzp,13-02-2021
531,4,gn8ekn0,t3_lj1uzp,"I’ve addressed the masterplan before. There are numerous plots of land in equally prime areas in the vicinity but they remain empty for almost a decade. No matter how hard you try to justify the reasons that we need space for housing, it doesn’t address the fact that these plots of land have been empty, unused for years. 

Sure they are planned for housing. That’s the keyword. It’s only planned on paper and nothing more. One of them has even been reallocated from residence to become an expansion for an industrial park. This means that there are no solid plans for residential use at all. It’s merely an earmark. (If you deal with HDB and other agencies you’ll find this is a common practice - announce first, plan in detail later, in this case even a decade later nothing is planned) So the question now is: if you tear down a forest while there’s still available land, which do you use first? The vacant land while your forest is destroyed? Or use the forested land while other land remains vacant? Either way you spin it, it will all come back to saying that there is _no urgent need_ for the land to be repurposed for residences. That has been the core reason of this debate. If we really need housing spaces that badly, sure take the forest down. But if you take time to understand how the government agencies work and pay attention to the deeper details, you’ll see it’s not the case. 

“We need them for emergencies like covid temporary dorms”

Yes and no. We can see from the covid response already, not a single one of the plots of land in the vicinity were used. Instead they look towards large exhibition areas, vacated HDB blocks that haven’t been torn down yet, etc because it’s cheaper to repurpose them. And if this argument is true, we should just open up a new category “emergency use” instead of allocating it for residences. Because we have to be prepare for emergency all the time right?

This is a rather huge claim. Social mobility is really a huge issue. Having a bunch of new houses from establishing new residential estates will influence that is really questionable.

And simply owning a good value house doesn't necessarily mean one can move up the social strata. There are so many unpredictable factors at play to lead to that eventual conclusion that without any substantiation, one would not be readily convinced.

>**Saving this forest destroys other forests**

One forest is not necessarily mutual exclusive to another.

Developmental plans are specific to site conditions, such as topography, soil types and stability, nearby infrastructure, height restrictions, GPR etc. All of these might not be the same at another site and hence a certain kind of development might not be suitable elsewhere. This claim might be true for some, but to generalize it for all forests is again, a very huge claim.

Both this and other forests could be destroyed, or both could be preserved, the fate of one isn't always dependent on the fate of another.

>**Saving this forest causes more long term pollution through commutes.**

Firstly, not all people work in CBD. Secondly, the trains and buses will run regardless of whether some people from an estate use them or not. Lastly, how significant is having a new estate on the general commuting patterns islandwide?

Looking at the above,  I would say maybe your claim is valid, but most probably not significant   at all to be considered a benefit.

>**Preserving this forest benefits the wealthy; destroying it reduces class segregation.**

Again, this sounds like a really huge claim. I don't deny that this could be a rich problem, an opposite of the NIMBY problem, but you are creating a false 'us vs them' argument here.

Is it really only the wealthy benefitting? There are also not so wealthy people living near. To what extent can one curb class segregation simply with establishing a new estate?

>**Environmental and heritage conservation, they are often in conflict with each other.**

That's a false dichotomy. Environmental and heritage conservation can always come hand in hand. It is highly context dependent, on what kind of environment impacts and what kind of heritage.

For example, Botanical Gardens. One could argue that heritage is preserved through the preservation of certain trees and historical elements, while the environment is also conserved because well, it became a park.

>By destroying a part of the forest, you maximize the number of Singaporeans who can enjoy the lowered temperatures that the forest's remaining sections provide.

I'm afraid that's not how Urban Heat Island works.

With reduced forest size, the capacity to absorb heat by the forest is greatly reduced. And also now on the original forested land, you have concrete which traps way more heat than any other natural material. So would the forest's remaining sections really still provide lower temperatures to the surrounding? I highly doubt so.

The answer probably is a “no”. While Dover serves as extra space for those wildlife and it’s loss is lamentable, it is very different from the false dichotomy that you have presented, that the loss of Dover will result in the loss of all those endangered wildlife.

If those wildlife are found in Dover, it is likely also to be found in other forested areas connected to the Bukit Timah nature reserves, and they too would contain these critical wildlife. If so, here comes the question:

If you look at the URA masterplan, large portions of  forested areas adjacent or nearby to the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is drawn as residential land or reserved for development. The area being explicitly marked for development dwarfs Dover forest’s size, yet I don’t see anyone getting as agitated in wanting those areas to be preserved.

Firstly, from a cursory observation of the forest, I can tell that it is split in 2, by a covered human walkway for the rich people up north. The forest is already fragmented, and the eastern portion is really tiny. I’m not sure how capable is it in sustaining a decent animal population. If it is not able the sustain it, then there isn’t much fauna worth preserving, and Dover forest should be destroyed. If it is able to sustain it, then the animals living in the east side should be capable of making do with what remains in the western section.

Secondly, what you mention of animals other than migratory birds making use of the forest connectivity, that concerns me. From what I know, there aren’t any eco links that bridges the forests together like the one along BKE. And I don’t think animals are smart enough to make use of overhead bridges. I may be wrong, monkeys can be pretty smart. But if those animals do make use of the connectivity, wouldn’t there be a lot of roadkills between the forests by now?

And now, last point on urban heat island effect. That would be an argument for saving bigger forests like Tengah, Simpang, or even Clementi over Dover, since bigger = better. Dover doesn’t really have a lot of depth to it.

587,4,gnbtnal,t1_gn8t928,"Hi. Some of the arguments are much stronger than the other. Especially the one on transport. Let me address your concerns.

1) I will define prime location to be a location which holds a certain level of convenience and prestige that most Singaporeans do not get to reside in. Generally, that means that while there may be other prime locations that aren’t near MRT stations, those which are near MRT stations and aren’t on the far ends of Singapore are prime locations. Dover is a prime location. You have exclusive landed properties up north affording a certain level of prestige, and easy connectivity to the city down south.

2) BTO as social mobility is indeed a joke. But as flawed as it is, it is still a mode of social mobility. If we have less of this, we must not forget to have more of something else. Lower-income people stand to have a chance to benefit from it. By the way, in this case I define lower-income people very broadly, it is people who cannot afford landed properties. This includes middle-income households living in 5-room HDBs or small condominium apartments. Maybe I should have cleared the miscommunication out. Those people would be relatively poor compared to those owning freehold landed properties.

3) Clearing Dover forest provides zero guarantees but it provides more reasons to support whatever that is left. If we try to conserve everything, we will end up conserving nothing. The government will just proceed to chop the remaining trees and ignore the pleas because there’s no sense of which to prioritise and which to not.

4) Even if we assume that people work elsewhere, like one-north, Ubi, Paya Lebar, or Jurong East, the effect of the commutes average out such that an average commute from Dover is shorter than that in say Tengah. Of course, people tend to live closer to where they work. But that’s not always the case. There are people whose workplace is in the wrong end of Singapore, in relation to their place of residence. And for those kind of people, living closer to the CBD or Circle Line is beneficial to them.

5) It is all the more a reason to support the destruction of Dover forest because the rich benefits more from its preservation. And society stands to benefit from less class segregation if a more diverse class of people live there.

Now to the second part.

1) In that case then I’m sorry that many Singaporeans with a foreigner/PR parent like me are to be blamed for being not true-blue enough.

2) The argument still applies even if not everyone works in the CBD. See above.

3) I guess you have a point? But still, we know that it will eventually happen.

4) If you consider them to be exceptions, then man there are plenty of exceptions to make. Commonwealth. West Coast. Circuit Road. Tiong Bahru. Clementi. Toa Payoh. Boon Keng. Each has its own story, and hold memories to many. En-bloc destroys entire communities and causes a cultural genocide, especially when it comes to HDBs.

5) To determine whether this argument is bizarre or not I will need to ask you the minimum forest size where there is still a significant urban heat island effect on the surroundings. If it is larger than Dover forest, then that’s not a reason to preserve Dover forest. If it is smaller than Dover forest, it is justification to axe certain parts of the forest to maximise the amount of people who can benefit from such an effect.",t3_lj1uzp,14-02-2021
588,4,gnbk0hk,t1_gn8vo2h,"Good point. You aren’t completely wrong. Just want to ask a few questions regarding your points. Not as a skeptic, just genuine questions.

1. Do you know what kind of animals are in there? I’ve been searching high and low on Google, and I can’t find any details about that.

2. Not wrong, there are better ways for social mobility. BTO is just one of them. Though we have less of this, we better remember to have more of something else. Otherwise social mobility might tank.

3. True. I’m just not very confident that public opinion will push for both forests preservation. If Dover is preserved to much fanfare while Clementi is destroyed as nobody is looking, that would be insult to injury.

4. The truth is, I don’t have an answer to that. But I can speak in terms of probability. The probability that a workplace (even if it is not a CBD) is nearer to a person is pretty high in Dover than in Tengah, in terms of travelling time. Perhaps Tuas will be closer to Tengah than Dover. But one-north, Ubi, Jurong East, and Tampines will be closer to Dover than Tengah. Perhaps not by a lot, but by some. You will need more fuel to get to those places by car. Of course it’s worth noting that if you work in Pasir Ris it’s unlikely that you choose to live in Dover. But those kind of commutes do exist, and one can look at the LTA Datamall API for such details.

5. You can try looking at a few places about URA prices, as I did last time when I was discussing the issue with some Redditors. They think that the prices will increase as you are now nearer to amenities. But well, it does actually either stagnate or decrease. I don’t think building poor people houses next to rich people houses will be the silver bullet which dismantle the elite enclave. But it helps to a certain degree.

596,4,gnapydj,t1_gn8eldf,the Ficus can be transplanted. Dover is objectively a shitty forest compared to Bukit Timah or even buffer parks like Thompson or Chestnut which show some forest succession in certain areas. Dover is entirely dominated by rubber (an exotic) and birds are a poor indicator of ecosystem health as they can fly wherever they please based on what conditons suit them. Reptiles and amphibians have very limited mobility and their presence/absence is a more accurate indicator of ecosystem health. And Dover Forest's herp diversity is very poor. A small patch of old rubber plantation exposed to noise and heat from outside will have very poor microhabitats and thus low diversiry of anything that isn't a bird.

598,4,gn8r8l8,t1_gn8eldf,"OP mentioned that this plot will be well utilised if demolished. I agree with that point, with the following added reasons:

1.	You can build massive tall HDBs at Dover, given the lack of height restriction in that area and proximity to HDB, maximising residents per unit area.
2.	By doing point 1, this is the most effective use of land that we have to destroy anyway. As the OP said, would anyone want to live in ulu areas occupied by the golf courses? And are golf courses totally useless? Who knows if there are rich billionaires (whom Singapore have been trying to attract) that happen to be massive golf fans?
3.	If Dover is preserved, the immediate land issue is not resolved and the HDB will simply find another plot away from the limelight to demolish. And this time, that plot will be further away from MRT and might possibly be in a height restricted zone, forcing HDB to demolish a larger forested area to house the same amount of people. Is that a better option for nature?

In the long run, yes, we should cut down less and try to repurpose land with high utility value for housing, such as *cutting down the huge area covered by landed properties*! But in the short term, it is inevitable to cut down forests and the focus should be to minimise its impact.

All that has been cited are vague assertions of commuter flows, throwing in words like “2nd CBD” or “people working in Tuas”. How many additional passengers have to travel how many more kilometres further or less? That hasn’t been discussed. And until more studies on that is done, such concerns are valid and it would be ludicrous to say it is nonsense.

612,4,gni6m2q,t1_gni3pfz,"Hello, thanks for your input. I would say that what you have said is pretty reasonable, hence I agree with you in most parts.

At this point in time though, my last fear is that the public is paying too much attention on one tiny plot of forest, to the point that everywhere else appears neglected and not rigorously discussed, on whether they have the same, less, or more value when it comes to preservation. After all, it’s just difficult to focus on many plots at once. While the spotlight is on Dover which hasn’t even started deforestation, we have deforestation on Tengah, Gali Batu, Kranji, Lentor, Yishun, Punggol, Tampines North, Bedok South, Lim Chu Kang, et cetera. Indeed those places have been irrevocably changed and will never turn into what it used to be again. But there’s still places which shouldn’t be taken for granted, like Simpang. And we know that many of those parcels of land falls near an airbase, and will not be utilised to the same degree as if Dover is used instead, given lower gross plot ratios.

That’s where I’m coming from when I say, “saving a forest destroys another forest”. Not that it’s mutually exclusive, but that the public has a really small attention span, and concentrating too much or tunnel-visioning on one forest when there are other bigger, more ecologically and environmentally useful ones out there being neglected and secretly demolished, won’t help to combat climate change in the most optimal manner.

633,4,gn9az7x,t1_gn8udlw,"While the biodiversity may not be unique to Dover, the very definition of a (critically) endangered species is one that is 'considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild.' Surely that means we should try to conserve each and every single individual of that species? These species are already at risk of extinction - which is all the more reason why we should ensure its diversification in locations, by maintaining its numbers/presence in dover. We don't want a situation where we have all of our endangered species concentrated in one or two locations, like the nature reserves. Not only does it severely limit the gene pool and promote inbreeding, once a disease strikes, that's it for the species. So yes, I daresay that the loss of Dover may *potentially* result in the loss of the endangered species.

You might say to just relocate the endangered wildlife to other forested areas. Well yes, but how sure are you that the animals will be able to adapt, reproduce, and thrive successfully in their new habitat? And again, this links back to my point abt diversification of gene pool by having the species be spread across various territories.

>The area being explicitly marked for development dwarfs Dover forest’s size, yet I don’t see anyone getting as agitated in wanting those areas to be preserved.

Simple reason, there wasn't the media hype, wasn't reported in mainstream media outlets. I believe the Dover forest issue blew up only after mothership did an article on the petition, correct me if I'm wrong. Admittedly aside from people jumping on the bandwagon, there are also people who care just enough about conservation to defend Dover forest, but not enough to find out abt other issues that's not reported as widely. I can say in all honesty that I'm the latter, so I wasn't aware of this before you pointed it out. Still, it's a step forward in awareness.

>And by preserving Dover, we increase the pressure to demolish and develop those plots. Is it really a better option?

The problem is not this or that patch of nature.

Human (over)population is the problem.

Also, the critically endangered species already exist in tiny numbers, and loss of them would realistically result in negligible impact.

But as to your first point, the forest serves as a breeding site for the locally threatened changeable hawk eagle, as well as a habitat for long-tailed parakeets (IUCN Vulnerable) and straw headed bulbuls (Critically endangered). It also serves as a stopover point for migratory birds on the East-Asian Australasian Flyway, according to the NSS, meaning it's important for allowing raptors like sparrowhawks as well as smaller passerine birds a place to recover after a fairly arduous journey.

The flora found there isn't too commin either.

656,4,gnibhnw,t1_gni6m2q,"> public is paying too much attention on one tiny plot of forest, to the point that everywhere else appears neglected and not rigorously discussed, on whether they have the same, less, or more value when it comes to preservation. 

Well yes I do agree with that. In fact, as some other commenters have mentioned, this is , at least to a certain degree, the result of the bandwagon effect. 

The disproportionate amount of attention on this specific plot, which undeniably has relatively less value compared to other forests, made this whole 'conservation' thing very questionable. Not that there are no environmentalists out there truly concerned, but how many amongst all those who commented truly care about nature? 

Then again, it's not necessarily a bad thing. More attention on one can bring people's attention to the wider topic and other areas (hopefully), and spark debates and discussions, which is evident here in this thread of yours. 

>  That’s where I’m coming from when I say, “saving a forest destroys another forest”. Not that it’s mutually exclusive, but that the public has a really small attention span, and concentrating too much or tunnel-visioning on one forest when there are other bigger, more ecologically and environmentally useful ones out there being neglected and secretly demolished, won’t help to combat climate change in the most optimal manner 

I see. Indeed. With land scarcity around, choices are really limited. The balance between development and conservation is very intricate, and people are spending their whole lives dedicated to it. Maybe it's possible to have no forests cleared in Singapore from now on, but the costs, the impacts, the price of alternative solutions, are we capable of handling them? 

Urban planning, which could also include the public transport planning which you are interested in, is really complex. More often than not, it's about trade-offs, sacrifices, compromises. Everything comes at a cost. Ultimately, the discussion should not be simply about how bad one decision is, but rather, what are the pros and cons of this decision versus another, what is the value of this land use versus another. Truth is, nothing is truly equal in this world, somethings naturally have higher value than another. 

Yes there is irreplaceable value in a secondary forest, but how does it compare with a primary forest?  Yes the land can be left as it is and develop somewhere else, but how does it compare with developing here instead?

Asian softshell turtles may even be someone's unwanted pet. If destroying Dover forest means less encroachment on nature reserves, it is a sacrifice we have to take. The ideal scenario of course is no more encroachment anywhere from now on and instead a focus on forest succession (Dover, being part of the nutirent poor Southern Ridges and an abandoned rubber plantation, can never succeed into a mature secondary forest like in the CCNR and will instead become Adinandra belukar forest like in Kent Ridge) and connectivity (even so, Dover's position barely connects it to anywhere given the relatively poor biodiversity of the Southern Ridges) but let's be real URA would never let that happen.",t3_lj1uzp,14-02-2021

There are some basis, otherwise I wouldn’t be quoting sources here and there in the main passage. Anyways, with regards to my opinion on transportation, my stand is derived from what I observed in a few datasets from the LTA Datamall API a couple of years back. People who live further away from the city commute further, on average. Did some basic calculations with the carbon footprint of an average public bus, train or private cars and how many big trees there are in Dover with Google Maps. The data is probably fairly inaccurate, but the numbers doesn’t look very good for me. I don’t have the resources myself, but it is what it is.

Anyways, it is easy to disprove a point. It can be difficult to prove a point to the point where there is no way to rebut at all. That I agree. Otherwise, we won’t have people who have to spend their lives in fields like geography and urban environment. That’s why when I see opinions of biologists and urban planners in here, I take their opinions much more seriously. Because they know a lot more things that I don’t.

Also, the last paragraph is a terrible misrepresentation of what this unpopular opinion is for. It is a straw man argument. There is no way for me to argue logically with that. So I won’t.

To me personally, once you refer to the lottery of getting a BTO, I feel you immediately lose credibility. There is a supposed backlog of applications for BTOs. Why would Dover magically solve this? It hinges on the idea that some people will get it and thereby become enriched because they can sell for a lot after MOP is done.

But that isn’t social mobility. It’s literally a lottery. You have no way to ensure that the BTOs will go to those that actually need it. Also, those really poor? They actually can’t afford BTOs. So you’re still ignoring that subset. What you’re actually trying to promote is a lottery for the middle class. 

Have you even been to the area? If you see the responses about the large plot of land in Ghim Moh, I know exactly where that is. Why would you want another large forest to be torn down and become a literal field? 

And this idea of everyone wanting to live centrally is also flawed because not everyone works in the city centre. I know a doctor couple that loves living in Upper Bukit Timah (so not the expensive part) because their clinic they work at is in the west. That also applies to other people who work in the West.

750,4,glpfcrv,t3_lanej6,"There was uproar over Tengah. There was a long debate about Bukit Brown. There were many groups calling for the CRL to not be built.

The reasons why Dover Forest is being hotly contested varies in nature. One could say this is the first major 'clearing' planned following a landmark general election, where climate change was a notable factor in many party's manifestos. Having just been involved in a democratic process with climate action as a deciding factor, many groups are calling for promises to be kept with regards to that.

Another is that, compared to the past, civil society groups have mobilized to significant enough mass to educate, inform and gather public opinion on Dover Forest. Since the first SG Climate Rally back in 2019, there are multiple civil society groups and independent media focused on climate action. Even state-led media has helped promote these civil society groups, so it's understandable that such a push for change happens now.

Lastly, the government made a step to *open itself to feedback*, publishing a whole-ass report, releasing a public feedback form and opening itself to public scrutiny. This has essentially removed forms of ""chilling effects"" that have paralyzed certain groups from launching publicity campaigns due to fear of government intervention or shutdown, and allows for an open channel of communication.

Yes, this is an infinitesimally small patch of land compared to Tengah (**or other land parcels zoned to be cleared, just look at Lorong Halus**), and yes, your argument on class holds value indeed, especially with the centrality of the location, which civil society groups do need to examine on *why* the focus on Dover. But there's been uproar over forested/natural areas before. Some, like Senoko, Tengah and Marina South, have been cleared. Others, like Chek Jawa, have been preserved. The uproar now isn't a one-off thing. It's just intensified lately, and there's more than one factor as to why.

And you make some interesting points, especially on detachment from class and environmental groups. Some groups are exploring this AFAIK (like SG Climate Rally vouching for 'just transitions'), but it's still interesting to see the general detachment.",t3_lanej6,02-02-2021
751,4,glp5f74,t3_lanej6,"OP, I live in that area, did attend Fairfield, and trust me. Some may be because of NIMBY syndrome, but as an architecture graduate who has done landscape studios, the reason dover forest + clementi forest > tengah, as sad as tengah was, is because of the idea of a green spine that stretches across sg, while tengah was at one end of the green spine. Ideally you’d wanna connect all these pockets of green, through developments that carve out spaces to support green but not in a manicured way, but let that green overgrow kinda way. And that’s why a lot of backlash is against the development of the forest. Also I agree though that viewing it as golf course/paya airbase is very myopic, people need to start viewing it from the bigger picture really than to just say USE GOLF COURSE!!!

You have to consider accessibility, amenities and necessities etc. Building residential blocks in the middle of nowhere like at a golf course would require much more developments to be build. Food, schools and transport have to be planned out properly. That's why when ulu areas like Punggol and Tengah were/are developed, the scale is much larger than a few hdb blocks. A whole town has to be planned out carefully so that the residents there have a certain level of QOL.

Also if you carelessly build a new residential development in ""that empty space beside your house"", the demands of the new residents can overflow into the surrounding areas. That's to say there will be higher demand for schools nearby, more crowded eateries and malls, slower traffic etc.",t3_lanej6,02-02-2021

754,4,glp9h4r,t3_lanej6,"My beef is more environmental. I don’t live near that area nor have a stake in the developments there. But I do recognize that even small pockets of greenery can help support our diverse wildlife. Saying “where were you and your environmentalist arguments when they tore down tengah forest??!!” is besides the point because now we are talking about Dover forest, a forest we can still save, not tengah, a forest that is already on its way out. 

My other beef is that there are other plots of land in the area that can support the building of new houses for the growing population. Places like the large field opposite ghim moh market, the even larger field at Tanglin halt near commonwealth mrt and the field opposite Fairfield Methodist. These fields have been cleared for years, almost a decade. They’ve been left empty since. No plans have been made for them to be developed yet, other than being zoned as residential in the master plan. And even That means jack shit because the Fairfield lot was zoned for residential for years and now it’s been dezoned to become “subjected to further planning” with no explanation (best guess is to reserve land for fusionopolis expansion but it’s really anyone’s guess at this point). In other words, if they can change after years of being zoned for residential, then there are no real plans in place in the first place. I find this to be similar for other HDB projects as well, like the NRP at my house, announced 2 years ago and we even voted for the project with “artists impressions” made. Made it seem like everything was already drawn up but when I asked the town council and HDB for detailed plans, they say they haven’t reach that stage yet, all still in approval stage. Two years, still no solid plans. 

So coming back to Dover forest - are we going to tear it down just to let it sit dormant while we work on the three big plots of land (which can hold up to five to six Residential estates according to master plan)? Or are we going to build on Dover forest plot while we continue to let those plots lay vacant? 

The last time I talked about this someone replied saying that it’s besides the point since they will eventually be built up as residences and we will still need the land in the future. That doesn’t change the fact that there are available lands that have not been touched, and they want to tear down a forest for more land. This is an epic failure in resource planning no matter how you try to justify it. Do you really still believe we are land-scarced to the point that we need to destroy our forests to build houses?

In contrast, regular families can only afford BTOs in less prime locations. And would not make such a huge profit after MOP.

Another thing that I often noticed is that people tend to think of urban planning as coming up with this perfect, detailed map of the future we want and will lay out exactly what we will work towards. In reality, there's no real perfect solution. 

Urban planning is all about making compromises. We only have so much resources in the world, especially in Singapore where land is limited, every development comes at a cost. You can't expect to have everything you want fulfilled, what we can expect is simply the fulfilment of certain areas that are deemed to be priorities.

You make a valid point in terms of impact but you must also realize that the larger impact cases are the ones where more is at stake and stakeholders (who may not see from the perspective of sustainability) are more likely to NOT accede to or account for environmental concerns. For example, if people were to lobby to save the entire Tengah forest, I highly doubt that the end outcome would be to preserve it simply because so much is at stake (e.g. more HDB for HDB-starved millennials, etc). With respect to your example on oil refineries, the economic trade-offs would be so staggeringly high that it would be very very unlikely to happen unless the contribution to the economy by the refineries have reduced substantially (as may be the case in the next couple of decades).

This would be in the interests of flat buyers, but not the interests of existing HDB flat owners, whose capital (mostly as CPF monies) are locked up in them.

Prices of new BTOs are set by HDB, pegged to resale market prices of HDB flats in the vicinity/neighbourhood. Those who have capital and are looking to grow it would seek to buy BTOs likely to appreciate most in market value, to give the best \_returns\_.

So, while those with sizeable capital might conceivably prefer living in 'upper middle class' areas to 'working class' areas, they just want to grow their money (i.e. to flip).  In any case, HDB estates have almost always been a mix of larger (5-room/3G) and smaller (4-room/3-room/2-room) flats.

So, the question of whether one chooses to buy and live in 'atas' HDB estates or not is determined less by one's income/class than by other factors.

With an aging population, there will be fewer children and fewer schools are needed. With fewer people, there is less infrastructure needed.

> Depends. If you are in a dense environment, adding more amenities helps push property prices up.

Between this and Clementi, I would rather they save Clementi forest instead. On a satellite map, this small piece of forest (Dover) is made worse by having been cut into two, with the middle cleared for a path to connect the landed estate to the MRT.

There’s no way the government will save both. Getting them to save even one of them is hard. I don’t wish for people to blindly support this and end up causing *far more ecological harm* by increasing the pressure to destroy the 2nd largest wildlife habitat (Clementi forest), or other ecologically important sites elsewhere.

Dover forest looks like its just a shittier version of Clementi forest. If one has to go, it’s clearly Dover. Both are previously plantation land reclaimed by nature.

Also, Dover can easily support huge 40-stories HDBs that could *delay* the destruction of other ecologically rich sites, by packing more people on less land.

So far, none of the ""alternatives"" suggested come anywhere close in terms of providing the same value per dollar. Buy over golf courses? You gonna pay the golf course owners? Or are we gonna start our communist revolution today? 

All their alternatives are just more expensive (buying over someone else's plot) or not equivalent (telling HDB to build in the boonies of Punggol instead).

The environmental study already raised ideal points for conservation of that forest. Besides, it makes sense considering that there are multiple existing empty grassland sites near the forest from past SERS estates - at Dover Estate near Fairfield Methodist and another at Ghim Moh. So why are we hell bent on flattening the entire patch of Dover forest now for more BTOs?

The huge crowds treading through the various nature trails in Bukit Timah, MacRitchie and a few others every weekend proved that there is a demand for nature getaways. At some point we have to question is Singapore worth living and working in if you’re just going to flatten all available forested area zoned for other human uses in the Master Plan into endless concrete jungles?

We have lost a lot, a lot of biodiversity from the rampant development in the 50+ years of independence. Older estates such as Toa Payoh, Queenstown and Clementi proved that intensifying existing built-up areas do work. In addition we already have Tengah (as much as i grudgingly agree to deforest that entire area for the sake of development) as THE new residential district for future generations of homebuyers.

You can’t save everything.

It isn’t just between this two. It’s Dover vs other green areas on the chopping board. I used Clementi forest as a straightforward comparison because of its similarity, to illustrate that Dover might not be as ecologically important as other potential sites for development, and it’s preservation will no doubt increase pressure to harm other nature sites.

Worse if its preservation increase pressure to harm more ulu nature sites, because larger areas of land will have to be cleared to build low density HDB as compared to Dover, where the densest of HDBs can be built (region not under height restrictions, next to MRT). 

10-stories HDB vs 40-stories HDB. You need to clear 4x more land to house as many people, or you can see it as clearing 4x *less* land to house as many.

As others had discussed in other similar posts, golf courses are planned to be taken back, so where else can we go to get more land, other than other nature/forested sites? The rich and the ministers sure as hell aren’t going to give up their landed to build HDBs...",t3_kyhcol,17-01-2021

Other than those in Tanah Merah & Sentosa, the lease of all the golf courses in Singapore are slated to end in the mid 20s to the early 30s.

The reason why the government doesn't want to use the land acquisition act is because:

1. No pressing need to build stuff on those land
2. Cost of fighting a law suits
3. Lease ending soon, just wait and then the land is yours (the government)
