Anw, do I support 377a? I think we should move towards an open society. The changes will probably be more towards the social side with maybe changes for the financial tax structure ( can gay couples adopt? The tax benefits they get accorded - how much should it be?  Need to ensure that the child understands) and legal wise (can there be marital rape between 2 gay guys or female.)

Easy to claim of course - just follow the same rules for straight couples but it's rarely so clean for big changes. 

The gay groups having more rights is a good thing to me. but I think the government's resistance to the idea is because the issues above need to be thought out and compromises be made. Religious wise, there is probably some push back but ultimately I think it's the practical problems that are causing the inertia.

But we need to have all these difficult dialogues to make the society more inclusive. Problem is the dialogue might not even be taking place.

Someone's got to have power in the end. Might as well be you, especially if you have some socio-political change you want to implement.

Maybe it's my personal bias speaking here: I frequently get annoyed by those who have lofty ideals of social change, but refuse to even attempt to gain the power and control needed to implement those changes. Typically because setting your life on a course to gain socio-political power, is a lot harder than adding a filter to your Facebook picture or Instagram story to 'raise awareness'. Ideals with no power have no impact on society.

Letters and emails tend to be ignored. In-person meetings are far more effective to get things done. Anyway, do you know if they've met their MPs?

>It's easy to say ""Just join the government and change it from the inside"" but doing it is extremely difficult.

Yes, it's *difficult* to do that, but it's *necessary* for anyone who wants to lead socio-political change.

> If it's already difficult for an accepted marginalized group to get to a certain government position (aka non-chinese PM)

I agree with the government that the general electorate isn't ready for an Indian PM, but non-Chinese are actually slightly over-represented in Parliament due to the GRC system.

And incidentally I know several LGBT people who are in pretty high positions in the civil service, though they (currently) have no intention to use their positions to promote LGBT rights. ""It's too difficult"" is a poor excuse when it's already been done.

>Perhaps I'm bad at searching but haven't the government been criticized for being disconnected from the ground and not acting on the feedback from the ground?

I suspect those critics are the ones who are disconnected from both the government and the ground. Ignoring LGBT rights and keeping quiet about 377A *is* the PAP acting on feedback from the ground.

Like look at people in this very subreddit saying that (my paraphrasing) ""most young SGeans are pro-LGBT-rights and when they grow up they'll vote out the PAP and repeal 377A"". It's the kind of profoundly ignorant remark about local SGean attitudes, that one can only make after being insulated from reality by echo chamber effects. Just look at this thread (linked below), where people end up ostracised and isolated after coming out. These are the actual people who'll grow up into the electorate in a decade or two. https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/l5dj1m/lgbt_individuals_how_wereare_your_experiences_in/

They could at least just stand aside or exit somewhere and not blame the poor lady. What if it happens to them? I'm not trying to curse, but this could happen to anyone even with this near to zero possibility.

Thank you to Mr Brandon and other first respondents. They have saved a person's leg and perhaps life. It really is something of significance and the very act of assisting ASAP has made a lot of differences. 

I hope after this incident, many people could start changing their mindset and do something when encountering emergencies or at the very least move away. Never give words to discourage a person, don't stand around and give pressure to the lady. This lady is receiving unduely pressure and its never her fault to begin with. 

It is important to note that while the SMRT staff took 40+ seconds, I would say it would be really prompt assistance even though I believe the fastest response would be the most ideal.

I know many often ignores the MRT voice that always repeats the same thing. But this 'mind the gap' is of significant importance. Remember, safety is of the utmost priority.

> SINGAPORE - A woman who was travelling on the Circle Line had her leg trapped in the gap in between the platform at Buona Vista Station and an MRT train during the Monday morning (April 8) peak period.

> In a Facebook post on Monday morning, user Brandon Wong said that the train was ""full to the brim and passengers were rushing to get out of the train"".

> A woman fell after she was pushed and her right leg was caught in the gap from the knee down.

> The Facebook user added that he tried to calm the woman down and assisted SMRT staff in lifting her leg out of the gap.

> SMRT vice-president of corporate communications Margaret Teo confirmed the incident in a statement on Monday and said that the emergency stop feature at the platform was activated immediately, before station staff and other commuters helped to free the woman's leg.

> The incident happened at about 8.45am on the train travelling towards HarbourFront.

> The woman was later taken to National University Hospital.

> ""Our care team is reaching out to her and we hope she recovers quickly,"" Ms Teo said.

> She added that the incident led to a 10-minute delay in train service.

> Commuters were told of the service delay through in-train and station announcements.

> In his Facebook post, Mr Wong urged train commuters to help others in need and sympathise with them, rather than simply ""stand around taking photographs and videos"".

> He also suggested that SMRT should work on its staff's emergency response time and train them more often on how to carry out first aid.

> Related Story Woman wheeling mother stepped in train gap; refused to go to hospital

> Related Story Passers-by awarded for saving man who suffered cardiac arrest in MRT train

> ""The lady's leg got caught at 8.45am, the first SMRT staff on the scene arrived 45 seconds later, the second one more than a minute later,"" he wrote.

> ""I understand that the morning crowd at Buona Vista can get pretty unmanageable, but there has to be more urgency. Furthermore, any talk of an ambulance wasn't even initiated until more than 10 minutes later. In my view, that's far too slow.""

> Mr Wong also said that one of the staff was anxious and shouting at the woman to move her leg while she was in pain.

> When he noticed that the woman was helpless, he held her hand to reassure her that the train had been manually stopped and that they would help her get her leg out of the gap.

> He said that a medical student eventually stepped forward to help at about 9am.

> His Facebook post left users divided, with some questioning his critic over SMRT staff in the comments.

> User Shamsul said: ""45 seconds is already quite fast, unless the MRT staff was just standing 20m away.""

> Others applauded him for his thoughtfulness.

> ""Thank you very much for (your) quick thinking, young man. It could be anyone's mother or sister or daughter,"" wrote another user.

> The user noted that while other commuters stared or were busying themselves with other things, he had come forward to help ""without hesitation... Kudos"".
