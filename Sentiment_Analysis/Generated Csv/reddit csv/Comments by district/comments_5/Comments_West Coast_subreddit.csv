Our lives are very different now, being back in the US for 4 years now. But I got to show her this video and talk about our life in Singapore this morning when I dropped her off for school.

7,4,g9mljth,t3_jftoig,"Did you know that sand bathing is an animal behavior characterized by rolling or moving around in dust, dry earth or sand, with the likely purpose of removing parasites from fur, feathers or skin. Dust bathing is a maintenance behavior performed by a wide range of mammalian and avian species. For some animals, dust baths are necessary to maintain healthy feathers, skin, or fur, similar to bathing in water or wallowing in mud. In some mammals, dust bathing may be a way of transmitting chemical signals (or pheromones) to the ground which marks an individual's territory.",t3_jftoig,22-10-2020

This would also shows another thing.  Bigger parties use the presence of posters to signal their power. Smaller parties/independent candidates (they are at a big disadvantage cos they don't have a party brand name nor resources. So posters would be a cheap way to get their name out) use them to inform the public. People see so many PAP related posters will somehow think : ""Waaah, they must be financially strong/serious in this election cos they are everywhere and so many posters"" but if you see lesser opposition posters you might somehow think ""Aiyoh, they cannot make it lah...so less posters.

> SINGAPORE - Dr Tan Cheng Bock led over 200 members and volunteers for his party's first door-to-door home visits in West Coast GRC on Sunday morning (Jan 12).

> When asked if this was a signal that the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) intended to contest the area at the upcoming polls, he did not give a direct answer.

> Dr Tan told The Straits Times: ""The reception has been warm. Tell them: I'm coming home.""

> Barring major changes to electoral boundaries, PSP is widely expected to contest in West Coast at the next general election, as the constituency includes the area formerly under single-seat Ayer Rajah. Dr Tan had served as the People's Action Party (PAP) MP for six terms until it was absorbed into West Coast GRC in 2006.

> Sunday's home visits were the party's first major grassroots event of the year, involving 22 teams covering about 50 blocks in the GRC's Teban Gardens and Pandan Loop areas.

> The PSP was last seen in West Coast in December last year, at a much smaller walkabout at West Coast Market with around 40 members.

> When asked about the choice of the PAP stronghold for his party's first home visits, he said: ""We have a plan, so now we have decided to come here. The places we go and the things we do; these are all very calibrated and well-calculated.""

> Dr Tan's ""home ground"" advantage seemed apparent when several residents greeted him with familiarity as he walked through the food centre at Block 37 Teban Gardens Road.

> Madam Diana Salleh, 38, said she received an Edusave award as a Secondary 4 student in 1996 from Dr Tan when he was MP.

> ""I remember him from all those years back, so I was eager to see him today,"" said Madam Diana, who has lived at the nearby Block 44 for 35 years.

> Mr Chan Ewe Chong, who works in the security sector, also recalled Dr Tan's friendly and personable manner from over three decades back. But he added that Ms Foo Mee Har, the GRC's current MP overseeing Ayer Rajah ward, has also been working hard.

> ""Frankly, she has been doing quite a lot of good for residents around here. It will be a tough fight!,"" said the 65-year-old father of three.

> During his walk, Dr Tan bumped into Ms Foo and the two exchanged greetings and shook hands.

> Ms Foo, now in her 10th year as the area's MP, told The Straits Times that she was on her usual Sunday routine - having breakfast and chatting with the residents.

> On what she thought of a possible PSP contest in West Coast, Ms Foo said that her team has a good relationship with the residents and will continue to their best.

> ""At the end of day, the residents are in the best position to judge who can most ably serve their interests and take care of their day to day needs. Our work at Ayer Rajah continues,"" she said.

> Related Story Gearing up for GE: Tan Cheng Bock ready to take on his former party in GE

> Dr Tan congratulated the PAP team for ""doing a lot of good work"" in West Coast.

> He was also asked for his views on the alliance between four opposition parties - Singaporeans First party, Democratic Progressive Party, People's Power Party and Reform Party - reported earlier this month.

> This means the four parties will contest the next general election under one banner, shrinking the crowded field of 11 opposition parties to eight.

> Dr Tan said that while he has met members of each party, he did not want to commit the PSP to the alliance.

> ""I'm still building my own team. They are entitled to what they want to do, it's fair... but we are looking at the bigger picture.""

> That‚Äôs what Tan Cheng Bock told The Straits Times, when asked if he intended to contest the PAP‚Äôs hold over West Coast Group Representation Constituency (GRC).

> While he stopped short of giving a direct answer to the question, Tan and his Progress Singapore Party (PSP) were out in force in the constituency on Sunday morning (Jan. 12) greeting residents door-to-door.

> Advertisement

> According to a post on the PSP‚Äôs Facebook page, about 200 members spent four hours visiting 50 blocks of flats in the Teban Gardens and Pandan Loop area.

> Tan was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Ayer Rajah Single Member Constituency (SMC) for 26 years until he retired in 2006. The SMC was then absorbed into the West Coast GRC.

> According to The Straits Times, Tan described the decision to conduct the walkabout in what has historically been a PAP stronghold as part of the PSP‚Äôs plan.

> ‚ÄúThe places we go and the things we do; these are all very calibrated and well-calculated.‚Äù

> Bumping into a future rival

> During the visit, Tan bumped into Foo Mee Har, one of the incumbent MPs for the GRC.

> Foo is the MP of the Ayer Rajah constituency of West Coast GRC.

> The Straits Times reported that the pair exchanged pleasantries, while the PSP later wished Foo ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù on Facebook.

> ‚ÄúMs Foo Mee Har is quite good. I heard she takes care (of the residents),‚Äù said Tan according to Today.

> ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way it should be. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs me or whoever but the important thing is to make sure that people who live in this area are given the facilities that they asked for‚Äù

> He also praised the PAP for ‚Äúdoing a lot of good work here‚Äù.

> Advertisement

> Not ready to lead opposition alliance

> According to Today, despite being invited to lead an opposition alliance, Tan said that he was not ready to do so.

> He, instead, wanted to focus on his own party for the time being.

> ‚ÄúI have met all these people but I don‚Äôt want to commit myself just yet because I‚Äôm still building my own team properly first. They are all entitled to do what they want.‚Äù

> Tan and the PSP had previously held meetings with other opposition parties, before the Singaporeans First (SingFirst) party, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), People‚Äôs Power Party (PPP), and Reform Party (RP) announced they had formed an alliance.

> Today reported Tan Jee Say of Singfirst ‚Äî and the current leader of the alliance ‚Äî as saying that the four parties were still looking forward to Tan Cheng Bock leading the alliance.

> ‚ÄúVery likely we all want to see us come together,‚Äù said the leader of PSP, according to Today.

> ‚ÄúBut the form, the manner, the way in which we are going to come together is all still open.‚Äù

> Families and enterprises will be invited plant the trees and green up the industrial belt, which will help cool down some of the warmest areas of Singapore.

> Climate change is a long-term challenge

> Lee said that aside from Covid-19, problems like climate change will also hit Singapore hard.

> The importance of investing in long-term solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change was mentioned by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day Rally speech in 2019.

> He said:

> ""No doubt Singapore's emissions pale in comparison to bigger countries, but we all must play our part, and start by taking small steps, in the local community, industry, all parts of Singapore.""

> Lee, who previously represented Jurong GRC, will be standing in West Coast GRC for the upcoming election.

> He was joined by Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran, Foo Mee Har, Ang Wei Neng and newcomer Rachel Ong.

659,4,e9lx7wb,t1_e9lt91n,Sounds kinda fishy..,t3_9wmr6k,13-11-2018
660,4,e9lxrt8,t1_e9lt91n,"That sounds like air freight to me, like you've mentioned, no airliners will allow batteries that huge. Definitely fishy.

Heck, I couldn't even get my forwarders to take a shipment of wrist computers that use lithium button cells.",t3_9wmr6k,13-11-2018
661,4,e9lxv4b,t1_e9lxrpb,"Hm but the one on Carousell is used leh.

I am not familiar with e-scooters in particular but for most vehicles (be it cars or bicycles), once something is marked ""used"" (even if just for one day), you usually can't get more than half the original price.

And it seems like someone in the US can buy [a brand new one for US$2,280](https://www.ewheels.com/product/new-dualtron-ii-ex-1200wh-1600w-motors/). So I really don't think there is much of an arbitrage opportunity here.",t3_9wmr6k,13-11-2018
662,4,e9ltevq,t1_e9ltb7e,"Export out of Singapore is fine. But you are wanting to import them right? Might be legal to import them, but it is illegal to sell them or ride them.",t3_9wmr6k,13-11-2018
663,4,e9ly8e2,t1_e9lxv4b,"Ah, not quite the same. The limited has a much larger battery and some other bits on it, hence the price difference.

The dualtron 2 ex's on carousell are even cheaper, like $900 Singapore dollars.

Used good prices vary wildly depending on what kind of product you're talking about and what brands. Like a used Honda loses value much slower than a used Fiat, because Fiats fall apart.

As far as I can tell, dualtrons are super sturdy, last a long time, and are easy to service, so buying a used one isn't much of a hit",t3_9wmr6k,13-11-2018

665,4,e9lycy5,t1_e9ly8e2,"Alright then, I remain sceptical.

But as for your shipping issue, my suggestion would be to look for people flying from Singapore to the US. A prime candidate would be students looking to make an easy buck.",t3_9wmr6k,13-11-2018
