37,4,du6b5kz,t3_7x8hs2,"A bit of a short story, thought of something bite-sized for the social media addict:

> Valentine's Day, 1942.

> Yesterday's attack by the Imperial Japanese Army surprised the B Company of the newly-formed Malay regiment, 3 years into service, left many soldiers of the said company dead, and only a few of them save a number of the 44th Indian Brigade, managed to retreat back to the general line at Mount Echo. The enemy continued the assault with their mortar and artillery fire in the morning, and the Malay Brigade held on. However, enemy tanks were spotted in the left flank of the line, penetrating and forcing the defenders back to a line near the Brick Works and Bukit Chermin.

> Lt. Col. Andre, who headed the Malaya Brigade, issued an order to his men to retreat and reposition their defences over Bukit Chandu.

> It was a high time for one Malay soldier of the 1st Malaya Regiment. His compatriots in B Company, whom he shared a common bond of fishing and relaxation before this war had happened, had mostly been killed. Their only way to save themselves, D Company across the canal here, are blocked by flaming oil that flowed from Normanton Depot. The artillery fire rattled the senses of men to real-life attrition of war, and without any way to last the upcoming night without an inevitable capture, he was shaken by the idea of death.

> In the remaining reserves of their ammunition supply spot, he hustled double-time to supply the forward squads with mortar rounds to attempt at waylay the impending Japanese troops. As he ran towards the forward squads, he tripped against a loose rock and almost lost his balance, live rounds and all.

> Lt. Adnan Saidi managed to stop him from setting off a round, killing himself.

> ""Baik-baik tengok depan tu!"" commanded Lt. Saidi. The soldier immediately composed himself up and tried his best to utter a, ""Yes, sir!"" to his superior. Lt. Adnan lectured him, instead.

> ""Bukan sekarang untuk 'Yes, sir!' Kita sekarang masih berperang, kian Maghrib kita boleh bincang lagi,"" Lt. Adnan suggested again.

> Nodded, the soldier continued his last spurt towards the forward squads of their last remaining mortar round they had. It will be the longest day for the soldier and the rest of the Malaya regiment. It will also be the day he knew, should he fell here, the future will be replete with tales of the men's defence of Bukit Chandu.

> Little did he know that he would not see his brother again.",t3_7x8hs2,13-02-2018

Yes they do wear media vests - in hope that they don't get shot at.

96,4,du7jgfg,t1_du7g2f5,"Clearly you lacked the objectivity here and has only been emphasising on the racial aspect of the issue ever since.  

Your argument stems from the fact that you assumed that no equal opportunities were given to the other races, how true is that ? I’m not too sure, as I believe none of us here actually has the objective statistical data that supports your argument . 

I merely justified the fact that “if certain policy is in placed” as claimed here, it would highly be done with careful consideration. 

I could only justify from the Chinese point of view as I’m Chinese myself. For Indians, it has long been known that it is hard to unify India itself as individuals are more likely to identify themselves with the language they speak, which there are hundreds over different languages in India alone. 

If you have to claim that such policy is in place and it is racist, could the same be spoken for the additional welfare and benefits that one race in particular has been getting over the years. Which brings me to the question, is our government racist towards the other races, as they do not receive equal welfare and benefits ?

From what I see here, all you are trying to portray here, is the very obstinate mindset that only provides you with a one sided view of matters and not the other. 

Frankly speaking, if given a choice, plenty of army boys will be flogging towards the home team instead of the army. Is that “racism in play” as claimed, to restrict majority of the other races to serve in the army as claimed, and giving a particular race more opportunity to be serving in the home team instead ?

145,4,dzw6w80,t1_dzv9yzd,"Based on the colour of the plumage, OP's photo seems to show a domestic chicken though.

The red junglefowl is differentiated from its domesticated kin by a few physical characteristics, such as the colour of the legs (grey in red junglefowl, yellow in domestic chicken), the presence of a white ear patch (present in red junglefowl, but often absent in domestic chicken), as well as colour of the plumage (rooster of the red junglefowl has glossy dark green tail and wing feathers). Your Pasir Ris male, the hens at Pasir Ris and Botanic Gardens, and one of the roosters in the East Coast Park clique appear to be red junglefowl (or at least high-content hybrids; I'll explain more in a bit), whereas the other two roosters in the East Coast Park clique with more white in their plumage are likely to be domestic chickens, or hybrids.

The red junglefowl is generally said to be the wild ancestor of the domestic chicken; however, it's quite complicated. It's believed that red junglefowl were tamed in several different parts of Asia, eventually giving rise to the many different breeds of domestic chicken that exist today. And it's also possible that other junglefowl species may have been involved as well; the gene that codes for yellow legs in domestic chickens appears to have been contributed by the grey junglefowl, a different species that is native to southern India.

Because the red junglefowl readily cross-breeds with domestic chickens, especially in areas where red junglefowl overlap with free-roaming domestic fowl, there is a risk that the red junglefowl's gene pool is being 'polluted' with genes from domestic chickens. Traits that are neutral or advantageous in domestic chickens might end up giving hybrid offspring a disadvantage in the wild, or become so prevalent that the red junglefowl as a wild species vanishes altogether, completely replaced by birds with varying degrees of domestic chicken ancestry. As an aside, this isn't exclusive to chickens; there are fears that in areas where domestic animals and their wild (often already endangered) relatives meet, the wild populations may have their genes swamped with those from the often more numerous domestic animals, potentially jeopardising the survival of the wild species.

Depending on the parentage, hybrids between red junglefowl and domestic chickens might display domestic chicken traits, such as colour variations in plumage, or yellow legs. But if these hybrids then end up reproducing with red junglefowl, it's more likely that the red junglefowl traits will be dominant in subsequent offspring, with the occasional individual having the right combination of genes to express domestic chicken traits.

Some of the supposed red junglefowl in various parts of mainland Singapore have colours that suggest that somewhere in their ancestry, domestic chickens were involved; I think it's likely that these flocks comprise a mixture of 'pure' red junglefowl, domestic chickens that have been abandoned by owners or allowed to roam freely, and hybrids. Pulau Ubin is likely to be the best (only?) place to see ['pure' red junglefowl](https://www.flickr.com/photos/fryap/22754953570/), although whether 'pure' red junglefowl even exist anymore is up for debate.

[Here's an interesting article](https://www.nature.com/news/when-chickens-go-wild-1.19195) about a feral population of chickens in Hawaii, and how domestication so dramatically changes animals that even feral populations of domestic animals never truly revert to looking like their wild ancestors.",t3_8nf01b,31-05-2018
