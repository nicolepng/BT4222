> SINGAPORE: A former Head of Department for English at Woodgrove Secondary School was found guilty on Monday (Jan 11) of misappropriating S$40,000 paid by students for learning materials.

> Maslinda Zainal, 46, was convicted of two counts of criminal breach of trust as a public servant after a trial that spanned almost two years.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam found that there was entrustment of the money to Maslinda in her capacity as a public servant.

> ""I find that the accused has misappropriated the entrusted monies and I find that there is dishonesty on her part,"" said the judge. ""I therefore find that the prosecution has established beyond a reasonable doubt all the charges and you are accordingly found guilty and convicted.""

> Maslinda, who had a gross monthly salary of S$8,800, was in charge of collecting money submitted by students to their English teachers for learning materials known as Excel packages.

> However, she over-collected about S$40,000 from the students between January 2016 and April 2017.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The suspended teacher, who has a masters in education and had multiple teachers reporting to her at the time, denied the charges and said she did not keep records of the cash as nobody told her she needed to.

> She had admitted in police statements that she had taken the sum of S$39,000 to S$40,000, saying that she spent the money on her own expenses such as food and did not buy anything lavish with it.

> She also testified in court that she had used the money to buy stationery and other items for the students.

> Advertisement

> The offences came to light when the school's lower-secondary head for English Jacqueline Chan asked the bookshop seller on the first day of school in 2016 for a copy of the invoices for the books.

> The seller responded that Maslinda had told her to give the invoices only to Maslinda and not to hand them to Ms Chan.

> When Ms Chan eventually obtained a copy of the invoices, she realised there was a discrepancy between the amounts being collected by the teachers and the amounts on the invoices.

> She later flagged the issue to a vice-principal and the principal was shocked to discover such a large over-collection. Ministry of Education (MOE) investigators and later the police were called in, and Maslinda was cuffed and taken away from school grounds.

> All 20 teachers in the school's English department testified in court during the course of the trial, and they said Maslinda did not tell them about the excess money being collected.

> The defence's case was three-pronged: Maslinda did not count or keep records of the cash handed to her and it was possible that some teachers had not paid her in full according to the book list, the invoices before the court did not fully reflect the sums paid to the book shop and the excess money had been used for the benefit of the students with no dishonesty.

> The Ministry of Education told CNA in November 2018 when the trial began that it takes a serious view of educator misconduct, but could not say more as the matter was before the courts.

> The prosecution asked for an adjournment to prepare arguments on the sentence.

> For criminal breach of trust as a public servant, Maslinda could be jailed up to 10 years and fined for each charge.

Can you imagine if you had a book list of 10 books and student choose to buy what they could and overall there's an excessive, how do they calculate the excess amount? And we are looking at all students in the while school.

The fees she collected was used to pay for stationeries and other adhoc materials for students and school use. It's not as if she had a motive to plan and collect more money from students and channel it to other uses like buying lavish products or gambling or any other personal uses.

To put into context, such collections by teachers are actually not unusual in education sector although should be occurring less as schools now make parents sign GIRO deduction or Edusave deduction authorisations to the school/MOE for such miscellaneous purchases for school use.

It's just that usually the people in charge are honest and scrupulous and any excess collected would be reported and proper approval be sought how to handle the excess. Smart educators would generally first try to get the admin folks to handle such collections/payments. And smarter educators would get the vendor to directly collect from student/parent which many schools do, i.e. you order school textbooks direct with the vendor, who deliver to you and collect money from you (parent or student).",t3_kuz1br,13-01-2021

HOD of acting blur only haha

Do HODs like her get a lot of autonomy in handling cash? Who do HODs report to? VP?

Feels like there's potentially a lapse on the management side, if she could get away with this for ~~a year~~ 5 years?? plus undetected under their noses. It does appear that it was accepted practice to not have to record/account for cash passing thru. It's not like she was supposed to submit periodic reports to the VP, and falsified records. She didn't even need to.

> She is accused of misappropriating about S$40,000 meant for students' learning materials between January 2016 and April 2017.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Maslinda told the court the money collected was meant for the printing of Excel packages, which were used in place of English textbooks and workbooks for the students.

> When the packages were introduced in 2007, they were printed in-house at the school for all students, she said.

> This continued until 2012, when then-principal Sung Mee Har called for such heavy printing to be outsourced, with the cost to be borne by students, she added.

> When questioned by her lawyer Singa Retnam of IRB Law, Maslinda said there was no surplus cash collected until April 2016, when she realised there was money left over in the box where she usually kept it.

> She could not return the funds as she did not keep records of who had paid or how much had been initially collected, she claimed.

> She said she decided to use the extra money to buy assessment books and stationery for the students, which she noted was usually paid for out of pocket by teachers.

> She thought this was “okay” as the items were to be used by students for their schoolwork, she said.

> The stationery, which she said all teachers had access to, was kept in boxes in her cubicle at work, said Maslinda.

> However, she noted she could not prove to investigators that they had been bought with the money as she could not produce receipts of their purchase.

> About S$8,000 had been recovered when investigators searched Maslinda’s desk on Apr 7, 2017, the day she was arrested.

> Another S$11,000 was found in her handbag, though Maslinda told them this was her own money.

> Maslinda claimed that investigators had told her there was still some S$34,000 which was unaccounted, and that she would not be charged if the amount was paid in full.

> She paid the amount on May 17, 2017, she said, explaining that she felt responsible as she had not kept records of the money that was collected.

> She also did not want the school to be responsible for the loss of the money or the students to suffer for her negligence, she said.

> Despite this however, Maslinda was charged in October that year.

> The accused allegedly misappropriated S$40,000 that was entrusted to her in her capacity as the Head of Department in Woodgrove Secondary School. (Screengrab from Google Street View)

> ""GREED""

> In her cross-examination, Deputy Public Prosecutor Stephanie Chew pointed out a discrepancy from an invoice dated Feb 3, 2016, stating that Maslinda had collected about S$1,700 for the materials for a particular module for Secondary One students which only cost about S$500 to print.

> Ms Chew added that on Feb 15 that year, Maslinda had even sent text messages to other teachers, asking them to make payment.

> Maslinda however countered by claiming that she did not receive the invoice until much later, and that as a teacher for the Secondary Four and Five students, she did not know what materials Secondary One teachers required or how much they had to pay.

> Earlier on Tuesday in court, Maslinda said that there were multiple missing invoices.

> However, Ms Chew pointed out that this was not brought up when the school bookshop staff member responsible for overseeing the printing - referred to as Colleen - had appeared in court.

> The alleged missing invoices were an “afterthought”, said Ms Chew.

> Ms Chew also pointed to a statement made by Maslinda to the police in which the accused had said the unaccounted cash was spent “not solely for myself”, and asked if this meant she had spent some of the money for herself.

> Maslinda however said she was referring to stationery she had bought for teaching purposes.

> When asked why she did not explain to police that was what she had meant, Maslinda said she was not asked to clarify what she had said.

> Maslinda told the court that she had no need to pocket the extra money, pointing to the S$7,000 after Central Provident Fund contributions she brought home each month as a head of department.

> In one of six statements made to the police, Maslinda had admitted to taking about S$10,000.

> Maslinda had previously said that she had been harassed by investigators, and that her statements were made under duress.

> On Tuesday, Ms Chew had also asked Maslinda if she knew that spending the money on items that were not Excel packages - without the knowledge or consent of students - was wrong, and if the decision was made unilaterally.

> As a senior teacher, who had taught at Woodgrove Secondary for 15 years, Maslinda should have been familiar with what to do with cash, said the Deputy Public Prosecutor.

> Maslinda replied that she did not think it was wrong at the time.

> Ms Chew also noted that an ex-colleague of Maslinda’s previously said in court that the former head of department had replied “greed”, when asked via text message how she had gotten into her predicament.

> Maslinda however said that the exchange had never happened, claiming that she had no contact with the teacher in question since the end of 2016 when she stopped teaching at Woodgrove Secondary, or with any of her other colleagues since her arrest.

> The trial continues on Wednesday.

> If convicted of criminal breach of trust, Maslinda can be jailed up to 10 years and fined for each charge.

Excellent English but fail in math. 8.8k salary want to risk everything for 40k.

Opportunity  cost? 16 years (retire at 60) x 8.8k x 15mths = 2.1million, not  factoring pay increments over the years and CPF which would earn her  upwards of 3 million.
