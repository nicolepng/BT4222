0,24,edvlkop,t3_af3ws5,"I wonder how they defined ""low conservation significance"". Sometimes I worry whether these areas of habitat are deemed worthless only because they aren't primary rainforest, even though these secondary forest, woodland and scrub areas still provide habitat for a number of threatened plant and animal species.

A bit of a primer: Many of these patches of ""jungle"" scattered around Singapore are actually fairly young - the original rainforest was cleared, whether for timber, agriculture, or settlements, then abandoned, and the forest grew back. Some, like the forests in the fringes of Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves, are considered mature secondary rainforest, which have been growing for a long time, maybe around a century or even more. Most of the other patches in other areas of Singapore are more recent, with some only growing post-independence, when people were resettled from the kampungs and farms and plantations were abandoned, allowing some form of unmanaged vegetation to take over.

These young secondary forest patches are not the same as the rainforests you'll find in Bukit Timah or Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Species diversity and composition are usually very different; many of the plants and animals that depend on rainforest habitats will not use these young secondary forest areas, and you'll often get plants that are exotic, or were purposely grown by people, then became naturalised. For example, many of these secondary forests are dominated by rubber trees, as that was an important crop in the past. Areas where kampungs or fruit orchards once stood will often contain a high density of fruit trees like durian, jackfruit and rambutan, herbs like curry leaf and pandan, or ornamentals like dumbcane and heliconia. Even so, you will get some native forest plants that are characteristic of disturbed areas, and some of these secondary forest patches can still harbour small populations of threatened forest plants. And some forest animals are able to survive in these areas of secondary forest. In some locations, you don't get forest, but grassland or dense, open scrub. Forest species won't live here, but you will get other species that do prefer such habitats.

Given enough time and as long as connectivity with the surviving rainforests is maintained, these secondary forest patches have the chance to eventually undergo succession and revert to rainforest.

Not to mention the value of maintaining connectivity: Tengah Forest and the secondary forest areas in the Bukit Batok area (including Bukit Batok Nature Park) provide a corridor between the Western Catchment (itself a large area of secondary vegetation) and Bukit Timah. Animals can move between patches (although roads are a formidable barrier for many), while seeds and pollen of many plants can be transported back and forth. Now that Tengah is being developed, it's possible that this link will be severed, which may lead to genetic isolation. So instead of a single population of a certain species (for example, the pangolin), you get 2 smaller, isolated subpopulations. In the long run, even if the subpopulations of that species manage to maintain their numbers, their genetic diversity might be affected since they cannot easily mingle anymore, increasing the risk of inbreeding and making them more vulnerable to say, diseases or hereditary health issues, and ultimately increasing the risk of extinction. It's the same reason why the EcoLink@BKE has been seen as a very important step in restoring the connectivity that was lost when the BKE was built, separating Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves. Yet we're making the same mistake in other areas, simply because they're not nature reserves and thus seen to be of less importance. NParks has created so-called Nature Ways along many of our roads and park connectors, and while they will benefit many animals, most forest creatures aren't going to use them.

It's true that on its own, there might be nothing really special about an area of secondary forest, but it still provides habitat for a wide variety of plants and animals, many of which aren't true urban species, but might still be present in urban areas because of these secondary forests. I'm sure that for many of the creatures we find in urban areas, their strongholds are still in the nearby secondary forest patches. We may have a lot of urban greenery, and parks and gardens can provide important habitats, but we cannot assume that a secondary forest, with all its ecological functions, is interchangeable with and easily replaced by such managed areas.

I assume you're comparing it to the cost of constructing the same building in the city centre? Just need to note that constructing a building in the city centre is not a substitute/alternative to constructing a building in the suburbs. 

E.g. you decide how tall to build a HDB in Woodlands by looking at the land price and material price and you won't compare it with the land price in Toa Payoh because the Woodlands residents can't simply move to Toa Payoh.

But in suburban areas they do not have HDBs as tall as 40 storey which could be seen in those estates i mentioned. I also wanted to bring out a point that if you have taller buildings in those suburbans areas you would not need to build this tengah town and also be able to cater to the housing needs of Singapore (which this is what OP posted about, to conserve the forested area of Tengah). I would like to highlight again that whatever I compared is only BTO flats. The flats that married or soon to be married couples apply for.

> SINGAPORE: Around 4,800 workers have been issued a stay-home notice at Sungei Tengah Lodge, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Sunday (Aug 23), a day after a new COVID-19 cluster emerged at the dormitory.

> 

> Located at 500 Old Choa Chu Kang Road, the dormitory was among the largest COVID-19 clusters in Singapore with more than 2,200 confirmed cases before it was declared cleared of the coronavirus by MOM last month.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> As of Sunday, 58 cases have been linked to the new cluster, all of them asymptomatic.

> MOM said in a joint statement with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Building and Construction Authority (BCA) late on Sunday that the move to issue a stay-home notice was a precautionary measure while the health of the workers was being determined.

> The ministry said it will test the workers on stay-home notice over the next few days.

> “We expect to find among these workers, some who have evidence of an old infection and are no longer infectious. Such workers will be released from stay-home notice and can resume work,” said MOM.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Workers who test positive will be sent to community care facilities or hospitals for medical treatment, while those who test negative will be quarantined at centralised facilities to prevent any transmission during the viral incubation period.

> The rest of the residents at Sungei Tengah Lodge are either recently recovered or were not close contacts of confirmed cases. These workers will be allowed to continue working and are not required to be isolated.

> Workers who are not recently recovered will continue to undergo rostered routine testing.

> SAFETY TIME-OUT NOTICE

> In the statement, BCA said it has issued a safety time-out notice to 20 construction projects where the workers who tested positive for COVID-19 had been working.

> This is to allow for disinfection of the affected areas and a review of safe management measures at the work sites, it said.

> ""A stop-work order may then be issued for part or whole of the worksite once the area where the COVID-positive worker and his co-workers operate have been identified,"" said BCA.

> “The builder is required to review his safety management plans and make necessary rectification/improvement to mitigate any risk of further spread.”

> Sungei Tengah Lodge is Singapore's biggest purpose-built dormitory, with about 16,000 workers living there.

> In recent weeks, COVID-19 cases have been detected in migrant worker dormitories that were previously given the all-clear from the virus.

> A new cluster was identified on Sunday at Homestay Lodge at 39 Kaki Bukit Avenue 3. The dormitory was previously cleared of COVID-19 by MOM on Aug 4.

> “The new cases detected in the cleared dormitories demonstrate the importance of ongoing surveillance and testing under rostered routine testing, as well as the need to remain vigilant and adhere to safe management measures,” said MOM on Sunday.

Similar to how a doctor cannot certify one to be free of the virus unless said person is swabbed & isolated for 14 days, I would think most people should understand that infections can occur once they are out from isolation, unless they are recovered workers that still have antibodies protecting them?

Now it is just the question of how well it can be managed when they resume work. Time will tell if the Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) that is to be done every 14 days, plus all the safe management measures are good enough to contain the virus in the sectors that employ the workers.

From this pandemic, I do not have high hopes that humans (especially in large groups) can be trusted to obey instructions in general, and I do not only mean the migrant workers, but the general population worldwide.

People everywhere were stressed out, and for the dorms, its worsened. They might be worried for themselves or their families. They might be worried about health or finances. With that many people crammed into a room (see one of the video where so many heads were popping out of the small windows), its hard to give people space or keep things quiet enough to process things.

Unfortunately, I don’t think we have the infrastructure to support the mental needs of everyone yet. Its something the government should seek to improve. After all, even if the government doesn’t care about individual wellbeing, a depressed worker is a terrible worker and that is significant!

I envision a day, for starters, where community counsellors are reasonably ubiquitous, and one can just walk in and have a short talk with someone to give an extra perspective or a listening ear. Although its not going to do much for people deep into a crisis, but perhaps it would be sufficient to prevent small individual issues from festering and snowballing into something worse.

Just an idea: 

Why not set up community facilities, in the immediate term, where people can go and talk to a “counsellor”, but this “counsellor” is actually an ad-hoc volunteer given some training? I don’t know if this was done already, but since I haven’t heard of such things, there should still be much to improve!

There are many people with great friends who listens and provide support, so there is no lack of great individuals that can provide some form of mental support. I’m sure if marketed well, there should be sone volunteers willing to help out with something that is quite noble, which might help to improve things before any concrete policies could be made on this matter.

> SINGAPORE: The first batch of flats in Tengah’s Park District will be up for sale in the August Build-to-Order (BTO) exercise, said the Housing and Development Board (HDB) on Monday (Aug 10).

> This is the third district to be launched in Tengah, and it is where Singapore’s first “car-free” town centre will be located.

> “Roads are planned to run beneath the town centre, freeing up space at the ground level for retail and recreational use,” HDB said.

> “Separated from roads and traffic, the heart of the town centre will be safe and friendly for residents to walk and cycle.”

> A key feature of Park District will be Tengah’s “car-free” town centre which will be integrated with the nearby Central Park. (Photo: HDB)

> There will be a sports centre, retail spaces and eateries at the town centre, as well as an MRT station on the Jurong Region Line.

>

> The first BTO housing estate to be launched for sale in Park District is Parc Residences @ Tengah, comprising 12 residential blocks with 1,044 units of two-room flexi, three-room, four-room and five-room flats.

> Artist impression of Parc Residences @ Tengah, an integrated development with public housing and a neighbourhood centre. (Photo: HDB)

> Residents here will have access to a polyclinic, a supermarket, a food court, tuition centres and a childcare centre when the neighbourhood centre is completed in 2025.

> 

> “To encourage residents to adopt a healthier lifestyle, the neighbourhood centre will feature prominent stairways which open up directly into a variety of green community spaces on each floor,” said HDB.

> 

> Artist impression of homes at Park District offering views of greenery and the waterfront. (Photo: HDB)

> A COMMUNITY FARM AMONG THE GREEN SPACES

> Like Tengah’s two districts launched earlier, Park District features many green spaces.

> “Park District will be encircled by greenery and green spaces, with Central Park nearby and green ways such as the Forest Corridor and Forest Fringe,” said HDB.

> 

> Artist impression of Central Park, offering scenic and tranquil spots for residents to relax and enjoy various recreational activities. (Photo: HDB)

> At Central Park, an existing canal will be “naturalised and landscaped”.

> 

> There will also be a 5km-long stretch of greenery that will served as a habitat for native fauna, as well as form part of the larger ecological corridor between the Western Water Catchment Area and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve.

> 

> Residents will also have access to spaces for community gardening and farming.

> “Within Park District, the farmways are about 600 metres long and 40 metres wide on average. HDB will partner (the National Parks Board) to provide some 3,000 square metres of space, equivalent to the size of 33 four-room flats, for community gardening and farming within the farmways,” it said.

> “This is in addition to the community gardens within individual public housing projects.”

> Artist impression of the Rainforest Walk weaving through Parc Residences @ Tengah Build-to-Order (BTO) Project. (Photo: HDB)

> Another feature is the 1.5km-long Rainforest Walk which will weave through the housing projects.

> “Social-communal facilities such as nature-themed playgrounds, fitness stations, open green spaces and seating areas will feature along the Rainforest Walk, particularly at portions where it runs through the housing projects or intersects the farmways.”

> The multi-storey car park at Parc Residences @ Tengah has green features as well. Its rooftop garden will house playgrounds, fitness corners and a jogging track.

> 

> Artist impression of of the rooftop garden with lush greenery. (Photo: HDB)

> Artist Impression of the community event plaza filled with lush greenery that extends out into the Plantation Farmway. (Photo: HDB)

> Tengah is HDB’s 24th and newest town.

> About the size of Bishan, it is set to provide about 42,000 new homes in five districts when fully developed.

> In its August sales exercise, HDB will offer about 7,800 flats across Singapore for sale.

> Apart from the flats in Tengah, units in Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Choa Chu Kang, Geylang, Pasir Ris, Tampines and Woodlands will also be up for sale.

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed 94 more COVID-19 cases as of Friday (28 August) afternoon, bringing Singapore’s total to 56,666.

> Of them, four – all Singapore residents – are classified as cases in the community, while 10 are imported cases who have been placed on the stay-home notice or isolated upon their arrival here.

> Amongst the remaining 80 cases residing in dorms, 58 – over half of Friday’s daily tally – are from Sungei Tengah Lodge, who had all been placed on quarantine earlier, said the MOH.

> The vast majority of them were tested during quarantine to determine their status, or picked up through the rostered routine testing.

> “Following the detection of cases at Sungei Tengah Lodge, we had placed about 4,500 workers on quarantine, and tested about 3,000 of them so far,” added the ministry.

> The number of cases from the dorms is expected to continue to be high in the coming days as authorities complete testing of the remaining quarantined workers, it said.

> More details will be shared in the ministry’s press release later at night.

> This story will be updated later.

> With 168 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Thursday, 55,139 cases – some 97.4 per cent of the tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while none is in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 1,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 27 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 15 others who tested positive for the virus were determined to have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another four, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

Parts of the Tengah forest corridor will be cleared for viaducts.

LTA says that the portion being cut down till take about 3% of the 60 ha piece of forest and the trees will be replanted.  To facilitate wildlife movement, the HDB had earlier said that a  100m-wide and 5km-long forest corridor ""will be retained to provide a  habitat for plants and animals"".  LTA will also work with Nature Society, NParks and other environmental groups to mitigate the ecological fall out from this project.

Dr Ho Hua Chew, vice-president of the Nature Society's (Singapore)  conservation committee said the loss of mature trees along the forest  corridor was unfortunate, although the extent of impact would depend on  the exact location the viaducts will be built.

144,24,f0be8qd,t3_d4giky,"> # 3D-printing to be used in HDB project for the first time, in Tengah and Bidadari estates

> SINGAPORE - For the first time, 3D-printing could be used to build landscape furniture and architectural features in a Housing Board (HDB) estate, such as a bench or a pavilion, in the upcoming Tengah and Bidadari estates.

> Using such technology would not only allow for faster, cheaper, and less labour-intensive construction, it could also increase the potential for more unconventional designs than traditional precast methods.

> This is among projects that the HDB is embarking on to improve productivity amidst sluggish productivity growth in the construction industry. Details were shared in a media briefing on Thursday (Sept 12).

> Ongoing testing in 3D-concrete printing is being done at the HDB Centre of Building Research at Woodlands, where a printer capable of building components up to 9m long by 3.5m wide by 3.8m tall is located.

> Billed as the largest 3D-printer in South-east Asia, it successfully printed a room measuring 3.6m by 3m by 2.75m in 13 hours last month (August). The printer and the work involved in installing it cost about $900,000.

> However, further research and fine-tuning are needed to determine whether 3D-printed high-rise flats could be a possibility in future.

> For example, studies are needed to ascertain if the structural integrity of 3D-printed components remains intact over a long period and in Singapore's climate.

> Mr Heru Soedarsono, deputy director of Building Design & Precast System at HDB, said: ""The use of 3D-concrete printing has opened up new and exciting possibilities for the future of construction.

> ""Architect and designers would have more free play in their designs, greater flexibility, and since the printing process is highly automated, that reduces the dependency on manual labour,"" he told reporters on Thursday.

> Related Story Summit on 3D-printing technology gives insights into its future

> Related Story National Day Rally 2019: Learning 3D printing at 64

> He added that 3D-printing is still relatively new, and HDB will continue to work with industry experts to explore its potential.

> The whole process of building the 3D-printed room, including the manual insertion of steel reinforcement bars into the structure and fitting in windows and a door, took about six days.

> In comparison, it would take more than two months to build a similar room using the conventional method of precast production. Just fabricating the precast mould alone takes up to two months, said HDB, and this does not include the time taken to design it.

> It is costly to fabricate new moulds, which have to be done as each mould set will lose its form over time. With 3D-printing, such moulds will no longer be needed.

> HDB said that for a start, it will trial the use of 3D-concrete printing for smaller components used in precinct designs such as landscape furniture and architectural features in common areas at selected projects in Tengah and Bidadari.

> These include void deck designs and texture, such as customised sun and rain screens, and 3D-artwork panels. Theme precinct furniture and curvilinear precinct pavilions are among other possibilities.

> The Bidadari estate is scheduled to be completed by 2022, while the first of five housing districts to be developed in Tengah is slated for completion by 2023.

> Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Tuesday (Sept 10) at the HDB Awards 2019 that it is currently more expensive to use the 3D-printer.

> ""But if over time, if the cost can come down, this will be a possible game changer in construction productivity in the coming years,"" he added.

> He said that HDB achieved 17.8 per cent improvement in productivity last year (2018) compared to 2010 levels. This is on track to achieve 25 per cent productivity improvement by 2020 - a target that HDB set for itself.

> HDB now takes 174 man days to build a 90-metre squared space - the equivalent of a four-room flat, compared to 205 man days in 2010, said Mr Wong.

> But it is still pushing boundaries with new technologies, for example, by collaborating with local prefabrication company Robin Village Development, Dutch engineering firm Witteveen+Bos and the Nanyang Technological University to explore 3D-concrete printing's potential.

> This tie-up was announced in July last year (2018).

> VIDEO ANALYTICS AND AI FOR WORKER SAFETY

> Besides 3D-printing, HDB is also exploring the use of video analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve safety at construction sites, by automatically detecting high-risk situations and sending alerts to the person-in-charge.

> There are two scenarios currently being tested - when workers are within a metre of a non-barricaded building edge with a fall height of more than two metres, and when they are directly under the fall path of heavy loads lifted by tower cranes.

> Related Story 17 workplace fatalities in first half of 2019 - fewest since 2006

> Related Story Companies taking innovative steps to raise workplace safety

> When such situations arise and are caught by closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras at work sites, alerts will be sent to the safety supervisor's mobile phone via the Telegram app, allowing him to take action if there are lapses.

> Such a surveillance system, to complement manual inspections, would enable round-the-clock supervision, and reduce human errors that occur due to fatigue, said HDB. The project is in collaboration with the National University of Singapore's School of Design and Environment, with support from AI Singapore.

> Ms Ng Peck Nah, deputy director of Building Construction Management, said that the project could lead to higher construction productivity with fewer delays due to safety-related incidents.

> She added that HDB will trial the system later this month (Sept) in one of its Build-To-Order projects, Clementi Peaks. The trial is expected to end in the last quarter of 2020.

> HDB said if successful, HDB could potentially scale up the tool to cover other areas to enhance worksite safety, such as workers standing on vehicular pathways, and entering confined spaces without permission.

> USING DRONES FOR BUILDING INSPECTIONS

> HDB is also looking into using drones with its partner H3Zoom.ai for the inspection of building facades, to improve worker safety and reduce dependence on manual labour.

> Currently, workers are deployed on suspended gondolas to perform this task.

> The inspection of one block may take up to several days when done manually. In a pilot trial conducted at Yuhua and Sembawang from July to October last year (2018), the inspections took between a half day and full day to complete.

> Residents were notified in advance during the trials and the area below the flight path was cordoned off for safety during the inspection.

> The drone inspection system taps on a cloud software platform to conduct a visual scan of building facades captured during inspection.

> Using AI, the system is able to process thousands of photos to identify building defects and categorise them.

> The platform then delivers a report to highlight the severity of the defects and recommend possible remedies.

> While Town Councils are responsible for the maintenance of building facades of HDB blocks, HDB complements these efforts, auditing about 1,000 buildings per year.

> The necessary rectification work can be shared with the Town Council to help them in their building maintenance works.

> HDB said it will continue to refine the system to overcome limitations, such as when inspection involves entering building recesses and air-wells which could interfere with GPS signals.

> The presence of tree foliage could also hamper the clarity of images captured on lower floors.

> SINGAPORE — Flats in Tengah housing estate’s second district, called the Garden District, will debut in the Housing and Development Board’s (HDB) Built-to-Order (BTO) exercise this month.

> The launch of Garden District comes after flats from the estate’s Plantation District were launched in November last year. At about 80 hectares, the Garden District is expected to provide up to 6,500 new homes when fully completed, the HDB said on Monday (May 20).

> The height of its apartment blocks will be staggered to create the impression of “valleys nestled amid garden spaces”, and the flats will be oriented to maximise the surrounding garden views, said the HDB.

> All roads in the district will feature 2m-wide dedicated cycling paths and 1.5m-wide pedestrian paths.

> The district will be near a future MRT station on the Jurong Region Line, and most bus stops will be within 300m of residents’ homes.

> Each flat will be equipped with data points and additional power points to enable the adoption of smart home devices.

> Offering a preview of what potential homebuyers can expect, the HDB said a recreational corridor with about 3,000 sqm of community and allotment gardening will be a key feature of the district.

> One end of the corridor – dubbed the Garden Farmway – will lead to the Tengah Pond, which will have retail and recreational facilities along the waterfront. The other will lead to a 20-hectare park, which will serve as a buffer between homes and the future Jurong Innovation District.

> The first housing project of Garden District that will be launched for sale is Garden Vale@Tengah. Together with a second project in Plantation District, more than 2,000 flats will be on offer.

> The flats will range from 2-Room Flexi to five-room units.

> At the BTO exercise last November, flats in Tengah were priced (excluding grants) from S$101,000 for 2-Room Flexi units, to S$423,000 and above for three-generation units.

> All types of units were oversubscribed.

> The application rate was 1.7 for 2-Room Flexi units, while four-room flats were the most popular, with an application rate of 4 as of Nov 19 last year, according to HDB’s website.

> At 700 hectares, Tengah estate will be roughly the size of Bishan town and yield about 42,000 homes when fully developed.

> The estate will have a 5km forest corridor that is about 100m wide.

> It connects the Western Catchment Area and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, and nature conservationists have called for more land to be set aside as a refuge for animals including uncommon birds and mammals.

As for the reporting location, the pass office should be able to help you/call the right people.

Tengah is a full red zone across the whole camp, and they take it seriously.

Yes, it's possible to take leave after the course, but like all units you have to co-ordinate with your fellow drivers and your superiors due to having duty driver schedules. Two weeks of leave, and I think they have off-in-lieu for duty as well (or at least that was the case when I was there last year for my reservist).",t3_bdpl5p,16-04-2019

Disclaimer, I was a security trooper in TAB like 2 years ago so I only have limited information about your vocation.

Reporting time should be given to you along with your Point of Contact before the end of today, but most of the time will be at the pass office waiting for someone to bring you in. You can search Tengah Air Base Entrance on Google Maps and it's the blue building with the blue windows, either wait outside or you can ask the pass office to contact someone, if you are still waiting past the meeting time.

TAB is a fully red zone. However unlike what the other's have posted they allow camera **DISABLED** phones. Meaning you can bring your phone to a phone shop to physically remove the camera. Or you can sandblast your camera lens. Just as long as both front and rear cameras are unable to take any photos. If you sandblast they can ask you to open the camera app to test on a letter 'A' printed on A4 sized paper. They may allow you to use the phone lockers but I believe they stopped that practise for all base personnel due to lack of lockers.

I seriously recommend getting your old phone and disabling the camera to use in camp, instead of using a camera-less phone or attempting to smuggle it in. Camera lock apps are obvious as hell, if that's what /u/stlailiaolo was suggesting. Not worth getting caught over a phone

You might need to take a airfield permit course after your drivers course to be allowed to drive on the runway areas.

1) Yes. Your unit will contact you about where to go. Ask if you dont know where to go.  If you are posted to the MT line, it is pretty easy to find.

2) From a friend who was posted to the MT line, no. Unless you are posted to one of the other units and they use the vehicles as a personal taxi 

3) Yes there is a higher chance since the passing conditions for drivers is much harder.

4) Can be as short as about 1 month as long as 3.

5) No, you cannot request for a transfer. Even if you do, they will just ignore. If you really dont want to be a driver, just claim night blindness.

6) Red. Food is normal if you eat at the cookhouse. Bad if it is delivered to you. Canteens are really far away though so either you walk a lot, drive there or dont go.

7) You are entitled to your 12-14 days of leave, cannot remember exactly how much, subjected to the approval of your superior. You cannot take it during the course but you are free to request for it once you are done with your course.",t3_bdpl5p,16-04-2019

I can't speak specifically for driving there, since I never did, but the one thing you will definitely master in your time there is going up and down steep inclines. Seriously. There's slopes EVERY. WHERE.

The food there is generally okay. Cookhouse has good food 90% of the time. In the event it's terrible, there's a canteen near the main entrance. I haven't been in there in a couple years, so some things may have changed.

A driver, from my BMT cycle at least (they changed it recently), was considered a combat service support vocation (old PES C) while ASAs and SAGE are mostly considered service support vocations (old PES E). While it is definitely possible to be posted as ASA or SAGE from a combat service support PES, it is not common.
