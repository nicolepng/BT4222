185,1,f9xy9y7,t1_f9x1dgs,"Fair enough. I like teal/orange look too, but some film directors over-rely on them. A perfect blend would be to leave outdoor/bright scenes unfiltered, and apply the orange/teal look only for indoor or low-light scenes. This combo works for me.

I was quite disappointed to find a few movie re-masters overly filtered also. They take away that nostalgic/vintage look of the 80s and 90s. It's probably due to my personal bias. The first version of songs or movies that I experience becomes the definitive version, which makes me not receptive to re-imagined or cover versions.

Case in point: Hotel California. I tried forcing myself to listen to the studio version, multiple times. But I still prefer the [Hell Freezes Over](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x30pss5) version. Because I heard that one first. Stupid bias at work.",t3_e78fga,07-12-2019

However, I do need to point something out as one or two commenters in this topic called it out -- I'm not Singaporean. I'm not even a permanent resident, even though I have called Singapore my home for the past 4 years. I never claimed otherwise. I love this city, and there are so many amazing stories about this place and its history I want to share with a wider audience with great care. Local history, folklore and culture is a large part of the game, even if the plot spans the entire world. I see so many of you say something along the lines of 'let's support local', and it's so great, but at the same time, the truth is, I'm not local and feel I do not deserve that kind of support. So instead, I choose to interpret it as 'let's support a game that finally puts Singapore in the spotlight', and I can totally get behind that. I think it's time to make a game about Singapore, period (even if it's a cyberpunk future version of it!).",t3_dfzdot,11-10-2019

Whenever I want Laksa, I just mix 50/50 coconut milk and chicken broth and add the Laksa paste cubes to  taste. If you end up adding too much, just add more 50/50 coconut milk & broth. No such thing as too much Laksa. Add a touch of lime juice and fish sauce to your liking. Add whatever other Laksa ingredients you like- prawns/shrimp, mussels/ cockles, tofu puffs, bean sprouts, coriander/cilantro, whatever you want. Then add the cooked noodles of your choice. BLAM! LAKSA!

It may not be the Laksa of your dreams, but since you are in control you can tweak it anyway you want. To successfully tweak it, make sure to take notes of what you are doing. Over time, you‚Äôll find your own style and then it will be the Laksa you and your family will crave. 

LAKSA PASTE

Stick it all into a food processor until it‚Äôs a paste. If you don‚Äôt have a food processor, you‚Äôll need a mortar and pestle. I will usually make 5x-10x the amounts and freeze in ice cube trays. 

60 g red shallots finely chopped

4 g fresh bird‚Äôs eye chillis

20 g garlic sliced finely

10 g long dried chillis deseeded & soaked

25 g candlenuts can be substituted with macadamia nuts

15 g lemongrass white part, sliced finely

10 g galangal finely chopped

10 g fresh turmeric finely chopped

20 g belachan shrimp paste, roasted*

5 g turmeric powder

5 g coriander powder

30 g dried shrimp soaked until soft

Then we were arguing over whether to wear masks - ppl were saying we should be like taiwan/korea n wear mask, others calling them koreaboo, ppl citing WHO guidelines to only wear masks if sick. Blabla. Even the freaking negative ion masks were already out and being sold by my relatives. 

I actually kinda liked cny last year because there wasn‚Äôt much questions about ‚Äúwhat are you doing now‚Äù/‚Äúgot bf alr or not‚Äù and whatever other invasive personal questions i hate, since everyone was so preoccupied with talking about this potential new virus from china lol.",t3_lekdio,08-02-2021

1255,1,gmgac0h,t3_lekdio,"""So, it's a very difficult decision. If we don't issue mask, and if we don't issue surgical masks, everybody scold us.
Everybody say that we don't care.
If we still issue surgical masks, and give everybody surgical masks just to make them feel¬†shiok shiok, because they saw Carrie Lam wore masks right, at the conference right, everybody must wear mask right?
Today you see newspaper? What is happening to Hong Kong now? What did¬†South China Morning Post¬†just report about Hong Kong?
They are down to less than one months' supply of masks for their medical people.
Which means that when the medical people don't even get the masks you think they dare to go and take care of the sick people?
If we have done what we have done like Hong Kong without thinking, and ask Carrie Lam, PM, myself, Lawrence Wong, Gan Kim Yong go to press conference everyone wear a mask, today everybody panic.
I can guarantee you, today our hospital system would have broken down.
They would be no more surgical masks for our hospital people because people would have all used up like tissue paper.
If every Singaporean used a surgical mask, one day we would burn 5 million surgical masks, if not more.
And since we don't know how long we got to fight this war right, and the supply lines are cut already right, how long must we conserve the surgical masks to make sure that our medical system still can work?
It could be three months, it could be six months, correct?
You all now understand the difficulty?
But then we have a problem.
Because everybody is clamouring for a mask.
And we know that the surgical masks will all be wasted and we will end up like Hong Kong one of these days without masks for their medical workers.
So what did we do?
Can I be frank? We took a gamble. I took a gamble.
To calm the nerves, I distribute four to everybody to use only when you are sick and go to a hospital, to calm the nerves.
But to issue four to every family, I burn another 5 million masks from my limited stockpile.
When China now asks for masks right, China is burning at a rate of hundreds of millions per day you know?
Which country and which production line can even meet China's needs?
Cannot right?
I examine you know, go down to this level.
One machine, one machine, the three-ply one.
One month, 2 million masks. Max rate. One machine.
So we took a gamble.
Give people the masks. Damn¬†bua hang¬†like that.
Give you the masks. Don't¬†kan cheong.
Because first of all why use that mask when it is not community outbreak of that sort, when it is not proven effective?
Keep the surgical masks as much as possible to the medical people first.
And if the evidence proves so, my next line of people is not to give everybody.
My next line of people will be those at the front line: Drivers, service staff, or whatever.
So we need to prioritise and track.
So you can see right, I am having to do this literally like a military operation.
When to give masks to which group of people, tier by tier.
So we hear bus drivers concerned, taxi drivers concerned, we even think of how to save the masks like during SARS.
You know SARS you know we got no masks right?
Don't have enough of the N95 one, what did we do?
We literally wind down the window. Seriously!
But today the bus want to wind down window also cannot.
All air-con bus. See, First World Problem. (Laughter)
You tell me which bus can wind down window one? Your bus can wind down window one?
You find me one bus can wind down window, I'll bring the bus to the museum already.
See, so I hope you all understand, I'm being very blunt, being very frank, how we manage this thing.
Now, will we issue mask to the bus driver and the taxi drivers?
I'm thinking very hard now. Because I can issue you the haze masks if it is just a security blanket.
But I have to ask the same thing, how long must we last in this fight?"" -CCS 'xiasuay' speech",t3_lekdio,07-02-2021

> The Chinese New Year decoration outside Chinatown Point has come under the spotlight.

> Members of the public are speculating whether the mall is really going green by recycling, reducing and reusing -- by turning the mascot for the Year of the Rat into the mascot of the Year of the Ox -- by utilising a few finishing touches.

> It is an otter

> Shin Min Daily News reported that several readers opined that this animal sculpture below is not fitting for the Year of the Ox.

> A second sculpture has the ears and whiskers of a mouse, but with horns and a nose ring affixed ‚Äî like those on a cow.

> ""It is the Year of the Ox, but no matter how long I looked at it, I can't tell what animal this is,"" one reader told Shin Min Daily News.

> Some readers also told the Chinese paper that it appeared that the mall had recycled the decorations from 2020's Chinese New Year, which was the Year of the Rat, and added horns to make it suitable for the Year of the Ox.

> One reader said that she doesn't mind if the mall recycles decorations in the name of sustainability, but more work needs to be done with regards to the sculptures' aesthetic quality.

> Specially-designed by local artist

> In response to queries from Shin Min, Chinatown Point said that the animal causing mass confusion is neither rat nor ox, but an otter.

> The mall said that they chose to feature otters because these animals are well-liked locally.

> The otter sculptures were specially designed by a local artist.

> Chinatown Point added that these otter sculptures can be re-used for different occasions.

> ""We added caps and horns to the otters this year to celebrate the Year of the Ox but these 'add-ons' can be removed.""

> From Jan. 21 to Feb. 28, Chinatown Point shoppers can receive a limited-edition otter toy.

> Year of the Tiger mascot

> In response to the shape-shifting mascot, one person doctored an image of the otter to depict what it would look like in the Year of the Tiger:

> Chinatown Point subsequently clarified that the mascots are indeed otters:

> We would like to clarify that the mascots placed around the mall are in fact otters! We chose to incorporate Otters as part of our Lunar New Year d√©cor this year to signify a local favourite. We have commissioned Local artists to design this character specially for this campaign! As part of our efforts to support recycling, the localised otter mascots have been made such that they can be adapted for a number of campaigns. To tie-in with the CNY Year of the Ox, detachable elements such as horns and caps were added. As part of our Lunar New Year campaign (21 January ‚Äì 28 February) at Chinatown Point, shoppers stand to redeem exclusive gifts like the limited-edition otter plushies.

> Long-time CD shop Foo Leong Records located in Chinatown Complex Centre will be closing by the end of November 2019.

> Advertisement

> Demise of an iconic traditional record shop

> The 79-year-old shop owner, Wong Nam Thye, said she has always wanted to keep the shop going as she enjoys chatting with neighbours and old customers despite making losses in recent years.

> However, the old record shop has met its end after 54 years in business.

> It‚Äôs definitely not an easy decision to make for Wong as she told the Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao that she has built the shop from scratch and she could not bear to close it.

> The shop was named after her son, which means ‚Äúprosperity and good nature‚Äù.

> She added that the shop is her labour of love just like her child.

> Besides feeling sad about the shop‚Äôs closure, Wong also shared that she felt guilty towards her son who had spent much of his time after serving his National Service by helping out at the shop.

> As a result, he could not gain much work experience and has faced difficulties looking for jobs subsequently.

> Advertisement

> Making losses for the past four years

> Her business started out as a roadside stall at Pagoda Street before she moved to a shop space in Chinatown Complex in 1983.

> The business was booming in the 1980s, as records were a big source of entertainment then.

> However, CD sales at the shop have plunged since the advent of the internet.

> She has been making losses over the past four years and she can no longer keep up with the rental fee for the two units that the shop used to occupy.

> She even had to pawn gold jewellery from her dowry to pay for the rental fee, which was over S$1,000.

> In 2018, she reduced the space by one unit in order to cut down on the rental cost, but it‚Äôs still not sustainable.

> Advertisement

> Clearance sale

> In order to clear the stock at the shop, Wong has reduced the prices of the CDs.

> Prices have been cut from S$10 to S$2 for each CD, since two weeks ago.

> She is considering selling the remaining stock off with a one-for-one promotion.

> The promotion has drawn some hobbyists to purchase CDs and cassettes as collectibles.

> Knowing about the closure, many customers have also come to the shop to reminisce the good old times with Wong.

> SINGAPORE - An American commercial pilot, who breached a stay order in early April, was sentenced to 4 weeks' jail on Wednesday (May 13).

> Brian Dugan Yeargan, 44, who pleaded guilty to an offence under the Infectious Diseases (Covid-19 - Stay Orders) Regulations 2020 on Wednesday, arrived in Singapore from Australia on April 3.

> He was then issued with a 30-day short-term visit pass.

> The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) had said in an earlier statement that Yeargan was also served with a stay order and was not allowed to go out in public until April 17.

> Ignoring the stay order, he left his room at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport hotel on April 5 and took an MRT train to City Hall station.

> ICA added that he then walked to Chinatown Point shopping centre to buy some personal items, spending about three hours in all outside his room.

> Offenders convicted of the offence can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000.

> The Chinese New Year bazaar may have been cancelled, but that has not stopped crowds from thronging Chinatown during this festive season.

> When The New Paper team was there for three hours on Saturday, Trengganu Street, Temple Street and Pagoda Street were teeming with hundreds of shoppers who were all wearing masks.

> But safe distancing was simply not possible as many people literally rubbed shoulders on the packed streets and in shops.

> Also of concern was that only one shop in the area was seen enforcing SafeEntry protocol, which enables contact tracing in the event of a Covid-19 infection.

> When shown photographs of the scene, infectious disease specialist Leong Hoe Nam said with a sigh: ""Too many people. Exactly what the virus would want. I expected it. We have Covid fatigue.""

> The eight shoppers that TNP approached were confident that masking up would give them enough protection from the coronavirus that has blighted the world in the past year.

> One of them, who was with her husband and wanted to be known only as Ms Nancy, 58, said: ""I think it is okay and safe without social distancing because people are wearing masks.""

> Another shopper, Mr Hong, 47, who was with his wife and son, said: ""I am not worried because we are moving around and not trapped in one area. It is fine because people are wearing masks.""

> Dr Leong said while it is true that masks do provide some protection, the assumption is they are good quality masks that are used properly in tandem with strict hand hygiene.

> ""The mask is only as good as how you use it. Many wear it with their nose exposed and with big gaps by the side,"" he added.

> When approached, many shop owners and assistants either declined to comment or were defensive about the lax safety measures in the area.

> When asked about SafeEntry, a woman selling festive snacks kept asking if the TNP team wanted to make a purchase before she finally pointed to a neighbouring shop and said: ""There is a QR code next to our shop. It is the same if you scan next door.""

> At the only shop enforcing SafeEntry and temperature- taking, the owner who wanted to be known only as Mr Larry, 28, said: ""I am worried that there is no social distancing and customers are not keeping a distance from one another.""

> Mr Low Chek Liang, 58, who runs a shop selling Chinese New Year decorations, said: ""I am not scared even though there is no SafeEntry. If you have a strong immunity, there is nothing to be scared of. I think I have a strong immunity.""

> Last November, the Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng Citizens' Consultative Committee decided to cancel the Chinese New Year bazaar over crowd control concerns.

> But it has done little to keep the crowds away. On Saturday, three safe distancing ambassadors told TNP about the difficulties their team of 10 faced in trying to manage the crowds.

> DIFFICULT

> ""We have to make sure everyone is 1m apart and wearing masks, but since it is a weekend, it is difficult to control them,"" said one.

> ""We even activated teams from Orchard and other areas to come over and help, along with assistance from police officers.

> ""But we really need the full cooperation of the public.""

> The surge in physical interactions is highly risky, warned Dr Leong.

> ""If we continue like this, a super spreading event will occur. What made us safe previously may not be good enough for the next lap,"" he said.

> Dr Leong added that while we have managed to ""push back"" the virus in recent months, if we just ""maintain status quo, we will falter"".

> This is because the virus is adapting into new strains that are more infectious in places such as Britain, South Africa and Brazil.

> Meanwhile, complacency set in here with the more relaxed measures in phase three, likely contributing to a rise in community cases, he noted.

> Dr Leong expects a spike after the festive celebrations as ""we have a coming together of a perfect storm. Big gatherings, more transmissible virus, Covid fatigue"".

> Warning that the virus was ""coming back with a vengeance"" in several countries, he said: ""The vengeance reeked of death, illness and misery in Manaus, Brazil.

> ""They are having 'Covid deja vu'.

> ""One circuit breaker (in Singapore) is one too many. Nobody wants CB deja vu.""

Totally agree. Just like property too. My next door uncle (~50 yrs) want the property to go up while the younger son wants it to drop. 

So it's pretty tough job and no doubt about it but the bottom line is safety is more important than any other stuff. We did ban chewing gum due to safety, and productivity reasons. Doubt the ministers are more accommodating these days instead of ruling with an iron fist",t3_7taxg6,27-01-2018
1676,1,dtbe3p2,t1_dtbbgew,"We already have all the necessary legislation, infrastructure and law enforcement in place to deal with errant drivers. Compare that to PMDs, where any Ah Kow, Ah Mud, Ang Moh or Ah Neh can just buy one off the shelf, charge it up and start riding willy nilly at 60km/h. No driving theory or practical course needed. No need to register with gahmen, pay COE or buy insurance. The PMD doesn't need to undergo any inspection for road-worthiness, no need yearly inspections too.

If they get into an accident with a pedestrian or another vehicle, good luck for the injured parties to get any reimbursement for their medical bills and/or damaged belongings/vehicle. If the PMD rider gets convicted for a serious offence resulting from an accident he caused, he can still own or operate one even after he gets out from jail. Drivers don't have that luxury, they usually get banned from driving for an extended period of time if they get involved in a serious traffic offense and this is a huge disincentive for them to avoid accidents at all costs. 

Right now, it is insanely cheap in monetary terms and other hidden costs as highlighted above for anyone to own a PMD compared to a small cc motorcycle. Both effectively have the same characteristics, the only difference is that one is subject to none of the legislative requirements that is imposed on all vehicle owners and has no age limit to ownership. 

For the reasons above, I seriously think the gahmen should consider banning PMDs. We already have that option of last-mile connectivity from the 3 big bike-sharing companies, not to mention Uber/Grab.

Ouch... I can almost feel the edginess there. Here is the rub - most people can't afford to pursue their passion as the main thing they do with their time if it does not pay the bills. That is why we have hobbies and a life outside work. 

Besides, note that the lady has a son and presumably other grown up children, etc. It is not written in the article but she probably receives some form of support from them which allows her to continue running the shop. 

> There is a huge revival of vinyl music - mostly driven by hipsters & nostalgic older folks. Record players are back and lots of younger folks are learning to appreciate how music sounded like, on vinyl. 

The trend is pretty minuscule and largely driven by disposable income + a desire for a more intimate / different experience. Having gone down that path myself for a short time (and fallen out of love with it), vinyl - especially vintage stuff - is actually pretty poor in terms of audio quality. 

If anything, I hope the lady gets more visitors to her shop now that more people know where she is. ",t3_9zesra,22-11-2018

In the original comment, the person used 'rat racing' as a term to verbify 'the act of being caught up in the rat race' , which doesn't make sense cause 

1) no one uses this term

I am still waiting to hear your riposte on the 0.3% difference in English literacy between the Chinese and Indians I brought up. Oh, and the even bigger issue of how this data is irrelevant to begin with because it is not scoped to the elderly.

Let's break down your second assertion now and systematically go through them.

1. _""There is a sizeable non-Tamil speaking, non-Tamil minority amongst Indians comprising almost 40+%""_

- Wrong. You are making the same mistake I alluded to in my earlier reply. Yes, 46% of Indians in Singapore are non-Tamil. That does not mean that they do not speak Tamil! An example would be a Ceylonese (non-Tamil) who speaks Tamil. Goodness! Do you have Chinese relatives who speak languages other than Mandarin? Now it is MY turn to ask you whether you are Singaporean or not.

2. _""Going by the fact that only less than 10% of Tamil speakers can speak Tamil only, if we apply this to the Others category, in this case being Hindi only""_

- Same mistake as above. There may be a significant number of Hindi speakers who speak Urdu, Gujarati, Marati, Sindhi etc. and NOT English. It seems that the longer we go on, the more assumptions you make.

Now, for your last assumption:

I go to Chinatown literally every week, even more frequently than I go to Little India. But that is besides the point. You could be living there day-to-day and still massacre data to this extent to support a point that frankly, you have no robust evidence for.",t3_j6oz0h,07-10-2020

You: This paper which looks at 15+ y.o and not just the elderly, says that in 2015, amongst Indians (54% of which are Tamils), just a meagre 3.6% could speak Tamil only! This means that the vast majority of Tamils can speak English!

Me: No. You have assumed that the remaining 96.7% can speak English just because 3.6% speak Tamil only. Wrong, wrong, wrong. They could be speaking Tamil + Malay, Tamil + Malayalam, Tamil + the language of the Gods.

Now you add oil to fire and quote page 16 (one page before page 17 from which I drew these statistics). Page 16 my sweet, summer child, is even worse. Page 16 shows us that the General Literacy is 96.5% for the Chinese and 97.3% amongst the Malays and 98.3% amongst the Indians. How is this compatible with your primary premise of ""The Chinese Elderly are much less English-literate than the Indian Elderly and Malay Elderly""?

I think if there's one thing we can agree on, is that prolonging this painful discussion is not going to be productive for either of us. Government just gave us a SkillsFuture top-up. Might want to jump on that DataScience bandwagon and take up a 101 course, or really, just question all these baseless assumptions about the data presented in this irrelevant source.",t3_j6oz0h,07-10-2020

‚ÄúThe ability to read, write, and speak in English, and to compute and solve problems at levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job and in society, achieve one‚Äôs goals, and develop ones knowledge and potential‚Äù    


Source: [https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/health-literacy/44055](https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/health-literacy/44055)  


Unfortunately the SingStat source does not define General Literacy. But I will accept that from the way the data is presented, it seems to suggest that it means literacy in any one language. Even if we accept that General Literacy = Literate in 1 Language or more, regardless of what that language is, the data still cannot support your premise. This is because to find out the %Non-English Speakers from any racial demographic, you must subtract %English Speakers and %Others Speakers from the %Literate in One Language Only. Why? Because some ethnically Chinese people speak Malay only and some ethnically Tamil people speak Malay only, amongst various other permutations. The data simply is not sliced in a way that is conducive for your premise.

Speaking of back alleys in Rome -- when I was there, I came across this 24h bakery that was hidden deep within a nondescript building near a metro station whose name escapes me (this was 3 years ago).

I remember peeking inside the building from the curb when a lady, who seems to know what I was looking for, signaled me to go further inside.

As I walked inside the building, I saw a huge door with what appears to be a pastry kitchen behind it -- lots of sheetpans in lots of racks, each littered with freshly-baked pastries. And that unmistakable smell of baked goods.

I walked through that door and approached one of the bakers, who seemed to understand little to no English, and so I resorted to point at what I want and signaled how many of those I wanted with one hand, almost like ordering cai png. I believe I bought like 10 pastries, each at 60 cents IIRC.

> SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 18 new COVID-19 cases on Friday (Feb 12), including two cases in the community who are linked to the Chinatown Complex stall owner who had earlier tested positive.

> There were 16 imported cases, who were placed on stay-home notice upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving their notice, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its update.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The two new community cases are the Chinatown Complex stall owner's 33-year-old son and 62-year-old wife.

> The 66-year-old stall owner and his other son, 32, were reported as COVID-19 cases on Thursday.

> The four of them form a new cluster linked to the stall owner, identified as case 60138, said MOH.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The 33-year-old son, who is unemployed, was identified as a close contact of case 60138. He was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on Feb 10.

> The Singaporean man was tested for COVID-19 on Feb 11 even though he was asymptomatic. His test result came back positive on the same day, and he was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) by ambulance.

> His serology test result has come back positive.

> The stall owner's wife, a homemaker, was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on Feb 10 when case 60138 was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection.

> Advertisement

> The Singaporean woman was tested for COVID-19 on the same day even though she was asymptomatic. Her test came back positive on Feb 11 and she was taken to NCID in an ambulance.

> Her serology test result came back negative, indicating that this was likely a current infection.

> Epidemiological investigations are ongoing, said MOH.

> 

> EFFECTIVE CONTACT TRACING KEY: MOH

> All the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine.

> They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that asymptomatic cases can be detected.

> MOH said it will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.

> ""Effective contact tracing is an important enabler to ringfence community transmission,"" added the ministry.

> MOH noted that both stall owner's wife and 33-year-old son do not use the TraceTogether app, and while they both have TraceTogether tokens, they did not carry their tokens with them.

> ""Individuals are reminded to turn on their TraceTogether app or carry their TraceTogether token at all times so that we can quickly identify and isolate the close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and limit further infections,"" said MOH.

> Two supermarkets within shopping malls in Pasir Ris were added to MOH's list of places visited by COVID-19 cases during their infectious period.

> The NTUC FairPrice at Pasir Ris West Plaza was visited on Feb 3, Feb 6 and Feb 10, while the Sheng Siong Supermarket at Elias Mall was visited on Jan 29, Feb 5 and Feb 9.

> 16 IMPORTED CASES

> One of the imported cases, a long-term visit pass holder who arrived from Indonesia, arrived from Indonesia on Nov 26 last year and served stay-home notice at a dedicated facility until Dec 10, said MOH.

> His swab done on Dec 6 while serving his notice was negative.

> He was asymptomatic and was detected when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on Feb 10 in preparation for his return to Indonesia.

> His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, although the Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load.

> His serological test result has also come back positive.

> ""He reported that before his trip to Singapore, he had interacted with his sibling in Indonesia who was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection in October 2020.

> ""Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others,"" said MOH.

> Three permanent residents who returned from India and Indonesia were also among the 16 imported cases.

> One imported case is a dependant's pass holder who arrived from the UAE.

> There were also four work-pass holders who arrived from Myanmar, the Philippines and UAE among the imported cases.

> The remaining seven imported infections involved work permit holders who arrived from India, Indonesia and Myanmar. All except one of them are domestic workers.

> 11 MORE CASES DISCHARGED

> MOH said on Friday 11 more COVID-19 cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. A total of 59,569 patients have fully recovered from the infection.

> There are now 31 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most of whom are stable or improving, with one patient in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Another 148 cases are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> 

> 

> 

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday said the bulk of Singapore's economy is expected to recover this year after last year's drubbing from the COVID-19 pandemic.

> Some sectors - such as transport, tourism and aviation - may take a longer time to do so, Mr Lee told reporters after visiting Singapore Airlines and Changi General Hospital staff members on the first day of Chinese New Year.

From the research done by NCID, MOH discharges people who continue to test slightly PCR-positive 21 days after their first positive test assuming symptoms have resolved.

Eventually, the world will reopen, and naturally, infections will happen again. The vaccine isn't 100% and some people can't get it because of allergies or preexisting conditions. However, we can manage the risk while opening up by slowly relaxing lockdown restrictions, rather than suddenly returning to 2019. Some people will still get sick, but we won't have a US or Europe style uncontrolled spread if we maintain some social distancing and vaccinate quickly. This way, the economy can still keep running, and the citizens can mostly resume our daily life.

New Zealand and Australia have a mostly self-sufficient economy and can survive as a hermit for years until their population is vaccinated. We rely on foreign workers to supplement our workforce, and foreign trade to supply our basic goods. Locking down completely will cause companies to close, jobs lost, and ultimately more suffering for workers. Once again, risk management is key.

> Turn off the Chinese New Year light-up over the weekend? Check. Put in new crowd control measures. Check.

> A lot can change in a week, such as the introduction of the above measures to reduce crowding in Chinatown's shopping precinct after The New Paper reported on shoppers ""rubbing shoulders"" in packed streets and shops two Saturdays ago.

> What has not changed so much is the crowding in Trengganu Street, Temple Street and Pagoda Street in the wake of the new measures.

> Though the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) estimated a 20 per cent drop in the crowds compared to the previous Saturday, many people were still too close for comfort in safe distancing terms.

> In fact, some of them told The New Paper that they had gone to Chinatown because they expected the new measures to reduce the crowding.

> Housewife Tan Mei Sin, 42, who was there with her husband and their three young children, said they wanted to take in the Chinese New Year atmosphere.

> ""It's an annual must-do for our family and Chinatown is the best place to come and feel festive.

> ""Things are already so gloomy. We can't even go to Johor Baru to shop for new year goodies. We decided we would spend about an hour here, have dinner and then leave.""

> Madam Tan was not alone. Of the 24 people who spoke to TNP, 11 said they were in Chinatown primarily to soak in the atmosphere. Or as one put it, ""just come to feel the vibes"".

> The new crowd control measure were announced by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) last Friday to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

> Apart from suspending the light-up over the weekend, they included closing the up-riding escalator at Chinatown MRT station exit A from time to time to manage passenger flow into Pagoda Street.

> The MSE also urged the public to adapt their Chinese New Year celebrations to ""protect vulnerable members in our community, such as the elderly"" and be socially responsible to prevent a resurgence in community transmission.

> The Chinatown Business Association (CBA) said on Saturday that barriers were put in place and additional security staff and safe distancing ambassadors would be deployed in crowded areas.

> Mr Anthony Tan, 56, who was with his 76-year-old mother and their helper, said: ""I promised my mother I would bring her here... like in past years.""

> The technician added: ""But I made sure she wore her mask properly and sanitised her hands every time we moved from each stall. I find it hard to deprive her from enjoying the festivity.""

> Noting an estimated 20 per cent reduction in crowd size, Ms Serene Tan, STB's director for arts and cultural precincts, told TNP: ""We thank the public for their understanding and seek their continued cooperation to visit Chinatown during off-peak hours.""

> The STB also said last week that 34 people have been fined $300 each in Chinatown since Jan 15 for not wearing face masks or gathering in groups of more than eight.

> In the same period, 11 businesses in Chinatown were fined $1,000 to $2,000 for failing to ensure 1m safe distancing between customers and for allowing gatherings of more than eight people.

> Most of the shopkeepers approached by TNP said they were fine with the stepped-up enforcement.

> One of them, who wanted to be known only as Ms Jessica, 50, said: ""I think that it is better this way because I am worried too.

> ""Our shop received a warning for not controlling the crowd... With the (new) restrictions, it is easier for us to control the situation now.""

> A security officer for CBA told TNP there is a contingency plan to close off the streets if the crowds became unmanageable.

> When shown the new photographs of the crowds, infectious disease specialist Leong Hoe Nam said: ""Singaporeans are absolutely becoming complacent... but we can also 'share the cheer' by doing something else. Go outside of Chinatown and tone down the celebration, have fun without the crowds.""

> Noting that the ability to impose restrictions has its limits, Dr Leong said: ""Can the authorities police everything? I plead for common sense to prevail among the public.

> ""We all hate it when our parents nag us. And as parents, we hate nagging our kids too.

> ""I do hope the enlightened Singaporean will rise to the occasion instead of the 'kiasu'one.""

> Chinatown's Chinese New Year decorations have captured public interest again. And again.

> This time, according to 8world, the issue is regarding a typo for a common Chinese New Year greeting, ""ÂøÉÊÉ≥‰∫ãÊàê"", which roughly translates to ""May all your wishes come true"".

> A mis-stroke

> A character stroke for the last word of the greeting -- ""Êàê"" -- was placed on the wrong side of the Chinese character.

> The ""ÁÇπ"" ('dot') was placed on the left side of the character, instead of on the right.

> In an interview with 8world, an eagle-eyed member of the public, Lee, explained that he had noticed the miswritten character as it was being taken down by construction workers on Jan. 25.

> The misspelt character had apparently been up since Jan. 23, according to media coverage of the weekend's CNY light-up.

> It seems the typo has since been corrected, based on the latest Instagram posts of Chinatown's streets.

> Decorations under the spotlight

> Chinatown's ox-related decorations came under the spotlight earlier this month too.

> The animal farm-esque herd of ox statues made for a fun sight.

> Also attracting public attention are the otter-turned-ox mascot at Chinatown Point, which was mistaken for recycled Year of the Rat decorations.

For those who are not in the know, old scheme rental is below 1k all in. Branded big organizations will be in the range of 4k to 8k, sometimes plus GTO (gross turnover). New or newly renovated coffeeshops taken over by new boss will charge in the range of 3k to 5k all in. If 24hr license would be 1 to 3k more. 

For newly renovated coffeeshops, because their rent so high, usually only big franchises are willing to take the risk. This results in the same freaking boring brands in every new coffeeshop especially in new BTOs run by staff from China or Malaysia. 

So there you go folks. Blame the big boys for fucking up our food culture and prices. Personally, I see those franchise brands, I boycott.

One minor issue would be that you mostly use Cantonese terms when introducing local foods/concepts. Cantonese is hardly a lingua franca in Singapore, especially among the younger population, largely because of an old campaign against dialects. If another traveller were to read your post and ask someone on the street for the nearest dai pai dong, they wouldn't likely be getting anywhere.

> More measures to control the crowds in Chinatown will be put in place over the weekends, after it was reported that merrymakers have flocked to the area to soak up the upcoming Chinese New Year festivities, despite Covid-19 worries.

> The Ministry of Sustainability and Environment said the Singapore Tourism Board and other relevant agencies and business association partners will implement additional measures to better space out the crowds in Chinatown over the weekends.

> These additional measures include:

> 1. The Chinatown Chinese New Year street light-up along South Bridge Road, New Bridge Road and Eu Tong Sen Street will not be turned on from Feb. 5 to 7 and Feb. 11.

> 2. Visitors who wish to observe the street light-up are encouraged to visit during the weekdays, or to visit the Chinatown Festivals website instead for a 360-degree virtual tour of the Chinatown Chinese New Year street light-up, starting from Feb. 5.

> 3. To manage the flow of passengers entering directly onto Pagoda Street, the up-riding escalator at Chinatown MRT Exit A to Pagoda Street will be closed from time to time, depending on street-level crowd situation.

> - Passengers will be guided by station staff to alternative exits at Chinatown MRT.

> - Access control measures at Pagoda Street and Trengganu Street may also be implemented during peak hours over the weekends, so as to ensure sufficient space for visitors during the peak hours.

> - Visitors should cater for additional time to walk and queue in order to enter the busier stretches of Pagoda Street and Trengganu Street.

> 4. Other measures may be implemented for crowd management and visitor safety, depending on the ground situation, including the closure of Temple Street to vehicular traffic.

> Members of the public are encouraged to adapt Chinese New Year celebrations this year in line with tightened measures during the festive period.

> MSE said this will help to protect vulnerable members in our community, such as the elderly.

2287,1,e2ll3c5,t1_e2lgalu,Singaporean Chinatown is different from other Chinatowns around the world in that it doesn't really act like an enclave at all. In London or in San Fran or in Vancouver you could walk around the area and not see a single strand of blonde hair or even maybe hear a single word of English but here it's just not the same with all our racial harmony policies,t3_8ztlf4,18-07-2018

And then this is perpetuated by opportunistic, hypocritical corporations jumping on the retro bandwagon by organizing all those fucking stupid festivals like ‚ÄúUOB YOLO presents Keong Saik Carnival‚Äù. 

To UOB, if you really love retro, Singaporean heritage and ‚Äúold school cool‚Äù so much, why don‚Äôt you pay the lion dance associations, clan houses, old coffee shops a visit and help them cope with their struggling rent? So they don‚Äôt get forced out of their units and replaced by a hip foreign ‚Äúlifestyle and hospitality brand‚Äù (yes - Potato Head Folk).",t3_8ztlf4,18-07-2018

2291,1,e2qlk95,t1_e2lzfl7,"Chinatown in western cities was never developed for tourism. It was meant for local Chinese. Tourists visited these places to see the trade, the shops, what they sold, the concentration of Chinese and some unique things from that culture. Nobody with half a brain visits Boxhill to see the culture as it evolved in Oz. They go there for the food. The same with little India and Geylang. Nothing to do with tourism but tourist are keen to see the culture and Tourism industry capitalises on it. ",t3_8ztlf4,20-07-2018

A lot of Indian families tend to go at least on a monthly basis to stock up on specific spices, and foodstuffs that may not be widely available in ordinary supermarkets, or to buy religious and cultural items.

2294,1,e2oe0ro,t1_e2m3ste,"I‚Äôm sorry, but I have to mention that many of the old clan houses and old coffee shops own their own shophouses. Potato Head Folk, on the other hand, rents it. For F&B owners who have to cover rent, they have to reinvent constantly, keep up to trend and keep their customers coming. So yes, they look newer, but that‚Äôs because they have to in order for their business to survive enough to cover overheads.    
  
If you are the owner of your shop, you probably already paid off the mortgage in full long ago and can sit in a F&B model that doesn‚Äôt reinvent, doesn‚Äôt need to change. No landlord to answer to. I can attest to you that the ‚Äústruggling rent‚Äù problem, henceforth, is more prevalent in new shops/restaurants than old coffee shops. (That cannot be said for Tong Ah though, because it is their own family member who decided to sell their shophouse for $8mil in 2013, while the other relative who is running Tong Ah wasn‚Äôt ready to close his kopitiam business.)  
  
If you have been to Keong Saik Carnival AND then subsequently the heritage walks and talks for Keong Saik and Bukit Pasoh, you‚Äôll know that some of the associations/clans had open houses and talked about their history. Have you attended one?  
  
I‚Äôll admit that UOB YOLO is a damn unfortunate name, but that said, it is not so simple as hip=bad.  
  
Edit: last point to add - Keong Saik‚Äôs past reputation was one of vice. A handful of these brothels are still operating.

> As Singaporeans prepare to usher in the Year of the Rat, the mice have come out to play and celebrate their year as leader of the pack on the Chinese zodiac cycle, at Chinatown Heritage Centre (CHC).

> The centre, which offers visitors a look at how early immigrants in Chinatown lived in cramped conditions, will have ""mice"" scattered throughout its galleries for visitors to hunt, reminiscent of how the early settlers had to fend off mice almost daily.

> The Festive Mouse Hunt was launched last Friday as part of the Chinese New Year festivities.

> Visitors can look for tiny, handmade baskets adorned with pink flowers and an image of a mouse carrying a Chinese cultural symbol of fortune, like gold ingots.

> Inside each basket is an ink stamp, each with a different design inspired by Chinatown's history.

> Established in 2002, the CHC occupies three three-storey shophouses and within them are six galleries documenting Chinatown's history. After a revamp in 2016, its interactive and immersive features include ambient soundscapes and olfactory displays of opium and hand-rolled cigarettes, traditional Chinese medicine and spices.

> The centre hopes the mouse hunt will add another element of fun for visitors as they wander through its galleries and discover the life, culture and traditions of Chinatown's residents from the 1950s till today.

> Explaining the decision to use an old-school game rather than digital technology, CHC director Margaret Zhang said: ""We want to create a special place and experience at the Chinatown Heritage Centre where time slows down and even stands still, for people to reminisce the good old days, enjoy the simple joys in life and bond with family and friends.""

> Currently, there are 48 ink stamps, but as the year progresses, the CHC will add more stamps with new designs, in conjunction with Chinatown's events.

> These include well-known occasions like the Mid-Autumn Festival, as well as lesser-known ones like the Five-Footway Festival, which celebrates the rich heritage of the Chinatown Street Market in March.

> The CHC has also designed journals in two unique styles for visitors to collect the ink stamps. Last Friday, the journals were given to visitors for free but for the rest of the year, they can be bought for $1 at the CHC's museum shop.

> 

> Home-grown artist Glacy Soh (above) has collaborated with cheongsam designer Audrey See to create these three wearable pieces of art, in the form of cheongsams. ST PHOTOS: DESMOND WEE

> 

> The Festive Mouse Hunt ends on Dec 31.

> There is another project honouring a new year tradition from the past when buying new clothes was a luxury not many in Chinatown could afford.

> The CHC has collaborated with cheongsam designer Audrey See, 37, from cheongsam boutique The Girl's Kaksh, as well as home-grown artist Glacy Soh, 57, to create three unique and wearable pieces of art, in the form of cheongsams.

> Each pink and blue cheongsam was made from Japanese cotton by Ms See, and was hand-painted with gold paint and studded with tiny Swarovski crystals by Ms Soh.

> The project took two weeks to complete and cost more than $800.

> The three cheongsams will be on display at the CHC's museum shop until Feb 29. Each cheongsam will then be packaged with 20 complimentary CHC admission tickets and 20 Festive Mouse Hunt journals for a silent auction.

> The money collected will be donated to the Yong-en Care Centre, which supports disadvantaged individuals and families in Chinatown.

> The care centre's executive director Beryl Ng praised the collaboration, adding: ""This is such a heart-warming gift.""

> The public can submit a bid via a form available at the museum shop, or via an online form on the CHC website. The minimum bid is $500 per set.

> Said Ms Zhang: ""We hope to bring out the rich heritage of Chinatown through such new initiatives, and will be collaborating with stakeholders in the Chinatown community to roll out more of such integrated initiatives in 2020.""

> One of the stakeholders is Tong Heng Delicacies, which has been around since 1935 and specialises in traditional Chinese pastries, especially its famed egg tarts.
