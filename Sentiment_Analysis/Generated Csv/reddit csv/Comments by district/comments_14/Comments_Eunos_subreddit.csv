> SINGAPORE - As more than 1,000 Muslims gathered at the Abdul Razak Mosque in Eunos for prayer on Sunday morning (Aug 11), volunteers from the nearby Buddhist organisation Shinnyo-en Singapore helped to organise a partial road closure giving them more space to pray.

> It was the first time that Shinnyo-en volunteers have served as road marshals during congregational prayers on Hari Raya Haji, which is also known as Eid al-Adha, or the festival of sacrifice which marks the end of the haj pilgrimage to Mecca.

> ""There have been more congregants coming to the Abdul Razak Moqsue year after year, and some of them cannot enter the mosque,"" said the mosque's secretary Mr Syed Salleh.

> He noted that congregants would often end up praying on the pavement or road outside its premises, but this could be unsafe: ""We decided to apply for permission for a partial road closure this year.""

> When the idea was mooted at a meeting of the Kembangan-Chai Chee Inter-Racial and Religious Circle (IRCC), Shinnyo-en offered to have its volunteers man the roadblock during the morning prayer on Hari Raya Haji, he said.

> Mosque volunteers handled a similar roadblock during Hari Raya Puasa earlier this year, but that meant that they could not join the other congregants.

> But they did so on Sunday, when six Shinnyo-en volunteers stepped in to divert traffic from Jalan Ismail, in the private estate where the mosque is.

> ""We were so happy about that. It didn't occur to us that people from other races would be willing to help,"" said Mr Syed.""It gives our volunteers the peace of mind to do their prayers as well.""

> Ms Tan Pia Tiang, manager of Shinnyo-en, said: ""Singapore is a religiously diverse country but there are many commonalities and one of them is prayer. We understand how this is important to our Muslim friends and wanted to volunteer so they do not have to forgo it.""

> She added that Shinnyo-en is more than happy to continue helping out in future Hari Raya celebrations.

> Related Story 3,700 sheep arrive in Singapore for annual korban ritual across 26 mosques

> Kembangan-Chai Chee IRCC chairman Fazlur Rahman said: ""It's a small gesture, but it is very important and it touches the hearts of others.""

> It is not the first time Shinnyo-en has worked with a mosque in the constituency, he said, adding that last Ramadan, its youth volunteers distributed vegetarian porridge at Eunos MRT station and bus interchange with young people from the Darul Aman Mosque.

> ""Religious leaders already have platforms to communicate with each other. But what we need now are more ground-up initiatives where members of the community from various religious groups, especially the youth, come forward,"" he said. ""Beyond just tolerance or appreciation, we want them to feel comfortable doing activities together.""

> Kembangan-Chai Chee IRCC, which comprises representatives from religious and community organisations in the neighbourhood, was set up in 2011. It meets regularly to develop joint programmes for the community.

The guy was walking in the opposite direction as me and turned back to talk to me and his whole mannerism and talking seemed so casual I really believed his story? Same story of needing cash for the clinic and his mum is otw to pick him up later or smth. I offered to follow him to the clinic and to give him the cash if he paynow-ed me but he just kept avoiding those qns.  In the end I just left because I honestly didn't have any cash and I wasn't going to go withdraw any unless he paynow-ed me (which in this time and age, which youngster dont have la). 

To think I felt really bad not giving him any cash bc I genuinely believed him wtf. Thanks for making a post and flagging it up to other potential victims

to OP, sorry you had to go through this. we live and we learn. It sucks that someone took advantage of your kindness but I hope it doesn't deter you from showing kindness to other people in the future still, albeit more wisely. Generally as a rule of thumb, don't give money to people asking for it and offer to buy them food/bring them to the place to pay instead.

> The ‘mini-mart’ was made from a huge cardboard box, which was painted in blue and red.

> The structure was also decorated with other recyclables such as toilet rolls and food packaging.

> When Pritam visited, he said he ‘purchased’ ice cream from the little shop owner, Xin Ying:

> Here’s the video and caption in the post if you cannot see it:

> “Purchased an ice-cream from Xin Ying for two dollars. She runs a wonderful little shop selling sundry goods in the Eunos constituency of Aljunied GRC and is a most polite young lady. An ambassador for service excellence!

> 

> Daddy Ken shows the way for the rest of us fathers. Instead of turning to gadgets to occupy our little ones, a little imagination and a desire to spend quality time with our children can turn a box into a shop or a spaceship.

> However their CC collection point isn't Eunos CC, but rather at Punggol CC at Hougang.

> Which is not as close to Eunos CC for these residents.

> Other Bedok Reservoir residents in Blocks like Block 725, will also have to make a longer journey.

> Interestingly enough, the block right across the road from Bedok North Block 708, which will have to collect their tokens at Punggol CC, can collect theirs at Eunos CC.

> Constituency-based

> In response to queries from Mothership, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGG) and the People's Association gave this statement.

> “The allocation of CCs is based on the constituencies which residents reside in, and Tokens set aside for the CC are reserved for the residents in that constituency. To ensure that every resident who requires a Token will have access to one, we seek residents’ understanding to collect the Tokens from their designated CCs. All CCs will be open for Token distribution by the second half of December, and we will ensure that everyone who wants a Token would have a chance to collect one.”

> 敬爱的东海岸集选区选民，

Dear voters of East Coast GRC,

> 遗憾之后，再遗憾。1988年的友诺士集选区选举，选民几乎把工人党候选人送入国会。50.89%对49.11％。这是新加坡历史上，票数最接近的一次集选区选举。友诺士、勿洛、东海岸、部分马林百列/淡滨尼，变来变去，PAP就是要选民迷失方向。但是，工人党支持者的心永远没变。

It was a pity. In 1988's general election, voters of Eunos GRC nearly put the candidates of the Workers' Party into parliament in a vote of 50.89% to 49.11%. This is the closest result for any GRC in Singapore's history. Eunos, Bedok, East Coast, parts of Marine Parade and Tampines - changed time and again - the PAP wanted to disorientate voters. However, The Workers' Party's supporters would always remain steadfast.

> 2015年的大选，阿裕尼集选区只以微差 (50.95%) 获胜。

In 2015's general election, Aljunied GRC was won by a slim margin (50.95%).

> 2020年大选，工人党很可能只剩下一个后港单选区。

In 2020's general election, the Workers' Party may very likey be left with only Hougang SMC.

> 这是民主的倒退还是前进？这是选民的迷失还是觉醒？新冠疫情真的让我们都失去了方向，迷失在只知道向PAP拿救济，而没有考虑制衡、公平、监督PAP吗？

Would this be a step forward or backward for democracy? Would this be the voters losing their way or finally awakening? Has COVID-19 really caused us to lose our sense of direction, lost and knowing only to reach to the PAP to save us, and not considering balance of power, fairness, and scrutiny of the People's Action Party?

> 王瑞杰真的不可取代吗？接班总理的工作，其实尚达曼就可胜任。尚达曼现在处理就业问题，创造新工作。国家财政，尚达曼也胜任有余。为什么，非华人就不可以担任总理职位？

Can Heng Swee Keat not be replaced? The job of taking over as the Prime Minister can be taken up by Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Tharman is currently handling employment, creating new jobs. He is also competent in managing the nation's finances. Why is it that a non-Chinese cannot take over as the Prime Minister?

> 东海岸的立国和建国一代，为新加坡做出牺牲，我们才得以有今天的成就。但是，老一代人的生活可以过得更加好，更加有尊严。

The Pioneer generation of East Coast sacrificed much for Singapore in order to produce the success and results of today. However, the lives of the elderly could be better, and they could be afforded greater respect.

> 珍惜您手中的一票，国会有监督和制衡，才能制定出好生活，有尊严的政策。当然，这是也您为下一代而投票。政府制定的长远计划，经过制衡和监督将会照顾年轻人的未来，也确保他们的就业尊严和美好生活。

Treasure the vote in your hands. Only with checks and balances in parliament can we create a better life with dignified policies. Of course, your vote is also for the next generation. The long term plans of the government, subject to checks and balances will see to the future of our next generation, and ensure they will have dignified jobs and a better life.

> 东海岸选民在一定程度上知道人民行动党不是人民的爸爸，而是公仆。因此，即使受到疫情干扰，也要头脑清醒，再度支持工人党。同时，唤醒同区选民一起向PAP说不。王瑞杰是可以被替代的。即使他输了，PAP还是政府，其他部长可以顶替他的工作。

Voters of East Coast GRC know that the People's Action Party is not their father but their public servant. Hence despite COVID-19's influence, they will have a clear mind, and continue to support the Workers' Party. At the same time, they will rouse fellow voters of East Coast GRC to say 'No' to the PAP. Heng Swee Keat can be replaced. Even if he loses the election, the PAP will still form the government. Other ministers can take over his job.

> 遗憾了30多年，还要再等下去了吗？

After 30 years, is it not time?
