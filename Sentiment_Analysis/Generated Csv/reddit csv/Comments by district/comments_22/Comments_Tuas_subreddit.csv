6,22,gieyi9x,t3_ks6440,"The last few days, there have been some animal welfare groups appealing to cyclists to avoid this particular lamppost for some time. This is because there are a few Singapore specials who reside near there, that tend to be a little territorial when cyclists approach. As such, the groups have been appealing for cyclists to avoid it for the time being to give them some time to capture the dogs (the shelters are all running at full capacity now) before AVA takes them away and puts them down. This post by the Minister could not have come at a worse time for them, as it will likely attract more to visit and might cause further incidents. 

I hope all those who intend to visit this lamp post give the dogs a chance. They are just trying to protect their home.

> SINGAPORE: Three workers have died after suffering burns in a fire at an industrial building in Tuas on Wednesday (Feb 24), said Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Silas Sng on Thursday.

> Another five are in critical condition, while two workers have been discharged, added Mr Sng.

> Preliminary investigations have found that the accident at 32E Tuas Avenue 11 was caused by ""a combustible dust explosion"", said Mr Sng, who is also director of the Manpower Ministry‚Äôs Occupational Safety and Health Division.

> He added that the dust was in the form of potato starch powder, a material used for production by the company at the site, Stars Engrg.

> Mr Sng urged companies working with similar combustible materials to review their safety measures and ventilation systems to ensure that ""dust does not accumulate within an enclosed environment"".

Project IC is the name used in Malaysia to describe the allegation of systematic granting of citizenship to immigrants (whether legal or otherwise) by giving them identity cards and subsequently its current iteration, the MyKad. The alleged practice is centred in the state of Sabah in East Malaysia. The term is used mainly by the media as well as other political commentators and the general public. Another term used is Project M, the ""M"" referring to former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad due to his being allegedly involved in the spearheading of this project.The alleged object of Project IC is to alter the demographic pattern of Sabah to make it more favourable to the ruling government and certain political parties, especially with regards to changing the electoral voting patterns.

I agree that the current solution is cheap and easy, but that doesn't mean it's the best for society. It would be even more cost-effective to recruit only Chinese people without screening for health issues but there would be a guaranteed uproar if that became NS policy.

My case is that conscripting by fitness is more logical and effective. As I mentioned, there are plenty of physically fit women who would increase the effectiveness of our forces. With both genders available for conscription, the SAF would have the luxury of screening for psychologically suitable soldiers, increasing army efficiency and reducing the number of problem cases/suicides. Having more women in the army would be good for morale and in line with our constitutional values of equality and meritocracy.

I agree there is no easy solution but it helps to have a discussion rather than take the current situation for granted. The best solution is not necessarily the easiest or cheapest one but the one with the greatest benefit for society in the long term.",t3_a3nlxg,07-12-2018

399,22,ev3qdq8,t3_chzfqn,"It is not a traveling salesman problem.

It is a shortest path problem on an unweighted directed graph. Define your graph as such:

**1. Vertices are directional non-intersecting MRT line segments.**

Each segment of a MRT line that does not intersect any other MRT line gives 2 vertices, one representing each direction of travel. For example, The segment between Tuas Link and Jurong East has 2 vertices: one in the ""Tuas Link -> Jurong East"" direction, and one in the ""Jurong East -> Tuas Link"" direction.

**2. Edges are MRT line transfers.**

Each vertex *v* has an outgoing directed edge towards each vertex in the set *h(v)*.  Define *h(v)* as the set of line segments such that for each line segment *w* in *h(v)*:

* *w* starts at the terminating point of *v*;
* *w* has a different colour from *v*.

For example, the vertex for ""Botanic Gardens -> Bishan"" (call it *v*), has outgoing directed edges to the vertices for ""Bishan -> Choa Chu Kang"" and ""Bishan -> Newton""; but **not** ""Choa Chu Kang -> Bishan"" or ""Newton -> Bishan"" (does not start at the terminating point of *v*); **nor** ""Bishan -> Botanic Gardens"" or ""Bishan -> Serangoon"" (same colour as *v*).

**Problem instance**

For this problem the origin vertex of the shortest path problem is ""Tuas Link -> Jurong East"" and the destination vertex is ""Tampines -> Pasir Ris"".

**Algorithm**

Having constructed the graph, run breadth-first search for the solution. Time complexity and space complexity are linear in the product *b|V|* of the graph, where *b* (branching factor) is the maximum out-degree of any vertex, and *V* is the set of vertices. To reduce memory to be linear in search depth *d*, while sacrificing time due to repeated visit inefficiencies giving *b^d* in time, use iterative depth-first search.

Note that this graph has cycles. Note also that this formulation works even if LRT lines are considered.

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî A man was charged in court on Wednesday (23 December) after he was caught smuggling four kittens hidden in the crotch area of his pants while passing through Tuas Checkpoint last year.

> Justin Ng Chin Boon, 46, was handed four charges of causing each of the kittens unnecessary suffering in such manner of conveyance. His charge sheet states that he kept the kittens in cramped conditions with poor ventilation and temperature control such that ‚Äúthe kitten was exposed to (his) body heat during the transportation journey‚Äù.

> On 2 January last year, Ng, a Singaporean, was allegedly in the front passenger seat at Arrival Zone 2 of Tuas Checkpoint when he was caught. In a Facebook post three days after the incident, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said that its officers were conducting checks when they heard ‚Äúmeowing‚Äù sounds coming from a bulge in Ng‚Äôs pants.

> Ng also faces one charge each of importing the four kittens without a licence issued by the authorities.

> Another man who was allegedly driving the car, Leow Hua Liang, a 42-year-old Singaporean, was charged with abetting Ng.

> Ng was also charged over a separate incident on 11 August 2018, where he is accused of abetting a person known as Leong Sok Boy to import into Singapore seven cats hidden in a hand-carry bag and a plastic canvas bag placed at the rear passenger seat of the car through the same checkpoint.

> He is said to have assisted in trying to conceal the bags and failing to declare them to the inspecting officers.

> Alongside Ng, Leong, a 71-year-old Singaporean woman, was also charged with importing the seven cats without a license. Leow was also the alleged driver for this incident and was charged with intentionally aiding Leong with her alleged offence.

> Separately, Leow is said to have illegally imported an Oriental White-Eye bird by conveying it in a manner which caused it unnecessary suffering. He was handed two charges for the incident.

> Leow allegedly kept the bird in a zippered pouch, hidden in the driver‚Äôs door panel in a car that he was driving through Tuas Checkpoint on 5 January last year, three days after the incident involving the kittens.

> All three individuals will return to court on 27 January next year for further mention of their case.

> If convicted of importing an animal without a license, a person may be jailed up to a year and/or fined up to $10,000. For causing it unnecessary suffering, a person may faces the same penalty on a first offence.

When I was in NS, I was in Transport and more specifically handled the POL operations of the company, basically the petrol, diesel etc. I was involved heavily in multiple outfield exercises as the skid tanker operator. 

Now, the thing about SAF skid tankers of the 2010 era was that it was literally just a normal 5 tonner but they swap out the troop carriage for two big ass diesel tanks. It wasn't super customized to be skid tanker and was quite literally just like that, an existing vehicle repurposed for another different function. 

And because of how it was repurposed, it was a huge safety hazard. And by that, I mean whenever you had to top the big ass tankers up, you had to spiderman your way across the sides, go into the hot af back where all the tanks, pipes and whatnot are there and open up the hatch manually and put in the pump nozzle (same thing as commercial nozzles the ones at ESSO, Shell etc) and then climb back down and wait. Then when it's full, climb back up and repeat for the next tank. 

It was hot and slippery af. Very dangerous. If you skip and fall, you're definitely gonna break something. Nothing happened to me during my service of course but that's something I always thought of when people talk about 'safety'. There was no real safety. It was a horribly designed system and the only 'safety' SAF gave us was a fucking bag of sawdust which they told us to sprinkle on spills. This is the thing tho, the back is so fucking packed with the tanks and pipes and gizmos that it's impossible to sprinkle it all around. And the fact that the most dangerous part was the spiderman-ing shit at the sides which had a narrow footing to begin with. No. You got to make sure your footing and grip is solid af all the time. That was your only 'safety'.",t3_ltf1yj,27-02-2021

> The incident which occurred at an industrial complex ‚Äî said to involve a combustible dust explosion ‚Äî resulted in the deaths of three workers so far, with another five still in critical condition.

> The Inquiry Committee is expected to carry out a thorough study into the factors that led to the fire and explosion, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in a statement on Feb. 27.

> It will also make recommendations including policy, regulatory or WSH measures to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.

> The Inquiry Committee will be led by a district judge with two technical assessors, and its proceedings will be held in open court.

> MOM said that since the 2004 inquiry, it has ""worked closely with industry stakeholders to significantly improve workplace safety and health in Singapore"".

> Singapore‚Äôs fatal injury rate at workplaces reduced from 4.9 per 100,000 workers in 2004, to 1.1 per 100,000 workers in 2019, the ministry added.

> One of the most serious incidents in recent years

> Senior Minister of State for Manpower, Zaqy Mohamad, said in a Facebook post that the incident was ""one of the most serious workplace incidents in Singapore in recent years"".

> ""We cannot afford to let down our guard, because every life lost is a breadwinner and a loved one lost,"" he wrote, and urged industry stakeholders ""to continue to pay close attention to workplace safety"".

> SINGAPORE: Potato starch powder has been pinpointed as the source of a explosion at an industrial building in Tuas on Wednesday (Feb 24), which left three workers dead and injured seven others.

> Preliminary investigations have found that the incident at 32E Tuas Avenue 11 was caused by ""a combustible dust explosion"", said Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Silas Sng on Thursday.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He added that the dust in this case was potato starch in powder form. The company at the site - Stars Engrg - uses potato starch powder to manufacture its products, said Mr Sng.

> As of Thursday night, five of the injured workers remain in hospital in critical condition, while two have been discharged.

> CNA explains how potato starch powder - or other dust particles, including commonly found ones such as sugar or flour - can be an explosion hazard.

> THE ""DUST EXPLOSION PENTAGON""

> According to a Ministry of Manpower (MOM) circular issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Division in July 2015, fine particles can combust when all five elements of a ""dust explosion pentagon"" are present: Fuel (the combustible dust), air, dispersion, confinement and ignition source.

> (Graphic: MOM)

> ""It is a known scientific fact that ... materials in powder form can be explosive when it is dispersed over the air,"" said Mr Sng, who is also director of the Occupational Safety and Health Division, on Thursday.

> Advertisement

> ""Especially when they are in an enclosed environment ... with a source of ignition, you get an explosion, as you see in this case here,"" he added.

> ""RAPID COMBUSTION""

> In such dust explosions - which happen ""often but not always in an enclosed location"" - the fine particles that are suspended in air experience ""rapid combustion"", said the MOM circular.

> The damage left after the fire at 32E Tuas Avenue 11 on Feb 25, 2021. (Photo: Gaya Chandramohan)

> And what differentiates dust explosions from fires linked to a mass of solid material is the size of the combustible surface area.

> ""A mass of solid combustible materials will burn relatively slowly due to the limited surface area exposed to the air. However, when the same solid is divided into fine powder and dispersed as suspended particles in air in the form of dust cloud, the result will be quite different,"" said MOM in the circular.

> ""In this case, the surface area exposed to the air is much larger, and if ignition occurs, the whole of the cloud may burn very rapidly. This results in a rapid release of heat and gaseous products, causing pressure to rise.""

> Melted plastic outside 32E Tuas Avenue 11, the day after the fire at the industrial building, Feb 25, 2021. (Photo: Gaya Chandramohan)

> THINGS THAT ARE COMBUSTIBLE IN DUST FORM

> Materials that are combustible in dust form include organic matter, such as sugar, corn starch, flour, peat, soot and cellulose pulp, according to MOM's circular.

> Various types of chemical particles are also combustible, including ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) and sulphur.

> Metals such as aluminium, bronze, magnesium and zinc can also catch fire in powder form, as can plastics such as resins, melamine and polymers.

> (Table: MOM)

> HOW TO PREVENT DUST EXPLOSION

> The WSH commissioner on Thursday explained that combustible dust can be generated when powder is transferred, for example from a bag into a mixer.

> ‚ÄúOver time, the dust can accumulate in the environment, especially if the ventilation or the housekeeping is inadequate,‚Äù said Mr Sng.

> As such, dust control is one of the measures recommended to minimise fire risks.

> The MOM circular suggested having local exhaust ventilation systems that ""can capture dusts effectively to prevent unnecessary dispersion of combustible dusts where people are at work"".

> Such systems can be implemented at suitable locations where materials are loaded, unloaded or transferred, while ""taking care to not to have an extensive ducting network, which can cause burning materials to spread following an explosion"" within the ventilation system, said MOM.

> The ministry also recommended housekeeping and maintenance of dust collection system and filters, with vacuuming or wet cleaning methods preferred over sweeping methods. ""Sweeping would tend to cause more dispersion of dust particles,"" it said.

> Damage seen at 32E Tuas Avenue 11, the day after a fire at the industrial building on Feb 24, 2021. (Photo: Gaya Chandramohan)

> To prevent ignition, MOM said flame-proof equipment or non-sparking tools should be used in areas where combustible powders are handled.

> Operators should also ensure effective bonding and grounding of powder handling units to prevent the accumulation of electrostatic charges, which may lead to ignition when inadvertently discharged.

> Inert gases such as nitrogen can be used to reduce or eliminate the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere.

> MOM also recommended other measures such as providing explosion relief to safely vent the energy in the event of an explosion, installing detectors for sparks or glowing materials, and isolating areas handling combustible dusts from other parts of the workplace.

> And on top of providing training and refresher courses on combustible dust hazards, employers must equip workers with the right personal protective equipment such as fire retardant clothing and safety shoes.

> SINGAPORE: Ten people have died in workplace accidents in Singapore in the last three-and-a-half weeks, after three workers who suffered burns in a fire at an industrial building in Tuas succumbed to their injuries on Thursday (Feb 25).

> Speaking at the scene of the Tuas incident on Thursday, National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Melvin Yong raised concerns about the recent spate of workplace accidents and called on the authorities to address potential safety gaps.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He highlighted factors that may have contributed to gaps in workplace safety, adding that the recent fatalities are being investigated by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).

> The Labour Member of Parliament said he had highlighted concerns in December about companies that were rushing to complete work that had been backlogged since the ""circuit breaker"" period, potentially neglecting safety measures.

> ‚ÄúThere are also concerns about manpower adequacy for certain high-risk tasks due to safe management measures - for example, some work that is typically done by five workers may now be performed by fewer workers due to split-team arrangements,"" said Mr Yong on Thursday.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ‚ÄúWhat we are doing now is to look at each of the cases (and) work very closely with the Ministry of Manpower. Once we are able to identify what the gaps are, that's where we will have to sit together and find ways to address those gaps.

> ""If need be, we will have to impose measures to make sure that these accidents do not happen again,‚Äù he added.

> Advertisement

> Touching on the Tuas explosion, Mr Yong said that efforts are under way to reach out to the affected workers and their families.

> Ten workers suffered burns after an explosion at an industrial building in Tuas on Wednesday. Three of them have since succumbed to their injuries, while another five are in a critical condition. Two workers have been discharged.

> Preliminary investigations have found that the accident at 32E Tuas Avenue 11 was caused by ""a combustible dust explosion"", said Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Silas Sng on Thursday.

> ‚ÄúWe are all very saddened,"" said Mr Yong, adding that the Migrant Workers' Centre and Building Construction and Timber Industries Employees' Union (BATU) are working closely with the employers to reach out to the affected workers.

> ‚ÄúFor the three workers who have passed on, we are currently reaching out to their families to see what support they need, and what assistance we can provide,‚Äù he said.

> ‚ÄúFor burn injuries, they typically take a longer period to recover. But we‚Äôll do all we can to support the injured workers as they focus on recovery,‚Äù he added.

> SAFETY INSPECTION OPERATION EXTENDED

> In a Facebook post on Wednesday, MOM had said that its ongoing operation targeting high-risk industries will be extended until the middle of March following ‚Äúa spate of fatal accidents in February‚Äù.

> ‚ÄúMOM will be extending the operation to cover an additional 300 inspections up till mid-March 2021, with a greater focus on tackling the common infringements found of work-at-heights risk and safe use of machinery.‚Äù

> A total of 400 inspections were conducted between mid-December and mid-February as part of Operation Robin, which was launched following a series of workplace accidents in November and December last year.

> ‚ÄúThe operation uncovered 486 contraventions and issued 7 Stop-Work Orders,‚Äù MOM said. ‚ÄúTop offences include unguarded openings and open sides that present fall risks, and unsafe machinery practices.‚Äù

> On Thursday, however, Mr Yong said that structural changes are key to improving workplace safety in the long term.

> ‚ÄúThere's only so many inspections that we can do. I think what's important, and I've repeated many times, and I'll continue to call for it, is that every organisation should have a mandatory and dedicated WSH representative to focus on workplace safety, workplace health in each of the organisations,‚Äù he said.

> ‚ÄúI hope that we can do something about that, because today only very selected sectors have that as a requirement.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúEXTREMELY ALARMING‚Äù

> On Monday, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad had called the number of fatal accidents for the month - then at seven - ""extremely alarming"", compared to 30 deaths for the whole of last year.

> In a Facebook post, Mr Zaqy urged employers and workers to take a step back to reassess their workplaces and safety procedures.

> ""These incidents could have been prevented with adequate risk assessment of the workplace, and proper safety procedures in place. In particular, there were two cases where both deceased operated a boom lift and a forklift, even though they were untrained and unauthorised,"" he said.

> ""Contractors using such heavy machinery must ensure that only trained and authorised personnel are allowed to operate them. Keys to these machines should not be left unattended within the machines.""

> The seven accidents in February involved three workers who fell from height, three who were caught between objects, and one who was involved in a work-related traffic accident, said the WSH Council in a separate Facebook post.

> SINGAPORE: Cargo drivers entering Singapore from Malaysia via the Tuas and Woodlands checkpoints will be required to be tested for COVID-19 starting Friday (Jan 22).

> From 9am on Friday, COVID-19 antigen rapid testing will be progressively rolled out at the two checkpoints for cargo drivers and accompanying personnel entering Singapore, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Thursday.

> They will be allowed to enter Singapore if their results are negative.

> ""As cargo drivers and accompanying personnel could have interactions with the local community in Singapore, introducing an on-arrival (antigen rapid test) will allow us to identify potential COVID-19 cases and mitigate the risk further,"" said MTI.

> This will add to the safeguards ensuring public health in Singapore, as well as for the community of cargo drivers and accompanying personnel, the ministry said.

> ""We recognise the importance of ensuring the smooth passage of goods between Singapore and Malaysia and value the important role of the cargo drivers and accompanying personnel,"" said MTI.

> ""We will ensure smooth operations at the checkpoints to minimise disruptions to deliveries and supply chains.""

> Businesses expecting deliveries are encouraged to maintain close communication with their logistic providers and cater for possible delays, added the ministry.

> Businesses, cargo drivers and accompanying personnel must also continue to abide by safe management measures, including contactless delivery, wearing of masks and safe distancing.

> Advertisement

> Antigen rapid tests can return results within half an hour, according to the Ministry of Health.

> They have a lower accuracy rate than polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which take at least a day to return results.

Can‚Äôt we just do away with going through the motion? IMO, it‚Äôs just a CC (cover carchng) wayang act. 

Temperature too low/high, take again until OK especially those cheap unreliable machines.

Where do we let them wait? How about perishables waiting to enter SG under the hot sun? I mean there is a limit on how much earlier we can request all these Malaysian cargo drivers to reach SG earlier to make up for the ART waiting time. The travelling time for your vegetables coming down from Cameron Highlands to Woodlands already **take more than six hours**.

The worries are legitimate but there are no easy answers.",t3_l1wp16,21-01-2021

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî The Hume MRT Station will be opened by 2025 because new developments in Upper Bukit Timah and the Hume Avenue area now justify ‚Äúsufficient ridership‚Äù for it, said Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Transport.

> The move comes after residents living in nearby condominiums¬†called on the Government¬†to open¬†the station, which is located between the Beauty World and Hillview stations¬†along Downtown¬†Line. They had been doing so for more than three years.¬†

> Dr Puthucheary said that the ‚Äúshell station‚Äù at Hume was built during the second phase of the Downtown Line, which opened in 2015, and the pace of developments and ridership growth in the area did not warrant its opening at the time. He was speaking¬†at the parliamentary debate on the budget of the Ministry of Transport¬†(MOT).

> He also mentioned that the ministry¬†is now¬†studying other rail projects beyond 2030, which is when¬†Singapore's eighth MRT line, the Cross Island¬†Line, is due to be completed. Those other projects would be announced when the Land Transport Master Plan is launched in a few months‚Äô time.

> In the meantime, the districts¬†of Tuas South and Jurong Island will not get MRT stations, Dr Puthucheary added.

> On the opening of Hume station, he¬†pointed out that the new non-residential developments include the development of the Rail Corridor and the upcoming transformation of the defunct Bukit Timah Fire Station into a ‚Äúgateway node‚Äù for the surrounding nature and heritage attractions.

> Mr Desmond Lee, Second Minister for National Development, announced on Wednesday that the former fire station would serve as the base for visitors to explore Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Dairy Farm Nature Park and the former Ford Factory.

> Dr Puthucheary was responding to an appeal from Ms Low Yen Ling, Member of Parliament for the Chua Chu Kang Group Representation Constituency, to consider opening Hume station. She said that the¬†lack of an MRT station had inconvenienced residents living around there. Those heading to the city centre via Beauty World MRT Station were often subjected to an extended wait, because most buses plying Upper Bukit Timah Road were full by the time they reached Bukit Gombak.

> Not opening the Hume station, Ms Low said, ‚Äúeffectively leaves residents out‚Äù of the masterplan, which aims to build ‚Äú20-minute towns‚Äù where journeys to the nearest neighbourhood centre can be completed in 20 minutes. The plan also includes a ‚Äú45-minute city‚Äù goal,¬†where nine in 10 peak-hour journeys can be completed in 45 minutes by 2040.

> 

> Panel submits proposals to make transport journeys faster, safer and more inclusive

> 

> 

> 

> 

> The masterplan was the result of a set of recommendations made by an advisory panel.¬†Acting Transport Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said on Thursday that the Government had accepted the recommendations.

> As part of the masterplan, Dr Puthucheary said that the Government will¬†take the lead in building a cleaner transport system and that all public buses will be upgraded to use cleaner energy sources by 2040. ‚ÄúKey industry players‚Äù in the point-to-point sector, such as taxi firms and some private-hire car-booking providers and car-rental companies, have committed to having their fleets run on cleaner energy by the same timeframe.

> NO STATIONS FOR TUAS SOUTH, JURONG ISLAND

> While acknowledging that rail ‚Äúmust continue to be the backbone‚Äù of Singapore‚Äôs public transport network, Dr Puthucheary said that it is still important for MOT to ‚Äúcontinue to exercise financial prudence‚Äù in view of¬†the developments.

> ‚ÄúIn deciding which areas to extend our rail network to, we will have to balance between managing costs and benefiting the most number of Singaporeans possible, while taking into account the characteristics of each area,‚Äù he told the House.

> He also rejected a call by Nominated Member of Parliament Arasu Duraisamy to build a new MRT line to serve Tuas South and connect the mainland to Jurong Island.

> Mr Arasu¬†pointed out that several¬†businesses operating in Tuas South ‚Äî including companies dealing in biomedical parts, ship-building, electronic, logistics¬†and petrochemicals ‚Äî would benefit from an¬†MRT station. New businesses will¬†also spring up with the opening of the Tuas megaport, which is targeted for completion by 2040, he added.

> The area‚Äôs nearest MRT station is Tuas West station, which is 12km to 13km away, noted the general secretary of the Singapore Port Workers‚Äô Union.

> ‚ÄúThese are mainly companies with decent pay, decent work environment, and some even utilising state-of-the-art technologies. These are good jobs, jobs we want Singaporeans to be gainfully employed in. The challenge is, ‚ÄòHow do we attract Singaporeans to go there to work?‚Äô‚Äù Mr Arasu¬†asked.

> However, Dr Puthucheary said that the Tuas South area is still ‚Äúin the initial stages of development‚Äù and that there is not enough ridership in the near to medium term to support an MRT line.

> As for Jurong Island, he said that there are no plans to extend the MRT network to the island because¬†the future Jurong Pier station on the Jurong Region Line, which is planned for a 2028 opening, is located a short distance away from Jurong Island Checkpoint.

> Building a station on Jurong Island was ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù to add convenience or time savings. This is because¬†workers will¬†still need to go through a checkpoint and transfer to a last-mile shuttle to their final destination, since¬†developments are spread out across the island, he added.

> According to ELD's October 2020 release, the President directed the Returning Officer to retrieve the copy of the register of electors for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

> ELD said that the box will be opened at the Supreme Court for the register to be retrieved, so that a list of electors in PN23 who did not vote at the election can be prepared.

> The box will then be re-sealed and sent for destruction, together with the other boxes.

> Due to Covid-19, ELD will be putting in place safe management measures during the proceedings at both the Supreme Court and the incineration plant.

> This includes limiting the number of representatives from political parties who can be present to witness the proceedings.

> Sold above normal price to deter would-be profiteers

> The hand sanitiser was also sold above its normal price to deter would-be profiteers.

> The company also stated in their Facebook post that they would donate S$15,000 to The Courage Fund or any National Council of Social Service‚Äôs fundraising efforts.

> A Facebook post by Klenco-Singapore‚Äôs on Feb. 14 revealed these intents when it stated that a single five litre bottle would be sold at S$30 instead of its usual price of S$18.

> A Mothership reader who went down to the sale shared that he had queued for an hour and a half to purchase a bottle and gave an estimate of between 400 to 500 people in the queue.

> How effective is this product supposed to be?

> Neither the HIV nor the herpes viruses are able to survive for an extended period of time outside the human body.

> As such, this means that the viruses are unlikely to spread by say, sharing toilets, food, or bath towels.

> In the case of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) however, it has been found in an external environment, such as on the door handle of an infected patient in Wuhan.

> SINGAPORE - A localised power trip on Thursday morning (Aug 29) affected the immigration clearance system at Tuas Checkpoint, causing heavy traffic at the arrival and departure car zones for more than six hours.

> The disruption to the system happened at 6.45am, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in a statement on Thursday, adding that it resulted in ""intermittent slowness"". The automatic clearance system and the clearance systems for motorcycles and bus zones were unaffected.

> The ICA said the clearance system at the affected lanes progressively resumed from 8am. However, checks by The Straits Times of traffic webcams at around noon showed long lines of vehicles in both directions. The traffic appeared to have eased for departures at about 1pm, but there was still a backlog of vehicles waiting to enter Singapore.

> The authority said that at 11am, operations had to be temporarily suspended to secure a vehicle that evaded departure immigration clearance at the Malaysia checkpoint.

> More resources were immediately deployed to manage the situation, with officers on night shift remaining behind to assist in the clearance of travellers, the ICA said. One of the departure car zones was also converted to clear arrival cars when the system progressively resumed.

> The authority first warned about heavy traffic at Tuas Checkpoint at 7.24am, advising travellers to check the One Motoring website before embarking on their journey. In an update at 7.45am, it said the delays were due to an intermittently slow clearance system.

> Traffic conditions worsened, as the timing of the power trip coincided with the morning peak period.

> ""ICA regrets the inconvenience caused to travellers who have taken a longer time to clear immigration,"" the statement said.

> Frustrated motorists turned to social media platforms to post pictures of the jam at Tuas Checkpoint, with many saying they had been stuck in traffic for hours.

> Some netizens complained that they needed a toilet break.

> In another update at 10.45am, the ICA said Woodlands Checkpoint was experiencing heavy departure traffic as well. This was because of heavy backflow of vehicles from Malaysia. It is not known what caused the heavy backflow.

> Advertisement

> The move was in response to Malaysia‚Äôs reduction of toll charges for cars, buses and taxis at the Sultan Iskandar Building Toll Plaza (Causeway) and Tanjung Kupang Toll Plaza (Second Link) on Feb. 1.

> Revised toll charges

> Singapore‚Äôs revised toll charges are as follows:

> In addition, starting from Feb. 10, LTA will be rolling out a new digital service to enable owners of public service vehicles, such as buses and taxis, registered on Asean countries to apply for the Asean Public Service Vehicle Permit (PSVP) via the OneMotoring website.

> LTA said the initiative will make it more convenient for vehicle owners, and add to the suite of digital services currently available for foreign-registered vehicles, such as online application of VEP/Autopass Cards for foreign-registered cars and motorcycles.

> The application must be submitted at least seven working days before driving into Singapore, LTA added.

> When online payment for and delivery of VEP/autopass cards are available, vehicle owners can look forward to even greater convenience.

> Vehicle owners can refer to the online video guides on the OneMotoring website on the use of these digital services.

> Those who require assistance can approach LTA‚Äôs Service Centre at Johor Bahru, Malaysia, where digital kiosks are available for motorists to submit their applications.

> ""Upon further investigation, it was established that it was unlikely for workers from different blocks to have intermixed,"" said MOM. ""The stay-home notice for the unaffected block was therefore rescinded.""

> 

> MOM urged all dormitory operators, employers and workers to comply with strict safe living measures within the dormitories.

> Dormitory operators must ensure that the measures remain effective, while workers must comply with the measures and remain within their respective residential zones, said the ministry.

> This is so that if there is a COVID-19 case, only affected workers living in the same level or section, and not the entire block, need to be quarantined, it said.

> If you‚Äôre planning to travel to Johor Bahru sometime this month, be prepared to encounter long delays and heavy traffic at both Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints.

> Advertisement

> Expected delays and heavy traffic

> In a Facebook post on Thursday (Dec. 19), the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said that travellers should plan their journey when using the land checkpoints.

> Traffic flow through the checkpoints are expected to be heavy from Friday (Dec. 20) to Wednesday (Jan. 1).

> ICA added that the weekend before Christmas on Dec. 21 and 22 is one of the busiest weekends of the year so travellers are advised to adjust their travel plans where necessary.

> Here‚Äôs a screenshot of the causeway at 3pm.

> Here‚Äôs a screenshot of the causeway at 5.23pm.

> You can read the full Facebook post here:

> Check validity of passports

> In a separate news release on Friday (Dec. 20), ICA reminded travellers to ensure that their passports are valid before arriving at the checkpoint.

> All passports should have a remaining validity of six months or more.

> Passports which have been reported lost can no longer be used for travelling, even if they have been found.

> These recovered passports must be surrendered to ICA within 14 days and will be cancelled.

> Any attempt to use them is an offence under the Passports Act.

> If found guilty, you can face a fine of up to S$10,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years, or both.

> Failure to surrender the recovered passport is also an offence under the Passports Regulations.

> You may face a fine of up to S$3,000 or imprisonment for up to two years, or both.

> Travellers bringing in dutiable or controlled items such as eggs, meat products and potted plants should proactively make declarations to the on-duty officers prior to checks.

> Note that certain items such as firecrackers or chewing gums are prohibited.

> Foreign visitors can submit arrival cards online

> For foreign visitors, you are encouraged to submit your arrival cards online via the ‚ÄòSG Arrival Card‚Äô e-Service on the ICA website or mobile application for greater convenience.

> The electronic arrival cards can be submitted up to 14 days ahead of your arrival in Singapore.

> This means that you will only need to produce your passports for immigration clearance upon arrival.

> However, foreign visitors arriving via cruise liners and those entering Singapore to assume work pass status should continue to submit the paper-based disembarkation/embarkation card until further notice.

> Observe traffic rules and maintain lane discipline

> ICA advises against queue-cutting as it can cause severe congestion and compromises motorists‚Äô safety.

> Motorists are reminded to observe traffic rules, maintain lane discipline and cooperate with checkpoint officers to ensure a safe environment.

> Before embarking on the journey, motorists are advised to check the traffic situation at Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints through the One Motoring website or via the Expressway Monitoring and Advisory System (EMAS) installed along the BKE and AYE respectively.

> Motorists can also check ICA‚Äôs Facebook page for updates on the traffic situation at both land checkpoints.
