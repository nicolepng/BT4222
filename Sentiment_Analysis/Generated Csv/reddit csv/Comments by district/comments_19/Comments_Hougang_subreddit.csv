In Singapore, there really isn't a culture of keeping the environment clean, unlike in Japan where most citizens carry their own plastic bags on their person in case there aren't any trash bins nearby.

From my own experience, many would just toss their trash to the side if they can't find any trash bins nearby (Which is unlikely cuz there's like trash bins everywhere). I even had the experience of hearing a mother telling their young child ""Aiya just throw your trash on the floor, the cleaner will clean it"" (The trash bin was literally a few meters away).

Likewise for reusable cups at drink vendors - these seem to be the worst, at one place I was given a drink in one of those little plastic bags, in a plastic cup, with a plastic straw, and a plastic carrier bag to take it away in. Couldn't believe it.
One of the things everyone told me about Singapore before I moved here is how clean it is. It's not bad, but it has a lot of room for improvement.

> SINGAPORE - A bizarre brawl took place around 2am on Monday (April 29) between two men along Hougang Avenue 9, near Ci Yuan Community Club.

> Student Lucas Oh, 18, who was eating at a nearby coffee shop at the time, filmed the incident and posted it in a series of clips on his Instagram account.

> In one clip, a man can be seen swinging a recorder at another man, who retaliates by swinging a tall potted plant back at him as bystanders look on.

> Both of them appear to miss, and continue briefly before shouting at each other.

> In another clip, taken afterwards, the man with the recorder can be seen standing by the side and playing it - slightly off-key - as police approach him.

> Mr Oh later posted a photo of the man sitting on the ground with his hands behind his back, surrounded by police.

> A police officer appears to have confiscated the recorder.

> In response to queries, the police said that they were alerted to a case of voluntarily causing hurt at Block 930 Hougang Street 91 at 1.40am.

> ""The parties involved were advised on their legal recourse,"" the police spokesman said.

> Mr Oh told The Straits Times that the incident began after a staring incident between the man with the recorder and the second man, who was with a group of friends at the time.

> Both parties began shouting at each other but, according to Mr Oh, they appeared to not understand each other as they were speaking different languages.

> Mr Oh said that the man with the recorder then pushed the second man towards a potted plant.

> The latter then grabbed the plant and brandished it, and the two began fighting.

> Mr Oh said he did not know why the man with the recorder began playing it when the police arrived, but noted that he appeared to be drunk.

217,19,fxmqut5,t1_fxmdkyh,"Cause Potong Pasir is no longer under Chiam since 2011. I think he/she means those that are still under oppo.

It's sad.

Both LTK and CST left their strongholds Hougang and Potong Pasir respectively in 2011.

LTK managed to build the WP brand to exist outside himself while SPP remained largely a one-man show. Once CST left Potong Pasir in 2011 and never ran for elections due to health issues, Lina (his wife who ran for 2011 and 2015) and Jose Raymond (who ran for Potong Pasir in 2020) were unable  to capture back Potong Pasir.

Actually it's pretty amazing, if you consider how many parties in the past decades were able to win seats. And the amount of trouble WP went through in the last decade over stuff like CSJ is going through.

Unfortunately, I do feel like PAP is like SPP, in the way the succession planning has gone, and PAP largely feels like a one-man show. Although, to be honest, it feels like most of the things seem to be under LKY's directions, with the new additions being.... To put it mildly, chaotic.

When Jamus asked regarding the efficacy of the stimulus packages during the first presidential debate, you could clearly see Vivian not answering the question directly, but rather saying about reserves, productivity etc.

It's quite clear by now, that there needs to be an independent study of how useful certain policies have been, or else ineffective policies might undermine the foundations of Singapore in a chaotic global environment, especially post COVID-19. We can Ill afford to spend limited resources frivolously.

But I digress.

In short, I feel that LTK has truly been a great leader who can lead beyond his time. Thank you.",t3_hp5hq7,11-07-2020

> Workers' Party supporters are out in their usual force waiting, munching and drinking at the fabled Block 322 Hougang Avenue 5 coffee shop for the GE2020 Polling Day results to be announced.

> The famous coffee shop is being patronised by Workers' Party supporters, even though television and video screenings will not be allowed at F&B outlets under Phase 2 during this Covid-19 election this year.

> The Elections Department of Singapore had said previously that owners of F&B outlets should not screen political broadcasts, online rallies or other election-related broadcasts on their premises as they can draw crowds.

> But it appears that televisions blaring mainstream media programmes is not necessary to get WP supporters together.

> In the age of narrowcasting and social media, patrons at the coffee shop are keeping abreast about the GE2020 results individually through their own channels -- but doing it together.

> Here is look at the scene on the ground at 9pm:

> The crowd has traditionally been known to explode in a cacophony of sounds, such as guttural grunts, when the WP retains Hougang SMC.

> Cars honking, whistles blowing, flags waving, and tables banging are par for the course.

> Even before results are out as polling got extended till 10pm, the crowd is getting ready.

Right or wrong is entirely dependent on the position of the uncle.. if he is the caretaker of the stadium he may not be in the wrong entirely..

Cycling on tracks is prohibited and the officer of the stadium can and is empower to request for the person to  stop to prevent damage to the facility.
Yes it is a jogger stroller but the permission for its use would still fall under discretion of the caretaker of the stadium as he is still empowered to stop any person of the use of the facility to prevent damage

I was reminded of what happen back in my poly days and in safti when we wore track shoes onto hard courts.. we would be chased out or asked for our shoes to be removed to prevent damage to the waxed floor.

Additionally as someone else mentioned, i would think the damage from bicycles would likely be all the weight putting pressure via thin tyres on the floor (higher pressure, leading to uneven wear and tear on the tracks). A jogger stroller tends to have wider wheels, and the weight is lower, and more spread out (horizontally, instead of in the same line as a bicycle does).

If it was conceptualised a bit later, that park could have easily been called Seng Kang Park too (but purely just my speculation and musing).

To add on a bit of interesting history, Hougang was called 后港 (loosely translated to ""back port"") because it was located at the back of Sungei Serangoon. This is also why there's a ""Kangkar"" mall, ""Kangkar"" loosely translated to ""foot of the port"". Serangoon road was named also because of Sungei Serangoon. Today Sungei Serangoon more or less became Pasir Ris and Punggol, while what remained was diverted so that Punggol Road could connect to Serangoon Road in a straight-ish line.

This disgruntled group of Singaporeans formed the core basis of our opposition throughout 80s, and it was why the PAP could threaten the electorate that the opposition was lowly educated and unsuited to be elected, and was largely how LTK, CST, JBJ (as well as the two buffoons in Ling How Doong and Cheo Chai Chen) came into Parliament in that timeframe.

> One indignant father took to Facebook to share how a man allegedly hit his 12-year-old son while the latter was out cycling.

> Taunts boy to call the police

> Stanley Tan said his son first encountered the man a week ago on Nov. 13 when he went down to cycle on the park connector around Hougang Ave 8.

> Tan's son was then approached by an elderly man who apparently told him he was not supposed to cycle in that area.

> When his son returned to him, Tan told him to reason with the man should he encounter him in the future, and to ""stand up for [his] rights"".

> On Nov. 20, the son met the same man once again.

> In a video filmed by the boy during the encounter, the man can be heard taunting him to ""call police"".

> Meanwhile, the boy attempted to explain, as Tan said he taught him to, that cycling is allowed on park connectors according to the Land Transport Authority's regulations.

> However, the man asked the boy to ""go back"", ""turn back"" and that he ""don't want to see you here"".

> The boy asked: ""Who say I can't ride here?""

> The man said: ""I say. The government say.""

> While the boy tries to mention LTA again, the man interjects and says ""don't argue with me ah"", before a thud is heard and the boy's speech is cut off.

> The man proceeds to ask if the boy is ""tak[ing] picture"" and apparently swipes the boy's phone, causing it to drop and the video to go dark.

> Allegedly rained blows on the boy

> According to Tan, the man had apparently smacked his son in the face during the exchange, and subsequently continued to punch and kick him.

> A passer-by nearby went to help the boy, while Tan raced over to stop the man from leaving the scene.

> Tan then called the police. The man challenged him to fight as well, Tan added.

> Tan said:

> ""As I hand over my phone to my son. Telling him, come? He dare not move. I may not be very well educated, but at least I am civilise enough to reason things out. If my son is at fault, u beat him. I will definitely agree with u. But not this. When the witness tell the uncle, I see u punching him. You shouldn't do that. Then suddenly he turn soft and talk nicely to me and apologise to my son.""

> Photos he posted showed his son's injuries from the encounter, including a scrape on his chin.

> In response to Mothership's queries, the Police said that they were alerted to a case of voluntarily causing hurt along Hougang Ave 8 on Nov. 20 at around 6:45pm.

> A 12-year-old boy was conscious while conveyed to KK Women's and Children's Hospital.

> Police investigations are ongoing.

> Park Connector Network Rules

> According to the National Park Board (NParks), cycling is allowed along PCN.

> NParks advised cyclists to keep to the left side of the track, ride in single file and avoid weaving along the track.

> NParks also reminded cyclists to wear protective cycling gears such as helmet for their own safety.

Good

* Withdrawal from Nee Soon GRC (PAP 67% in 2015), Jalan Besar GRC (PAP 68%) and MacPherson SMC (PAP 66%), three areas that they are not likely to win this time round, allowing for focusing of resources on areas they actually can win (e.g. East Coast GRC)
* This withdrawal helps to accommodate the growing number of Opposition parties, slightly minimising any three-way fights
* Narrower slate of candidates places quality over quantity, which was rewarded by Aljunied voters in 2011 when WP sent its A-team there - shows that this strategy had some mild success in the past

Bad

* Such a move assumes that voters vote for quality candidates rather than the party - it may well be that voters are happy to vote for the WP brand as long as the candidates aren't spouting rubbish
* Contesting in only one SMC - SMCs give WP the best chance at picking up seats, so it appears to be a high-risk-high-return strategy compared to contesting more SMCs",t3_he4dmi,23-06-2020

I'm not so sure about this though. I think most PAP supporters vote for the PAP brand rather than individual candidates. It could well be because of the GRC system where they are unable to express their opinions about each individual candidate, but I don't think Jurong GRC will show a noticeable drop in PAP support just because of Tan Wu Meng. In 2015, PAP still garnered 49% with a generic, anchor minister-less slate of candidates in Aljunied. Of course, there are exceptions like Sitoh Yih Pin in Potong Pasir and Tin Pei Ling in MacPherson who are generally regarded as hardworking MPs, but overall I feel PAP supporters just vote for the PAP brand. 

For Opp supporters and swing voters, it's clear that quality matters to some extent. In three-cornered fights since 2013, candidates from SDA/RP/NSP lost their deposits when they went up against WP.

Condominiums and newer HDBs are built in the area, as well as in Ave7 (opposite Holy Innocent Sec Sch) and there is a huge influx of new voters into Hougang SMC. 

Many people (including numerous cab Drivers) have speculated that the renewal is part of the PAP tactic to dilute the strong WP base in Hougang. While it is far fetched, there may be some sense to it - you take away the hardcore supporter blocks which probably is 70% WP (in Ave3 market), introduce the general population which is probably 69% PAP (based on 2015 results), then you have a significant decrease in the WP base.

That said, I agree that aljunied is at a greater risk of being lost. Winning aljunied was already an uphill task. Holding it will be difficult too. Iirc, a couple of the aljunied mps wards didn't do so well in 2015.",t3_he4dmi,23-06-2020

1) Need a big and strong government to better manage the current and future pandemics.

2) Need a strong opposition core to watch the government, given how they have missed out on a major blindsight in this crisis (workers' dorms outbreak) despite warnings previously.

To me both are valid stands that look at the long-term, but personally I'm more inclined to the second one and hope more voters staying in wards with legit opposition candidates can consider that too.

Of course, there will be the other group of voters that look at short-term things like the $3000 handout from the government, which sadly forms the majority of the elderly voting group (my guess).",t3_he4dmi,23-06-2020

Knowing very well that older generation, new citizens, and gerrymandering meant that there’s almost no chance for opposition to win, there’s no harm voting opposition to lower their vote share to incentivise PAP. They are still going to get the supermajority and that mandate they want. I would rather not give them so much mandate that they can ignore us.

> One Foodpanda delivery rider recently received a rather perplexing order — at Hougang, even though he was at Bukit Panjang.

> Order pick up 20km away

> Speaking to Mothership, Dylan Chen explained that he rides a bicycle and is typically stationed in the west side of Singapore.

> He was however, ""unfortunate"" enough to be selected by Foodpanda to do a ""cycling marathon"".

> Chen received an order of fish soup that he had to deliver to a customer at Bukit Panjang Ring Rd.

> However the food was to be picked up at Hougang Ave 4, roughly 20km away from his location.

> The app stated that he would earn S$5 from the assignment.

> Chen then tried to contact Foodpanda's customer service.

> After apologising for the inconvenience caused, the customer service staff stated that Chen would have to carry out the order as he had already accepted it.

> This is despite the fact that Chen revealed he was riding a bicycle.

> The staff continued to insist that it was part of standard operating procedure.

> Chen said that following this exchange, the chat was closed.

> Left with no choice, he decided to re-dispatch the order on the chance that other riders nearer to Hougang would pick up the order.

> This he said, caused the customer to ""wait till no end"", and also impacted his record with Foodpanda.

> Chen said that riders who re-dispatch their orders can have their Batch level affected. Batches will determine riders' shift bookings, among other things.

> He also believes that she did not end up receiving her order.

> Thankfully though, he said that his Batch level was not affected after this incident.

> Mothership has reached out to Foodpanda for more information, and will update the story when they reply.

> Totally unrelated but follow and listen to our podcast here

When its raining, no choice but to do if you have a shift that day.

The app also glitches a lot. Just like in this post. Sometimes when offered a delivery, the app doesn't even show the riders the food pick up point and destination the rider decides whether to decline or accept the order. 

In addition, if you got book shift, sometimes they suka suka just remove your shift and give it to another rider.

I live near the infamous ""WP kopitiam"" along avenue 5, and its always fun to hear the drunken Singapore anthems and celebration when the results are announced (the year we won Aljunied for the first time was particularly wild, serious NDP vibes but with more boozed up uncles).

I'm sad to see Png Eng Huat retire, i thought he was starting to perform really well in parliament, especially when advancing values/moral-based arguments which always seem to throw the PAP off balance.

862,19,fwgkllr,t1_fwgiyhf,"Since the enactment of the Town Council Act in Singapore, the MPs run the Town Council.

This obviously creates a huge barrier to entry against the opposition in a Dominant-Party System, when a candidate that defeats the incumbent will need to take over the responsibilities of the Town Council in a short period of time, where the incumbent has very little obligation to co-operate. Predictably, this have led to a few cases where the dominant party has taken full advantage to damage the opposition.",t3_hii4af,30-06-2020
863,19,fwgxx8v,t1_fwgiyhf,"Singapore’s a city state so the “city council” is parliament lol. But each ward does have its own town council that handles the local issues in each area (the boundaries of which are redrawn every election...). So the job scope of an MP here would be much wider than simply speaking about issues in parliament. 

So a huge factor a lot of Singaporeans would put weight into while voting is whether their estate has been well managed by the incumbent MP, and other more pragmatic factors. Being a generally politically apathetic population, people don’t care what goes on in parliament. That lack of interest is also apparently why we don’t have any recordings or livestreams of parliamentary proceedings available publicly. So instead of looking at parliament performance to gauge if a candidate is favourable, you’d have to look elsewhere. 

How this dicks over the opposition is that the town council’s operations heavily favour being in the PAP’s hands, given that the entire system is built around that. You’re likely going to see a “AHTC case/trial” being brought up as a way to bring down confidence in the opposition’s competency to run their town council. Plus, in the past opposition wards would have less amenities compared to pap wards, like less lift upgradings/sheltered walkways etc. This was a tactic used to dissuade the population from voting for opposition - do you want your neighbourhood to become a “slum”? While this isn’t true anymore in the present day, the mindset is still pervasive. 

If you’re going to follow the elections, you’ve probably got to taper yourself a bit regarding the results. By democratic country standards it’s going to be a landslide victory for the incumbent party PAP. The interesting aspect is the margin by which the opposition loses.",t3_hii4af,30-06-2020

He knew my family well as my dad always approached him for his PR issues and he always did his best to help my dad by personally writing letters constantly to ICA and the government while keeping my dad posted. Few times a year he would bring my dad out for coffee at a nearby coffeeshop to just chat and listen to my dad’s concerns and whenever I met him in Meet-the-MP sessions he would always spend a few minutes talking to me and give me candy(I was a small boy back then). Due to his persistence even though the application will get rejected in the end there was at least information coming back to my family every now and then about the situation. When he lost in 2011 and promptly retired, my parents were obv heartbroken. During the night his PAP left our GRC for good he had a van bringing him and his other team members going around saying final goodbyes. My dad and I heard it and immediately rush out of the house and chased the van an entire street down before catching up as he stopped before the exit to the main road to bid farewell to a small crowd forming and cheering for him. Just before the van was about to go he saw and looked at my dad, nodded and said “Goodbye my dear friend” and the van left. Under WP however go to LTK though showed concern and looked like he really wanted to help and even also wrote a letter to ICA and govt but this time different. No letter no follow up and application was somehow rejected faster than before this time. so therefore ya even though technically still the same, it is tougher in being under opposition.

887,19,dxnyx1c,t3_8dkx0i,"> Few can boast of a 60-year career in any industry, but Facebook user ShuJun Koh found someone who can. Nestled away in Hougang is Uncle Tan, an ice cream seller with an unassuming demeanour. But behind the checkered shirt and weathered skin is a man who takes deep pride in his craft. Netizens were alerted to his story by a post Ms Koh put up on Saturday (14 Apr). In it, Ms Koh described a conversation she had with Uncle Tan.

>It began with her asking Uncle Tan if his ice cream was of the same variety sold by vendors along Orchard Road. To this, Uncle Tan replied, I make my own ice cream. I have been making these ice creams for the past 60 years. His pride is clear. He explains that his durian-flavoured variety is made of authentic Mao Shan Wang durians. The attap-chee flavour, he’ll have you know, is made with “big attap seeds, not small pieces”.

>Besides durian and attap-chee, Uncle Tan also whips up three other flavours: chocolate, mango and coconut. When asked why he doesn’t want to set up shop in a more populated locale like Jurong, Uncle Tan comes back with a funny retort:Jurong? Cannot lah. This vehicle cannot get onto expressway.

> The post has been shared by more than 4,000 users, who were likely hit by a wave of nostalgia for an authentic taste of the past. The interest in Uncle Tan’s traditional fare comes against the backdrop of ageing ice cream vendors with few willing to take over their reins when they retire. Once a common sight in Singapore, these carts are now often acknowledged as part of our disappearing heritage.

> Here again, Uncle Tan stands out among his peers: his business helps to strengthen inter-generational ties within his family. According to Shin Min Daily News, both his daughter-in-law and his 14-year-old grandson help out with his business. His grandson even hopes to open his own ice cream factory one day. Asked why he does not sell his ice cream at busy intersections such an interchange or outside a school, Uncle Tan is candid in his response. Interchanges, he says, are too busy. And schools? Some kids with no money but keep standing beside you and look[ing]at the ice cream, how to tahan?

> How to tahan the temptation of his ice cream? Of course cannot la. Truly, both Uncle Tan and his thriving craft are essential ingredients to our local flavour.

2. They're mosquitoes - they don't know any better. Horny must f\*\*k, that's really all there is to it.
3. They can still mate. They just won't be able to have viable offspring. That means everything APPEARS normal until the babies just... don't work right. Either the males die in the eggs, or come out 'feminized' with no working genitals, or any other number of horrible fates.
4. It, apparently, helps insects develop resistances to the common infections they often carry, making transmission less likely. Am not biologist, do not understand why or how.

The bacteria is harmless to humans and most non-insect, non-arthropod species, because we're not its target species.

1024,19,g6oaiyc,t1_g6nmp19,"Regarding your ""mens' rights kids"" remark, please pardon me but I have to respectfully say that it is rather condescending to dismiss the diversity and intricacies of boys and men's issues solely upon the phenomenon of voyeurism, notwithstanding the fact that most cases of such acts, or any acts of sexual deviance go unnoticed or unreported and males generally have a much harder time reporting their victimisation or even recognise themselves as victims. I should know, since I am one of many. 

In the scope of sexual deviancy, I do not believe any reasonable person, regardless of their gender are going to downplay the significance of female victimisation for it will be utterly vile. For myself at least, it is never about diminishing the detriments faced by female victims or absolving the atrocious conducts of male perpetrators. It is about viewing male victimisation and female perpetration in equal regards relative to their counterparts, both legislatively and socially. 

Female and male issues are by and large not mutually exclusive. There are much more overlaps than non-congruences. There are rooms for improvement for all individuals of both sexes and thus it will be appropriate to tackle issues from multiple perspectives. I am heartened by the recent announcement by the government to address women's issues. I also earnestly hope that a similar effort to address males' issues is somewhere on the horizon.

But these were actions of the person alone, he didn't commit these crimes simply because he was a man. He committed these crimes because he wanted to.
If he was actually taking obscene photos of another man in a bathroom stall and also likewise punched the victim when confronted, then what will be your approach? ""Oh in this case mens rights can activate cos it is same gender hur dur.""  

Likewise a much more screwed up thing to say would be: if the same crime was committed by a mentally-challenged person that society has failed him, are you gonna blanket all mentally-challenged people as a threat towards a single gender?  

What if this male criminal wasn't even a supporter of men's rights, in fact a supporter of women's rights. Then throw the crime out the window?

> SINGAPORE: A man who molested six girls at Hougang Swimming Complex was sentenced to 20 weeks' jail on Wednesday (Jul 3).

> Indian national Job Mathew Panakkal, 37, was at the pool on the evening of Sep 12 last year when he touched the girls. They were aged between 10 and 13.

> Advertisement

> According to a police report filed by a social worker, Job pursued the girls by swimming faster than them even when they tried to swim away from him.

> Job, who was working in Singapore as an infrastructure engineer, pleaded guilty to three charges of outraging the modesty of a minor, with another four charges taken into consideration. He molested one of the victims twice.

> The court heard that Job entered the adult pool at about 7pm and began swimming laps in the first lane. A group of boys and girls entered the pool after him, and some girls began swimming in his lane.

> ""When he swam in the direction of the girls in lane 1, the accused felt the urge to touch them and formed the intention to outrage their modesty,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Victoria Ting.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> One of the victims, who was 13, was in the pool when she noticed Job swimming quickly on her right. As he swam past her, he stretched out his hand and touched her right thigh.

> After she felt this, the girl swam faster, but Job continued following her until she swam between other swimmers who were in a group.

> The youngest victim, who was 10, felt two fingers on her left thigh and turned to see Job. Feeling ""disgusted and outraged"", she went to the end of the pool and told her swimming instructor about what had happened, court documents said.

> A 12-year-old victim was molested on her buttocks as Job swam past her, tapping her with his hand.

> She similarly told her swimming coach about the matter.

> For outraging the modesty of the minors, Job could have been jailed for up to five years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these penalties.

> SINGAPORE: Residents and former residents of a single block in Hougang will be offered free and voluntary tuberculosis (TB) screening by the Ministry of Health (MOH) as a precautionary measure after four people from the block were found to have contracted the disease.

> ""MOH was notified on 10 October 2020 of four TB cases involving residents of the same HDB block at 174D Hougang Avenue 1, who were diagnosed between January 2018 (and) June 2020,"" said the ministry in a news release on Saturday (Oct 24).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""All four individuals live in different units of Block 174D. The cases had immediately started treatment following diagnosis. Among them, two have completed treatment, while the remaining two are currently undergoing treatment and are no longer infectious.

> ""As individuals diagnosed with TB will rapidly become non-infectious once treatment starts, the cases are not an ongoing public health risk,"" MOH added.

> The screening will be conducted at the Tuberculosis Control Unit (TBCU) located at Moulmein Road from Oct 26.

> Between Sunday and Tuesday, officers from the unit and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) will be conducting house visits to all units at Block 174D Hougang Avenue 1 to ""engage affected residents and encourage them to go for the screening"".

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Residents will be able to make appointments for the screening at TBCU during the house visits or call the unit to make an appointment. Former residents who had lived in the block from February 2020 and want to be screened can call the TBCU hotline.

> MOH said the Singapore TB Elimination Programme (STEP) had initiated contact investigations upon notification of the four cases. Close contacts of the cases were identified and contacted by STEP for screening.

> ""Investigations for each of the four cases at the time of their diagnosis did not identify each other as close contacts,"" said the ministry.

> 

> It added that the expanded tuberculosis screening beyond close contacts of the cases was a “precautionary measure to assure and protect residents living in the same block”.

> Advertisement

> “The exercise could help detect any undiagnosed TB cases,” MOH said.

> 

> Those with positive screening results will be offered appropriate advice and follow-up. Those with active TB will be ""treated immediately"" while those with latent non-infectious TB will be monitored and treated if necessary, said the ministry.

> HOW THE HOUGANG CLUSTER WAS DETERMINED

> MOH said the cluster at the Hougang block was ""determined due to the results of the genetic sequencing performed in October 2020 as part of retrospective testing of TB cases to determine possible linkages"".

> 

> “This revealed that all four cases have similar genetic make-up.

> “Investigations into the cases did not reveal any common links, other than that they live in the same block. They did not know or interact with one another, or congregate at the same common areas, and had also not identified each other as close contacts.

> “The TB cluster therefore does not fit the usual pattern of TB spread,"" the ministry said.

> TB is typically spread through close and prolonged contact with an infectious individual and not by contact with items or surfaces touched by a person with tuberculosis.

> According to MOH, tuberculosis is an endemic in Singapore and latent tuberculosis infection is not uncommon in the population because the disease had been prevalent in the country until the 1970s. Older Singaporeans could have been exposed to it and acquired latent tuberculosis infection when they were younger.

> Those with latent tuberculosis do not experience symptoms of tuberculosis and are not infectious, it added.

> ""TB is curable and the spread of TB is preventable. Early detection and prompt treatment of cases remain important in helping those infected and rendering them non-infectious. For individuals diagnosed with active TB, adherence to treatment is important,"" said MOH.

> SINGAPORE - A 25-year-old Bangladeshi construction worker died after a steel plate fell on him in an accident at a condominium worksite on Tuesday (Sept 17).

> The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has issued an order to stop the use and movement of all heavy machinery at the Hougang worksite where the accident happened.

> The ministry is also investigating the accident, MOM told The Straits Times.

> In its statement, an MOM spokesman said that the developer of the site is Florence Developer, while the occupier is Tiong Aik Construction. Dsoon Engineering is the dead worker's employer.

> The accident took place at The Florence Residences worksite in Hougang Avenue 2, where nine 18-storey condominium blocks are scheduled to be completed in March 2022, according to Tiong Aik's website.

> In a video of the accident circulating online, workers can be seen using an excavator to lift the steel plate in an attempt to rescue the trapped man.

> Dsoon Engineering declined to comment on the accident when contacted by ST on Thursday.

> ST has contacted Tiong Aik Construction for comment.

> Seventeen workers died from workplace accidents in the first half of this year, compared to 18 workers in the same period last year.

> A total of 41 cases of workers dying from workplace accidents were recorded in 2018.

> Singapore's workplace fatal injury rate has gone down over the years, from 4.9 per 100,000 workers in 2004 to 1.2 per 100,000 in the past two years.

> The Tripartite Strategies Committee's 2028 goal is to reduce Singapore's workplace fatal injury rate to less than 1.0 per 100,000 by that time

> SINGAPORE: A cleaner was fined S$3,500 on Wednesday (May 13) for cursing at a safe distancing enforcement officer who was deployed at Hougang Mall.

> The incident happened after the officer told the cleaner's wife, who was loitering outside the mall, to go home. She was outside Hougang Mall selling headscarves and waiting for a customer when she was told to leave.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Her husband Abdul Halim Adi, 48, pleaded guilty to one charge of using abusive words on a safe distancing enforcement officer.

> The incident occurred at about 1pm on Apr 14 this year, during the ""circuit breaker"" period when most businesses were ordered to close and people were urged to stay home to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

> The victim, a 32-year-old HDB officer deployed as a safe distancing enforcement officer, was carrying out his work when he saw Abdul Halim's wife outside Hougang Mall.

> She was waiting to hand a headscarf to a customer, and was carrying on a business outside her home when she was not an essential service provider, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Gail Wong.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The officer walked towards the woman, but she left when she spotted him.

> The officer entered the mall and spotted the woman about 15 minutes later. He told her to go home, and she said she would do so.

> However, the woman instead went to look for her husband, who was at the basement level of the mall near a supermarket.

> She told Abdul Halim that the safe distancing officer had been following her and had told her to go home.

> At this point, the officer walked past the couple. Abdul Halim saw the officer and his pass, knowing that he was enforcing safe distancing measures.

> Displeased by the victim's directions to his wife, Abdul Halim hurled Hokkien vulgarities at him and said ""why did you harass my wife"".

> The victim did not engage the pair, instead walking away and calling the police immediately.

> There were about 10 to 15 passers-by at the time, with some stopping to watch.

> The prosecutor asked for a fine of at least S$3,500, noting that enforcement officers tasked with performing ""difficult jobs of patrolling and safeguarding public health in the COVID-19 circuit breaker period"" must be protected.

> ""That being said, while general deterrence is the operative sentencing principle, here, the outburst was short and impulsive, and the crowd was thin, even if it was unwarranted,"" said Ms Wong.

> She added that Abdul Halim did not have previous related convictions, and that there was no evidence of him continuing to be aggressive.

> The judge allowed Abdul Halim to pay his fine in instalments by mid-November.

> For using abusive words on a safe distancing officer carrying out his duty, he could have been jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$5,000, or both.

He didn’t execute any  form of violence or intent to cause hurt right? So why involve police  action? Why financially punish them? Could it not have been solved with  dialogue first? Did they even try? Why call the police STRAIGHT AWAY? Is  this how we treat the people in the lower end of our economy?

The husband responded with vulgarities and the EO chose to call the cops instead of arguing with him. I do not see anything wrong with that.

> SINGAPORE - A fire related to a personal mobility device (PMD) broke out outside an 11th floor Housing Board flat in Hougang on Monday evening (Nov 4).

> The fire broke out at about 5pm at Block 927, Hougang Street 91, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a statement on their Facebook page.

> The fire involved a PMD along the corridor and was extinguished by SCDF with buckets of water.

> Two residents of the flat in a state of shock were assessed by an SCDF paramedic but they later refused to be taken to the hospital.

> SCDF said preliminary investigations showed that the source of the fire was electrical in origin from a PMD that did not meet a set of safety requirements, called the UL2272 standard. The PMD was charging at the time of the fire.

> The UL2272 standard includes safety requirements covering the electrical drive train system of PMDs, such as the battery system.

> In the first half of this year, there were 49 fires related to PMDs, an average of about two a week.

> In the worst of these cases, home owner Goh Keng Soon, 40, died in hospital on July 20, two days after he was rescued unconscious from a burning flat in Bukit Batok. The blaze was linked to three e-scooters found burnt in the unit.

> The Land Transport Authority (LTA) encourages all PMD owners to use UL2272 certified devices and to look out the UL2272 certification marks when purchasing a PMD.

> Related Story LTA reviews PMD safety certification deadline after fires: Types of fires in homes and ways to fight them

> Owners of non-UL2272-certified PMDs are encouraged to dispose of their devices at designated points as soon as possible.

> LTA is facilitating this process at 213 spots across the island at no cost to e-scooter owners. This will last six months from Sept 23 this year to March 31 next year, with those who do so before the end of the year eligible for a $100 incentive.

> E-scooter owners can refer to LTA's website for more information on the UL2272 standard and the free disposal scheme.

Here is a good read on how fast they can reproduce

&#x200B;

>Pigeons live in large flocks of 20+. They breed as monogamous pairs that will raise up to six broods of 2 eggs a year.  That comes out to 12 new pigeons per pair per year.  Six months later those new pigeons can begin breeding. The math gets a bit tricky here, as only about half of those could be breeding by mid-year. Assuming 8 of them can have 2-3 broods before the end of that year of 2 eggs each, we are looking at 30+ new pigeons, plus the original 15 babies, and I think that’s conservative. So, in one year, we’ve gone from 2 pigeons to 45+ pigeons. That’s a population increase of 21.5% annually. Following this math there will be 1,000+ by the second year.

> A Facebook video by Acres (Animal Concerns Research and Education Society Singapore) posted on April 9, 2019, provided a first hand look at the reality of how pigeons are culled in Singapore.

> Advertisement

> Here’s the video:

> *WARNING: The video below may be distressing to some*

> Advertisement

> Stuffing pigeons into trash bags

> The video shows numerous pigeons sitting motionless on the ground, supposedly after having been poisoned.

> Workers, reportedly engaged by the town council, approached with a large black trash bag in hand, and put the live pigeons in the bag.

> The pigeons put up little fight, although some tried to lethargically fly away — whatever poison they were allegedly fed seemed to have taken effect.

> Another clip in the video shows a worker kicking a pigeon into the dustpan he was holding, and then shovelling the pigeon into the trash bag.

> One pigeon also seemed to have its wing injured, with the appendage hanging limp, and the bird struggling on the floor.

> Viewers can even see the pigeons writhing around inside the black trash bags.

> It is unsure how exactly the pigeons were poisoned. However in previous culling exercises, pigeons were ‘baited’ with poisoned food thrown on the ground.

> Mothership has reached out to Nparks and will update the article with their comments on the matter when we receive them.

> Advertisement

> Facebook users shocked and angry

> Many of the comments flooding the post have been of shock and anger at the treatment of the birds.

> One woman chimed in with her own experience where she witnessed the actual culling taking place in Hougang, saying she saw pigeons dropping from the skies and getting run over by cars.

> This isn’t the first time residents have been up in arms about the inhumane nature of bird culling.

> A recent culling exercise for mynahs where a tree with the roosting birds was enclosed and then pumped with carbon dioxide, was carried out in December 2018.

> It caused an uproar among netizens questioning the morality of such an exercise.

> Advertisement

> Don’t feed the pigeons

> Pigeon culling is usually carried out in response to feedback or complaints by residents—many often find their droppings unsightly, and the pigeons a nuisance, reported CNA.

> Although culling may seem to be a simple be-all and end-all solution to decreasing pigeon populations, a less inhumane route would be to simply avoid feeding pigeons.

> This was something Acres also highly discouraged in their Facebook post.

> Advertisement

> According to CNA, contrary to the good that feeders may think they are doing, feeding pigeons would only result in large congregations of the birds in one area.

> Feeding also encourages the birds to breed, and is thus one of the main contributors to their population growth.

> Anyone caught feeding pigeons can be fined up to S$500 under the Wild Animals and Birds Act.

> 

> Food waste improperly disposed of could potentially be another source of food for pigeons too.

> Acres filing cruelty case

> Acres also stated in their Facebook post that they would be filing a cruelty case, possibly against the town council, to investigate the way the birds were handled.

> The group also urged viewers to write to their respective town councils and voice out against such culling measures.

> But perhaps if a culture of consideration and conscientiousness is cultivated, where residents do not needlessly throw food out to the birds, or leave their food waste lying around, we might see less saddening sights like of that in Hougang.

> Advertisement

> Birth control for pigeons

> A more humane alternative to pigeon culling was also conceived in Vancouver, Canada.

> A pilot project carried out to control their pigeon population involves an automatic bird feeder which dispenses bird pellets containing contraceptives called OvoControl, according to Global News.

> .@TransLink is putting pigeons on the pill. This feeder, newly installed behind VCC-Clark Station, will dispense birth control to the pigeons. They say it's ""non-toxic, effective and humane."" @GlobalBC pic.twitter.com/ZoIJkQW9hZ — Jordan Armstrong (@jarmstrongbc) February 7, 2019

> The birth control is reportedly non-toxic, and studies have shown that pigeon populations managed by OvoControl have decreased by 50 to 90 per cent.

> The method has been lauded by wildlife and animal groups.

> Maybe this could be a viable alternative that could be applied here.

From a Humane Society of the US article, [""What to do about pigeons""](https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/what-do-about-pigeons).

There is no evidence of disease risk:

Killing doesn't work:

> Killing, by any means, isn’t just cruel; it fails to solve the root cause of the problem, leading to an endless cycle of killing. ...

The shit response Pritam got from MND in Apr 2020 when he asked for the breakdown (I think he has pressed them for this almost every year):

&#x200B;

>Written Answer by Ministry of National Development on funding support for Community Improvement Projects Committee  
>  
>Apr 6, 2020  
>  
>Mr Pritam Singh: To ask the Minister for National Development how much Community Improvement Projects Committee funding was applied for and allocated to each grassroots adviser and/or Citizens' Consultative Committee from FY2016 to date.  
>  
>Answer:  
>  
>The Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) provides funding support for improvement projects in HDB estates for the benefit of local residents. Such facilities include covered walkways, footpaths, playgrounds and bicycle racks.  
>  
>The CIPC sets aside budget for the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) each year based on the number of HDB residential units in each constituency. The CCCs can decide how to utilise these funds for their projects, and have to raise their own funds to co-pay 10% of the project costs.    
>  
>As the Town Councils have to maintain the completed CIPC projects that are built on HDB common property, the CCCs also have to seek the Town Councils’ agreement to maintain the infrastructure before construction work can commence.  
>  
>**It is not meaningful to compare CIPC funding across CCCs as every constituency is different and their residents have different needs.** This is why the CIPC generally lets the CCCs, who are closer to the ground, decide on the selection of the projects to best meet the needs of the residents.

> This S'pore property agent is setting the standard for property home tour videos, creativity-wise.

> Singing a parody of popular Mandopop song ""今天你要嫁给我"", the agent, Rechard Tan, highlights the very best parts of the property with original lyrics that get you all warm in the feels.

> The parody is titled "" 8481我等你"", which roughly translates to ""8481, I'll await your call"".

> Hougang HDB

> The song starts off by listing basic information about the flat:

> Hougang 4-room HDB She recently just achieved MOP She sits at Blk 477C

> before moving into the unique selling points of the apartment. The usual property buzz words are weaved into the lyrics and paired with well-chosen shots of the unit.

> Unblocked river scenery 990 square feet, design is Japanese Reno is good quality

> The rap segment in the song, which features nearby amenities, in particular Punggol Park which is just a jog away, was a hit with netizens.

> A collaborative effort

> Speaking to Mothership, property agent Tan said that the video was a collaborative effort. He expressed special thanks to the OrangeTee AAG division for supporting him in exploring his ""personal interest"".

> The entire video process took a few weeks to be completed, with Tan writing the lyrics and then collaborating with the property agency's video team for filming.

> The theme was chosen to ""appeal to newlyweds"" — the song choice is pretty much self-explanatory.

> Tan also explained that special care had been taken to ensure that the lyrics, subtitled in both Chinese and English, flowed with the melody of the song.

> Put on the market prior to the video's success, the property has already been sold for $560,000.

> Goldhill Family Restaurant is quite a well-known name around the Hougang area.

> It is primarily known for its incredibly cheap mixed vegetable rice, also known as cai png: At only S$2 for rice with two vegetables, and one meat.

> Food sites have constantly praised the restaurant’s cheap but tasty spread.

> Which has unsurprisingly resulted in a steady stream of hungry clientele.

> Location

> The location of the restaurant in Hougang, which is near the Defu industrial estate, provides some insight into its popularity as well as its low prices.

> In an interview with Shin Min Daily, the owner, 56-year-old, Guo Fu Cai, delved deeper into how his stall operates.

> They cook about 25 dishes every day, with meat dishes going at S$1 per serving, and the vegetables at S$0.50.

> Advertisement

> Although Guo acknowledges that the low price means profit margins aren’t that great, the fact that there are so many customers, mainly workers from nearby industrial areas, kind of makes up for it.

> Awesome.

> SINGAPORE: A new heritage trail has been launched in Hougang, charting its transformation from a rural area to a modern heartland estate.

> It will be the National Heritage Board’s (NHB) 20th heritage trail and part of ongoing efforts to “document and promote district histories and social memories of different areas where Singaporeans live, work and play”, NHB said in a media release on Thursday (Oct 29).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The Hougang heritage trail will also be the first to feature two national monuments – the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Hougang Tou Mu Kung.

> The Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary. (Photo: National Heritage Board)

> “Through our new Hougang Heritage Trail and our other trails, we hope to encourage Singaporeans to explore their own backyards during this period of travel restrictions, and rediscover local heritage delights,” said NHB’s Deputy Chief Executive (Policy & Community) Alvin Tan.

> “In doing so, we hope that Singaporeans will come away with a renewed appreciation of what Singapore has to offer in terms of unique heritage experiences with a strong local appeal.”

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Here are some things you may not know about Hougang:

> Why is it pronounced “Au Kang”?

> The first documented use of “Au Kang”, which means “back of the river” in both Teochew and Hokkien, was in 1856. “Hougang” is the Mandarin version, which was introduced in 1980 for the new residential town that was being built at the time.

> Advertisement

> The name is a reference to Sungei Serangoon at the end of Upper Serangoon Road, where many Teochew-speaking inhabitants settled.

> “While the old Teochew pronunciation has endured and the Teochew community continues to have a strong presence, much has changed,” NHB said.

> “A strong, diverse mix of other communities and cultures has also developed and continues to accentuate the colourful character of one of Singapore’s oldest towns.”

> It features several places of faith for different religions

> Many of the places of faith in Hougang originate from the early kampung days.

> View of Zi Yun Kai Ji Gong. (Photo: National Heritage Board)

> The arrival of Catholic Teochew immigrants from China in the 1800s led to the establishment of religious institutions in the area, NHB said.

> This includes the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Mary, the oldest place of worship in the area and a national monument featured on the heritage tour. It continues to provide religious services in Teochew today.

> Hougang Tou Mu Kung, the oldest temple in Singapore dedicated to the Nine Emperor Gods, is also featured on the trail. It began as a shrine in Lim Loh village in 1902 and remains well known for its grand celebrations during the annual Nine Emperor Gods festival, NHB said.

> The St Paul’s Church is seen at its current site in 2018. (Photo: National Heritage Board)

> View of Masjid Haji Yusoff. (Photo: National Heritage Board)

> Also featured are St Paul’s Church, Masjid Haji Yusoff, and Taoist and Buddhist temples, which were established to serve devotees from different clans and dialect groups.

> Hougang is home to several community institutions

> Hougang is also home to several institutions that were established to serve the community. They helped provide medical care, education and social support, as well as advancing community bonding.

> Among these institutions is the Ramakrishna Mission, which bought the land at Bartley Road in 1941 and built a boys’ home for those affected by the war, as well as a temple in 1954 for devotees of Sri Ramakrishna.

> 

> Another institution, Phoh Kiu Siang T’ng, started in 1929 at Upper Circular Road - itself a Teochew enclave then - and moved to Simon Lane in 1953.

> It started by providing funeral services to members and dispensing medicine to the poor, NHB said, adding that it operates a free clinic today.

> Also in the area is the Serangoon Khiung Jai Co-Villagers Association, which represented and served the Hainanese living in Lorong Ah Soo.

> It continues to be active in fostering ties among the Hainanese in Singapore.

> Look out for unique architectural features

> Hougang is home to a number of buildings and Housing Development Board (HDB) blocks with unique architectural features such as curved columns and stepped pitched-roof buildings.

> The first town centre at Hougang Street 21 was designed with elements of colonial architecture referencing Singapore’s pre-war bungalows, which include low-rise buildings with rounded arches, multi-paned windows and louvres.

> 

> The second town centre, located at Hougang Central, can be distinguished by a pair of blocks with stepped pitch-roof buildings, a callback to Hougang’s rural past.

> In the 1980s, HDB started to create a distinctive identity for different housing estates.

> In Hougang, they introduced curvatures to its buildings with rounded balconies and curved columns. Some blocks were decorated with murals, including the iconic Block 316, which has a rainbow mural, and Block 25, which features a sky mural.

> Block 25 along Upper Serangoon Road with a mural of the sky painted on its facade. (Photo: National Heritage Board)

> While Block 316 has been repainted a number of times and each reiteration resulted in a new design, it has always been adorned with a rainbow mural.

> Block 316 with its iconic rainbow mural painted on its facade at Hougang Avenue 7. (Photo: National Heritage Board)

> Crocodile farms and Singapore's first fast-food outlet in a housing estate

> Hougang was the first estate in Singapore to have a fast-food outlet when McDonald's opened one in its town centre in 1984. It remains in its original location today.

> 

> The estate was also formerly home to a number of crocodile farms.

> This includes the Singapore Crocodile Farm, which was established in 1945 and had about 600 crocodiles by the 1980s. Other smaller farms were also in the area.

> 

> Hougang Plaza, which opened in 1993, was touted as the first ""all entertainment complex in an HDB estate"". It provided recreational facilities such as a bowling alley, billiards hall and a cineplex to residents until it was demolished in 2013.

> ​​​​​​​Editor’s note: This article has been updated to reflect a correction by NHB on the arrival of Catholic Teochew immigrants in Singapore in the 1800s.

> SINGAPORE - Hougang's dead-eye over the deadball Zulfahmi Arifin proved the difference as the Cheetahs romped to a 4-1 win over Geylang International at the Jalan Besar Stadium on Saturday (April 20) to climb up to second in the nine-team Singapore Premier League (SPL).

> The Hougang skipper provided assists for Jordan Vestering (7th minute) and Afiq Yunos (67th), from a corner kick and free kick respectively, with Amir Zalani (55th) and Fazrul Nawaz (83rd) scoring the home side's other goals.

> A header by Geylang's Dutch midfielder Barry Maguire in the 49th minute had given the Eagles hope for a fightback but proved mere consolation.

> Geylang coach Noor Ali said the difference in quality between the two sides - half of Hougang's 18-man matchday squad have earned Singapore caps, compared to only four from Geylang's - was telling.

> ""We had our chances, but at the end of the day quality is what counts,"" said the 43-year-old coach.

> ""They don't pay Zulfahmi (well) for no reason, and his delivery of the ball was something we found very hard to contain.""

> Zulfahmi, 27, recently scored his first international goal for Singapore, curling home a fine free kick from 25 metres in the 1-1 draw with Oman on March 23.

> Aside from his pin-point deliveries at Jalan Besar on Saturday, Zulfahmi also provided a calming influence to the Hougang backline, playing in the centre of a five-man defence, before moving into a midfield role in the second half.

> 

> Hougang coach Clement Teo, however, felt his skipper did not play to his best.

> ""I've known Zul since he was 16 and this boy has got tremendous talent,"" said the coach.

> ""But, as far as I am concerned, there were phases of the game where he should have done better.""

> Despite seeing his team leapfrog Tampines Rovers into second place in the league for at least 24 hours - the Stags play Balestier Khalsa on Sunday - Teo believes his charges still have much room for improvement.

> He said: ""Credit to the players, they have shown they are able to play, and fight for each other as a team.

> ""But it's only the sixth game, and the team have got a lot of potential, but we need to take it one game at a time. We can't think that now we're already (second), we're doing good enough.""

Images to show the public-spiritedness displayed by the volunteer bicycle-clearing group led by the Bulgarian Zhivko Girginov was put up on Facebook on July 6

Might take months

This volunteer group stepped in to fill the gap after oBike and its hired contractor failed to clear the bikes in time by July 4 — the deadline set by the authorities.
The Land Transport Authority will claim the retrieval costs and bikes’ storage fees from oBike as a result.

It was recently revealed by oBike that there are some 70,000 bicycles on the streets.
It is estimated to take several months or even a year to remove the bicycles.

Get your refunds too

Besides showcasing the hard work put in by the volunteers, the highly-informative Facebook post also provided details for those in Singapore who want to get their deposits refunded.
oBike’s appointed liquidator is FTI Consulting.
It is an United States-headquartered company.

Joshua James Taylor and Yit Chee Wah from FTI Consulting have advised those in Singapore who have yet to receive their oBike deposit refunds to send their queries to oBike@fticonsulting.com.
Further updates will be provided to deposit holders in due course, the liquidator company added.
