4,6,eg5gvmt,t1_eg5fmku,My guess is that they have to divide the available manpower at the hospitals. 1 seriously injured person alone probably involves more than 10 hospital staff.,t3_ap2bny,10-02-2019
5,6,eg605mc,t1_eg5fmku,Different hospitals have different specialties. Maybe the patients required different kind of medical procedure. Also could be the temporary lack of resources to deal with more than 2 patients. ,t3_ap2bny,10-02-2019
6,6,eg63k4y,t1_eg5fmku,"Used to be that head injury cases from road traffic accidents were taken to TTSH, don't know if it's still the case now. The reason was it had the first ct scan in a public hospital.",t3_ap2bny,10-02-2019
