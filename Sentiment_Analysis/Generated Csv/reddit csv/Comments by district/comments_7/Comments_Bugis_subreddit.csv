107,6,fh7z0b8,t1_fh7ig7y,"# Every day for the last few weeks, I walk by this advertisement in the transit area of Bugis MRT, and it's driving me crazy. It's a floor-to-ceiling Chinese New Year-themed commercial showing off ""Classic"" and ""No Sugar"" Coca-Cola. Now, I'd like to think of myself as somewhat of an independent, critical thinker, a true zoomerlennial who wasn't influenced by these kinds of simple visual corporate marketing tactics.

# But I was wrong. You see, this ad was different. It was playing music.

# It was a cheap and soulless melody, a generic jingle in a simple A-B-A musical composition, blasting from an economy-class pair of speakers. The first time I encountered it, I brushed it off as merely a mild distraction. And yet, as a week passed, I found myself beginning to exhibit... unusual behaviours.

# I would unconsciously hum that annoying tune to myself, as I worked. I became hypersensitive to any sound of a canned drink opening, and spent work hours researching on whether Coca-Cola No Sugar was truly the Healthier Choice as they claimed. I caught myself taking long, wistful stares at an entire shelf of beautifully manufactured, glossy coke bottles at NTUC. The pounding within my heart reminded me of my JC days; it was the same feeling I had whenever my crush turned around, glanced and smiled at my right ear with her eyes slightly out of focus.

# Chinese New Year arrived, during which the devil tempted my SAF-endorsed resilience and discipline with an endless supply of Coke (courtesy of my relatives). I could not bear the suffering any more. My pre-enlightenment self would've been embarrassed and ashamed to be defeated, but as I twisted the tab open and flushed the acidic liquid down my throat I felt only victory. It was euphoric; it was as if I was ready to love again.

# My daily routine has since evolved. Seeing that now-familiar ad on the way to the East-West Line platform would fill me with hope for the day ahead, and a desire to quench my thirst for some freshly carbonated Coca-Cola‚Ñ¢. Instead of my outdated habit of 0% sugar diet bubble tea, I would hydrate myself over lunch with what I now believe to be a superior health beverage ‚Äî ùïÆùñîùñàùñÜ-ùïÆùñîùñëùñÜ No Sugar‚Ñ¢. And at the end of a day of toil, as I made my commute in the opposite direction, I am reminded again that I am returning to a warm, cosy home, where I can crack open an ice-cold, refreshing can of ‚ÑÇùï†ùïîùïí-‚ÑÇùï†ùïùùïí ‚ÑÇùïùùïíùï§ùï§ùïöùïî¬Æ to take my mind off the troubles of the day.

# I would like to thank the fantastic team at The Coca-Cola Company's marketing department for bringing me together with what I believe is the love of my life. Without that obnoxious ad with its percussive harmonies wearing down at my hardened, cynical mental barrier, I might never have known the joy I now possess. I would never have imagined that Coca-Cola would bring me happiness and (spiritual) prosperity, just like what that ad promised. I truly feel as if I have been born again, as if I had previously only been a physical shell who have now achieved an inner mental renaissance. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

# Edit: There's an RSAF recruitment ad along the travelators now that's getting me real excited, anybody wants to sign on with me?",t3_f1ovg4,10-02-2020

He is part of a larger system of economics that will bring in an huge inflow of masks because of the high profits that can be made. This is called adam smiths ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù.  It basically says that each person should do what makes them better off and the market will work out for everyone. According to economists, this is actually MORE ethical because it will help the most people in the long run.  If he tried lowering his prices or giving away masks for free, rich people would just get more. Instead of buying 10 masks for $50 the rich would buy 100 masks for $50. Lowering the price won‚Äôt cause the dispersion of masks to change much. It also ignores the fact that every other business selling these masks would have to lower their prices as well. Or else this guy would sell just sell out instantly and the other competitors would raise their prices since there is more demand and less supply.

Of course this is an aspect of a free market. So if the country that this is happening in doesn‚Äôt have a free market, then the government can be blamed. If it does, then the government has already done some good by enacting the policies that allow this free market activity to take place. Though the government may need to step in with a subsidy if this was going to be a long term problem. The inflow of new masks should happen pretty quickly though and so there really isn‚Äôt much they can do.

The best thing would be for this guy to keep selling at market prices so more supply will come in.

If more people donated masks (priced high or not) to needy people, the better everyone‚Äôs health would be. 

You are pointing out that market has no solution to this. Priced high or low, it doesn‚Äôt help the people who need it most. He should have a sign that says free to anyone over 60 or have kids.

I mean do you really want to be in a situation where old and young are dying and infecting everyone else just because we wanted to sit back and hope ‚Äúmarket forces‚Äù would provide this invisible hand to help? 

No invisible hand helps an old vulnerable person who can‚Äôt afford $30 boxes of masks every week. And a shortage of masks doesn‚Äôt help either. So clearly we need government or charity of kind people to step in.

This seller is not helping anyone. just rich people that are paranoid and his own pocketbook.

Perhaps the shift gathered momentum after Billy Graham's 1978 National Stadium ""crusade"" in Singapore ...  

**[Christians in Singapore Pay Tribute to Billy Graham](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/christians-in-spore-pay-tribute-to-billy-graham) (ST - 23 Feb 2018)**  

> Christians in Singapore remembered American evangelist Billy Graham as a ""spiritual giant"" who left a lasting impact on the faith after his crusade here in 1978.  
> [...]  
> Social anthropologist Lai Ah Eng, 63, said: ""A lot of people I knew in my generation were exposed to these religious ideas and converted to Christianity. Many of them were teenagers and young adults. The bulk of Christian conversions in Singapore happened in the 1970s to the 1990s.""

&nbsp;

And related food for thought ...

> [...]  
> When Private Parts was first commissioned by TheatreWorks for the 1992 Singapore Festival of Arts, Singapore had just redeveloped the famous transsexual haunt of Bugis Street into a squeaky clean tourist district, and started eschewing its reputation as the international hub for sex reassignment surgery.  

> This fame was cemented in the 1970s and 1980s thanks to a pioneering surgeon, the late Dr S. S. Ratnam. In 1987, however, hospitals were asked to stop performing such surgery, citing the risk of staff contracting the Aids virus.  

> Still, 5 years later [ie. 1992], Chiang in his play *imagined that it would be more likely for the Government to boost tourist numbers by allowing an adults-only resort, Bugis World, than change its strict anti-gambling laws in favour of casinos.*

387,6,eacn9qb,t1_eachmfm,"> Wow, Singapore was actually tolerant then turned homophobic?  

Below are some historical-cultural traditions of the NE, SE & Southern Asia that might be of interest ...  

1) Taking Singapore's majority Chinese culture for instance, there are very famous transgender, non-binary & gender non-conforming characters in Chinese/Northeast Asian religious mythology, such as:-  

- [Lan Caihe](http://www.szdaily.com/content/2017-02/20/content_15420582.htm) of the Eight Immortals, who is apparently a feminine-presenting man who has been various described as [hermaphrodite or gender-fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lan_Caihe#Properties)  

- The much-venerated Buddhist bodhisattva Kwan Yin (""Goddess of Mercy""), who supposedly transformed/ changed sex from male to female. Throughout history, Kwan Yin has been [represented as either a male or female](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanyin#Iconography). There exist other regional-cultural variations to Kwan Yin ""sex change"" story. If we were to trace Kwan Yin back to its Indian origins, we can see that this religious figure is [depicted as a man](https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/great-powers-guanyin-all-seeing-compassionate-inspiration-006541), before the Chinese dynasties increasingly feminized the iconography.  

2) India's ancient temples used to liberally depict LGBT gods & goddesses as part of their decor, until the colonial British overlords started literally converting the general Indian populace into a homophobic society. And below is an Indian-centric perspective of LGBT history ...

**[The Myth of 'Asian Values', and Why Being Asian is Being Inclusive](http://ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-asian-values-lgbt-rights) (RICE - 18 Jul 2018)**  
> The presence of LGBT people in Hindu and Buddhist societies was widely acknowledged, and non-binary sexualities and gender identities were accepted as a natural manifestation of the diverse spectrum of human realities.  

> This means that LGBT people in not just India, but in the larger Indosphere, which is virtually all of modern-day ASEAN, were treated with respect, compassion, and were accorded their due rights. LGBT people were considered fellow sojourners on the road towards Mok·π£a or NirvƒÅ·πáa, not deviants or sinners.  

3) Within the Malay-Malesian archipelago, the [Bugis people are known to recognize at least 5 genders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_in_Bugis_society). And non gender/sexuality-typical individuals tend to be highly-regarded for their relative rarity & natural ability to transcend boundaries. Hence they are traditionally employed as shamans & priests.  

And where Malay & Indonesian languages are concerned, *nek* or *nenek* is historically used to refer to grandfather, grandmother, grandparents, or ancestors in general. However, the trend in more recent decades -- perhaps due to increasing Islamic conservatism (& its aversion to accepting overlapping gender lines) -- is to reserve *nenek/ nek* for grandmother, while grandfather is addressed as *atok/ atuk/ datuk/ eyang/ datuk*.

From: [A Dictionary of the Malayan Language](https://books.google.com/books?id=a91GAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA351&dq=nenek) (William Marsden) - 1812  
- *Nenek* = paternal grandfather  
- *Nenek perampuan* = paternal grandmother  
- *Nenek perampuan sablah ma* = maternal grandfather  
- *Nenek muyang/ puyang* = forefathers, ancestors  

From: [An Abridged Malay-English Dictionary (Romanised)](https://books.google.com/books?id=8SESAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA151&dq=nenek) (Richard James Wilkinson) - 1961  
- *Nenek* = grandfather, grandmother  
- *Nenek moyang* = ancestors  

On a related note, one might have heard of a historical personality called *Nek Siam* (""Grandfather Siam""), or even visited his keramat-tomb on the peak of Bukit Betung (also interchangeably known as Bukit Siam) at Bangka Belitung, off Sumatra, Indonesia. Here's a [video-clip of *Nek Siam*'s tomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-duTjeJ1c&t=1m16s) -- it's in Indonesian, but those not conversant with the language can probably still catch some keywords.  

Background: *Nek Siam* -- nicknamed *Eyang Kembang* (""Grandfather Flower"") -- is a revered holy man & famous silat warrior in Indonesian folklore. He was apparently Hakka-Thai with the birthname Lee Kun Chai, & later adopted Sufi Islam as his religion. The placename Bukit Betung itself was named after *Nek Siam*'s fellow warrior & Indonesian life-partner *Atok Betung* (""Grandfather Betung"").  

In fact, there is a children's picture book *Asal Mula Bukit Betung dan Bukit Siam* (""Origin of Bukit Betung and Bukit Siam"") -- [PDF eBook (in Indonesian)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6ePVweRjZveLTFpTjNOREhpSlU/view) -- about the folkloric story of the famous male couple who inspired the placename Bukit Betung/Siam, & the abandoned baby they found & brought up as their own child.

The book is published in 2014 by Badan Perpustakaan dan Arsip Daerah (""Regional Library & Archives"") of Provinsi Kepulauan Bangka Belitung (""Province of Bangka Belitung Islands"").",t3_9zu63l,24-11-2018

> SINGAPORE: Egged on by his friend and feeling bored, a teenager spat over the railing on the fourth floor of a mall in Bugis towards diners in the basement.

> This was in late February, when Singapore had just entered Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) orange level in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Polytechnic student Cai Jiaxu, 18, pleaded guilty on Wednesday (Jul 15) to one charge of public nuisance by spitting at Bugis Junction on Feb 28.

> The court heard that Cai was with two friends - 17-year-old Gerald Chan Weiheng and 19-year-old Jolin Huang Rui Xian - at Bugis Junction shopping mall on Feb 28.

> The trio were at the fourth floor of the mall between 5pm and 7pm when Cai suddenly thought of spitting over the railing to the lower floors ""as he was bored and wanted to see how his friends would react"", the court heard.

> ""He told Gerald about this twice and asked him to hit his head to make it look accidental,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Gail Wong.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The second time Cai told Gerald about this, Ms Huang heard the conversation and took out her handphone to record the act.

> She egged Gerald on, asking him to slap Cai's head and telling the pair that she was recording their actions.

> Cai looked over the railing and saw that there were about six to seven people below, dining at the Subway restaurant on the lower floor.

> With Ms Huang filming, Gerald slapped the back of Cai's head and Cai spat over the railing in the direction of the Subway customers at Basement 1.

> He did this knowing that his act would probably cause annoyance to the public and to the people on the lower floors.

> After this, the trio left the mall. Ms Huang later posted the video in a group chat with their friends in it, and she and Gerald later posted the clip on their personal Instagram accounts. They deleted the posts at around 10.30pm that same day, but the clip had already been circulated.

> VIDEO CIRCULATED, MALL MAKES POLICE REPORT

> The video was posted on a public Instagram account on Mar 1, with the word ""idiots"" written into the caption. It had drawn more than 13,000 page views as of Jul 8.

> In the video, Gerald is seen wearing a white top and looking over the railing before hitting Cai in the head. The video then pans downwards to the people on the lower floors.

> The mall did not receive complaints of spittle landing on diners or observations of spittle, said the prosecutor.

> However, a representative for the mall lodged a police report on Mar 3 over the clip, concerned that the spittle could have landed on diners. The three teenagers were later arrested.

> The clip on the public Instagram account drew comments from members of the public concerned about hygiene and public health risks.

> One commenter said that if the person spitting had coronavirus, more people would get it.

> At the time of the offence, the COVID-19 outbreak had been widely reported in the media, and Singapore had entered DORSCON Orange.

> ""By this time, the Ministry of Health was already issuing daily advisories on the COVID-19 infection numbers and situation, with reminders to observe good personal hygiene, wear a mask and cover one‚Äôs mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, to limit the spread of the disease,"" said the prosecutor.

> The judge called for a report to assess Cai's suitability for probation and adjourned sentencing to Aug 26.

> For committing public nuisance, he could be jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$2,000 or both.

> Another three teenagers have been arrested in connection with a spitting incident.

> The three teenagers, aged between 16 and 18, were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly spitting over the railing in a Bugis shopping mall.

> The police said in a statement yesterday they received a report that a male victim was on the ground floor of the shopping mall in Victoria Street when spittle from a higher floor landed on him.

> Investigations showed that three boys spat over the railing from the fifth floor of the mall last Thursday, some time after 5pm. With the help of police cameras, officers from the Central Police Division established the identities of the suspects.

> The teenagers are being investigated for being a public nuisance.

> The police said the incident caused alarm and annoyance in the light of the coronavirus outbreak, since infections can spread indirectly through contaminated surfaces.

> The arrests come in the wake of a number of other similar incidents also involving teenagers.

> Last Thursday, two boys and one girl, aged between 17 and 19, were arrested over a suspected spitting incident in a shopping mall in central Singapore.

> Last month, two teenage boys aged 12 and 17 were apprehended for allegedly spitting inside public lifts in Housing Board blocks.

> This was after two separate reports, on Feb 23 and 25, of spittle being found on the mirrors and buttons inside the lifts of HDB blocks in Punggol Walk and Ang Mo Kio Street 32.

> In another case, police quizzed three 15-year-olds after SBS Transit lodged a police report on Feb 20 when spittle was found on the buttons of a lift at Rumbia LRT station.

> The teenagers are being investigated for an offence of mischief. Investigations showed that the offence was committed on Feb 19 at about 6.10pm. Anyone found guilty of being a public nuisance can be fined up to $2,000.

> If the public nuisance act is found to have caused or will probably cause common injury, danger or annoyance to the public, those found guilty can be jailed for up to three months, fined up to $2,000, or both.

> If convicted of mischief, they can be jailed for up to two years, or fined, or both.

> Those under the age of 16 cannot be jailed.

> ""Everyone needs to play their part by observing good personal hygiene and being socially responsible,"" the police said yesterday.

> SINGAPORE - CapitaLand has won the tender for the integrated management of Bugis Village and Bugis Street, and is exploring plans for new retail concepts for the area including a day-to-night market and a retail incubator.

> The award has an initial tenancy term of three years starting from April 1 this year. The lease may be renewed for a further two terms of three years each, and a final term not extending beyond March 30, 2030.

> Existing tenants at Bugis Village and Bugis Street can continue to operate under CapitaLand for a year at the prevailing rent until March 31, 2021, Singapore's biggest landlord said in a media release on Thursday (Jan 16).

> The integrated Bugis Village and Bugis Street is located next to Bugis+ and opposite Bugis Junction, both malls owned by the CapitaLand group and linked to Bugis MRT interchange station.

> The tender was jointly awarded by the Singapore Land Authority, Singapore Tourism Board and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The project has a proposed retail net lettable area (NLA) of about 195,000 sq ft.

> The bid was evaluated using the price-quality method, which took into consideration the quality of the proposal in enhancing the vibrancy of the Bras Basah-Bugis precinct, price and the bidder's experience and track record, among other criteria.

> To enhance the connectivity of Bugis Village and Bugis Street, CapitaLand is exploring a new link bridge connecting Bugis Street to Bugis+ to provide visitors with sheltered access from Bugis MRT station.

> It is also exploring plans for new retail concepts for the integrated Bugis Village and Bugis Street that will complement existing offerings in the area. These include a day-to-night market, a retail incubator and shared economy spaces such as co-living and co-working areas.

> A section of the revamped Bugis Village and Bugis Street will be turned into a hub offering established brands and new entrants a retail incubator space to innovate new ways of creating curated brand experiences or pilot new concepts.

> Related Story Influence of Bugis in many place names

> Related Story Bugis Cube up for collective sale at $230m reserve price

> To add on to the retail experience, a series of loose and colourful container boxes with open display areas will be introduced, said CapitaLand.

> ""This is a modern interpretation of street markets where tourists and shoppers enjoy memorable encounters with trendy Instagrammable bites, quirky gifts and trending fashion accessories,"" it said.

> The company added that homegrown heritage brand names will be invited to launch experiential concept stores and cuisine unique to Bugis.

> ""Diners can learn about local favourites and try their hands at making these dishes on the spot or take home a piece of Singapore's food culture with products like laksa paste or bak kut teh soup packs,"" said the company.

> Mr Keith Tan, STB chief executive, said: ""The Bugis Village and Bugis Street site is a key landmark in the Bras Basah-Bugis precinct. The new ideas and concepts by CapitaLand will enhance the street market concept and make the entire district more vibrant and interesting for locals and tourists. This supports the government's ongoing efforts to rejuvenate various areas in Singapore.""

> CapitaLand's plans for the area are subject to change and pending authority approval.

> Related Story Less than a year before lease runs out for Bugis Village tenants

> Mr Ronald Tay, chief executive officer of CapitaLand Singapore, Malaysia & Indonesia, residential & retail, said: ""Our bid for the integrated management of Bugis Village and Bugis Street is in line with CapitaLand's precinct strategy to rejuvenate and maximise synergy in areas where we have an existing network and competitive advantage.""

> The addition of Bugis Village and Bugis Street, will raise CapitaLand's retail NLA in the precinct to over 800,000 sq ft, enabling it to scale up cross-marketing opportunities, said Mr Tay.

>          SINGAPORE - A dispute over a taxi erupted among eight people at a Bugis shopping mall in the early hours of Saturday morning (Jan 13).
The incident, which happened at a taxi stand at Bugis Cube at around 1am, left a woman in her 20s with a wound on her right thigh.
The police said it was alerted to a case of voluntarily causing hurt at 470, North Bridge Road, at 1.03am. A Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) spokesman said that a woman sustained minor injuries.
An ambulance was dispatched to the location but the woman declined to be taken to the hospital.
The Straits Times understands that the dispute arose after a group of four women left the building and were headed towards a taxi stand. They had been unaware that another group, comprising two men and two women, were also waiting for a taxi outside the building.
When one of the four women tried to board a taxi, she was confronted by a man from the other group, who turned aggressive and began pulling her hair.
Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Wanbao reported that the two groups were soon embroiled in a fight, before a security guard across the road alerted the police.
However, it was reported that the group of two men and two women had left the scene before police officers arrived.
According to Lianhe Wanbao, the four women had visited a nearby karaoke lounge before the incident.
Investigations are ongoing.
