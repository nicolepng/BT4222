Hahaha, it's casual fast food man. It's just that Singapore is such an affluent market that premium prices can be charged for just about anything (proven not by our opinions and anecdotes but by the actual queues).

26,2,fdh4l39,t1_fdgbxrg,"1) Lombardo's (Tanjong Pagar Conservation Area) is quite pricey at $21 upwards for a burger alone but I'd say they do execute a proper burger. A few months ago, there was an $18 promo on Chope which included a burger and fries. It doesn't seem to be there anymore but you can keep this place in mind at least for when a deal comes around again. 

Medium-rare patty done correctly. Buns are soft and fluffy. Fries are good too. Only thing is that the prices w/o promos is kinda killer...


2) Two Blur Guys (Orchid Hotel, Tanjong Pagar) is another good place to start. Ambience & seating arrangement abit more cramped and no-frills compared to Lombardos in exchange for slightly lower prices. 

But they definitely do a good burger too. The patty here is smaller in circumference (can't think of a better way to word this) but taller in height. This allows for them to more consistently achieve medium-rare done-ness on their patties, which leads to juicy af burgers. 

3) Burger Buddies (The atas foodcourt at Pinnacle @ Duxton, Tanjong Pagar) is another one to consider. Prices are around a little lower than Two Blur Guys. Their mushroom sauce on their mushroom burger is dope af. 

However, even tho they'll ask for your preferred done-ness, they seem to have trouble actually executing it properly/consistently. I have to order my burger batty rare here in order for them to hit somewhere slightly higher than medium-rare. Decent place but their consistency a bit not there.

PSA: Hans Im Gluck is wack. Burgers are quite big but the patties are weak. Can't specify done-ness + texture similar to McMuffin patty (???). Go there for the nice deco and fries but don't expect a good burger there. Legit rather have Carl's Jr over Hans Im Gluck.",t3_el6e07,07-01-2020

41,2,fdjc9sw,t1_fdj9j4f,"Yeah it's pricey, I was in London and 5 guys there was even slightly more expensive than here too.
