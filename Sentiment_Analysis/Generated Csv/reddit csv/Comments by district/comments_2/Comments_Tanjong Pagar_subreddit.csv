224,2,gnnki6y,t3_ll3zj2,"As other comments have mentioned, pure methanol burns extremely clean. There is almost no smoke emitted. It might have ignited on impact and spread through the fuel tank, which caused the ignition of gasoline. (Visible flames caught on camera)

Here is an example: [Methanol: A Completely Clean Burning Fuel - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAkz9S55zsk)Time stamp @ 1:05

Cars don't usually burst into flame like this. Not with that amount of delay when the fuel tank is damaged. There might be a car modification done on it.(Meth injection)

It seems that the car has bled off a lot of speed before the crash. Modern day crumple zone are actually really good at absorbing impact. One might wonder if all of that can be avoided.

242,2,gnuz43b,t3_ll3zj2,"It is interesting seeing this video after my comment a few days ago.

The fuel tank definitely ruptured. That is for sure. The collision did not look that severe. Cars tend to lose speed rapidly when in an over steer condition. The speed at the point of impact is likely less than 60km/h. This is likely well within the design parameters for a car's rear crash structure. I would be very interested to see if the systems in place to protect the tank from a rear end collision worked as designed, because it looks to me like this should have been survivable. If this was an expected outcome, we would be seeing slow driving Tai Tais getting burned to death every time they get rear ended. We would see this everyday if this was the case. So who fucked up?  


If there was a Water Methanol system, a burst tank would likely explain how we ended up with this near explosive spread of the fire as methanol is easily vaporized and much more likely to generate an explosion which would set all the spilled fuel on fire. These tanks are typically less than 2 gallons in size and fit in the boot of the car. If the tank was properly secured and well made, it does not seem that likely for the tank to go up like this in a relatively low speed collision. If I were LTA, I would be very interested to see if the shop that installed it did everything properly. Very interested.",t3_ll3zj2,18-02-2021

All these friends at the sidewalk also had to witness the burning wreck for a few good minutes while waiting for help to arrive. And they know their friends were already gone.

They very likely got whiplashed, with a good chance of unconsciousness. But even if they were conscious, 15 seconds is not a lot of time to get out considering how disoriented they must have been. 

Overall a very tragic incident. Say what you want about them “deserving it” and being foolish. Being an avid driver myself, (M22), it is easy to do such things without thinking of the consequences. For the consequences of such things, unfortunately, are only learned through hindsight- something that these guys did not have. Not everyone is lucky enough to have walked away from an accident. Do bear in mind that everyone makes mistakes, some more costly than others. So if you comment nasty comments like these, i should expect you to have not made a single mistake in your life. Also, do think about what you would have done in that situation (your friends are burning in a car) instead of ridiculing their actions.

Edit: Okok it's just a theory. Here goes:

1. Methanol burns emitting radiation, just not a lot in the visible spectrum. The orange flame you see from ""normal"" fires is the soot (carbon) burning, which burning methanol does not produce.
2. Camera sensors can be tuned to different wavelengths. Night vision cameras for example are sensitive to infrared, not visible spectrum.
3. I don't know for sure what this camera is sensitive to but my guess is it's an infrared camera because a. it's a security camera. b. it's seeing 5am like it's daytime.
4. Burning methanol does not emit infrared radiation. BUT, the camera would still pick up the black-body radiation from the air around the burning methanol being heated up. That's what's showing on the camera.",t3_ll3zj2,16-02-2021

If you've seen the full gruesome video, at some points people are just walking around the with no reaction to poor Raybe being on fire. Any sensible person would try and pat out the flames or react to someone being on fire, but the fact that several people did not, points to the flame being very not visible.

So there would have been visible flames on the car, but nothing close to what we see on the night camera - which shows both.  And it would have been much darker than that, making the methanol fire even harder to detect. What we see on the video is almost close to daylight due to IR vision on the cam. 

And almost certainly Raybe ran out with a methanol fire on her. Black shirt guy poured water on her to put out the visible burning flame on her clothes, but could not see the methanol fire.

I think by the time black shirt guy and Raybe ran up, you could already see visible flame, but not the larger methanol fire all around.

600,2,gnr2i6z,t1_gnqzbfp,"In fairness, it can be when you consider load transfer effects. 

I mentioned earlier that you lose traction with more weight. This is because traction is a function of how much mass you need to accelerate vs your frictional force. Your frictional force is your normal force (weight) × your frictional coefficient. It's the coefficient that drops with increasing weight. However, your frictional force will still go up with increasing weight until the tyre gets fully saturated.

Under pure acceleration, the 911's weight distribution is beneficial for its RWD drivetrain because the same amount of mass will need to be accelerated regardless of the vehicle's weight distribution. The rear heavy weight distribution will therefore allow the drive wheels to generate more force to aid in acceleration.

Cornering is where the heavy rearward weight distribution starts to get sketchy because heavy rear weight distribution also means more mass on the rear axle that the car needs to accelerate laterally into the corner. This is why it needs those really fat tyres and ultra wide track width.

Furthermore, if you are using a camera in IR night mode you dont have color except monochrome, so if your CCTV has color it probably has an IR cut filter over it.

Furthermore, methanol burns pale blue, near the ultraviolet end of the electromagnectic spectrum, which is on the opposite end of infrared.

Ignore the downvoting. I don't have a problem telling my story. I'll edit this with an update in a bit.  
  
EDIT: So got burned at age 5 by a BBQ. I was splashed with burning accelerant and up I went. Spent about 6 months in hospital  (I went to school in hospital) and multiple surgeries including skin grafts. At school I had to wear an arm brace which kept my arm extended out from my body at 90 degrees. Subtle...  when swimming at the public pool I had to wear long sleeves in the days before sun smart so did I ever stand out at the pool. More stares etc.

Got through the horrible teenage years by building all sorts of mental walls around  myself. High school was not a fun time. Obviously developed self-confidence issues. Developed undiagnosed depression at Uni.  At the end of high school I had more surgery (they had to wait until I stopped growing) including more skin grafts. One was to relieve pressure on my neck as the scars were pulling one side of my face down. 
  
By the time I hit adulthood all the defenses I built up had become liabilities. I've had enough therapy I should be awarded an honorary degree but actually none of it helped much at the time. So still lots of unresolved issues while putting a brave face on everything. Finally got diagnosed for depression after a breakdown over work stress. 
Had a big life event (another long story) which basically made me mentally to a 90 degree turn at which point everything 'clicked' to where it should be and over around 12 months I suddenly became far more ""me"".   
  
The thing which was really the biggest effect was the support, or lack of, from those around me. My family was super repressed which really was the root cause of a lot.of issues. Empathy, the support and love of those around you, psychological safety are really the things that cure you. The physical you can leave to the doctors.",t3_lqditn,23-02-2021
700,2,gogvjol,t1_goguaam,"Ah well no but sometimes yes. There's a bit of physiology here. Most burns affect the top layers of skin and most nerve endings are much deeper than that. In the top layers of your skin there's sweat glands and pain receptors which pressure ""corpuscles"" in deeper and your standard nerves deeper again. So in many places I don't feel any touch/pain sensation because of that but o do feel pressure. OTOH, I've lost sweat glands so I do have problems with body heat regulation sometimes. 
In some other spots I've actually lost muscle which was burned away but not deep enough to affect nerves.  
  
In severe burn cases you will get nerve damage in the extremities but in those cases you're often looking at amputation as well. Fingers being pretty common of course.

She rushed to a gasoline fire (probably from a breached fuel tank) to save her boyfriend and as gasoline fire do, the fumes can mix with oxygen and create an explosion, spraying her with flaming gasoline and burn her.

If you see a vehicle on fire, get as far away and as fast away as possible. The people stuck in it are basically done for. As you can see, gasoline fire is extremely fast. Unless you happen to have head-to-toe fire resistant clothing on you, don't bother. Even if you have a fire extinguisher and want to help, don't. Run away. 

What the fire extinguisher will be useful for is, for example, to put out fires on the humans, and then you drag them away from the fire and soon-to-be-explosion.

The remaining question I have is whether the occupants in the burning car had their seat belts on and if they do, how capable they were to be able to run away. If they hadn't had seat belts on, they would have been too broken to even move. At this point, they are all melted into the car so I'm not sure we can know that.",t3_ll8zma,17-02-2021

The crush structure in the front of the car has not been activated The left appears OK although it is hard to confirm. The A and C pillars have been cut by Emergency responders to allow access to the deceased.  It appears that the actual speed at impact with the pillar was low. While they were driving recklessly prior to the accident and speed was an important reason behind the collision, the actual damage to the car does not suggest a high speed collision as the driver likely braked very hard prior to impact.

The fire appears to have spread very rapidly and breached the passenger compartment. Given the height of the kerb, it is likely that undercarriage damage to the vehicle would have been significant and caused a failure of the fuel tank. Even so, automotive fuel systems should be very well protected and the occupants should also be protected from this type of near explosive failure even if the tank lets go. I am surprised that we can have a failure like this and with this sort of consequences.

I know that at the moment the narrative is fixated on the reckless behavior of the victims. That is mostly justified. But we also have to recognize that the vehicle may not have protected its occupants to its design standard.  I hope that there is a proper investigation that establishes the following:

\-How fast was this car going at the moment it came in contact with obstacles?

\- How did we end up with a fire that spread this quickly?

\-Were there failures of the vehicle in this accident? And if so, was BMW responsible? Did modifications to the vehicle contribute? ( I saw a pre crash video of them driving that car. It did not sound stock)?

Edit: Here is another one that has come to mind: There was a female who was severely injured when the car erupted as she was trying to open the doors. Why was she unsuccessful? All modern cars will have the doors unlock if the airbags deploy. Why was it so difficult for the occupants to escape?

I think that there is at least a 50-50 chance that there is some sort of vehicle failure involved in this.

If there was improper cutting or welding to install a ( generally bigger) modded exhaust system, It is possible that this could have contributed to this. 

Also, lets not let BMW off the hook also. Design or manufacturing error is also possible. BMWs is facing a class action lawsuit in the US over several hundred often massive vehicle fires ( though mostly seem to have occurred while the vehicle was parked). Some of these fires have spread so quickly that people's homes were burned down. BMW still has no idea why its cars randomly catch fire. BMW also had an ongoing recall campaign affecting over a million vehicles for a bad fuel system heater that has also been linked to a number of large fires. 

Unlike some redditors, German made should not automatically cause one to assume that something is good.

One of my big gripes about Singaporean political culture is that we waaay to quick to accept consumer misuse or negligence as the termination point of our inquiries when we should also be looking if business and governmental institutions were also doing things that contributed to a disaster.

Also, no. it seems very very unlikely that the car had been modded with dangerous fuels. To get a modern engine to run optimally off of very high octane fuels will likely require a new ECU Map and a completely new fuel system.  Many practical high octane fuels have very high alcohol contents. This would be a very extensive job.Given that the BMW is a Direct injection car, this is likely impossible for a Singaporean Tuner. Also, finding such fuels in Singapore is likely difficult

1047,2,gn8ukp6,t1_gn8eu9k," Here is what needs to be done. In this order. 

-You need to keep yourself and bystanders safe. 

-You need to call emergency services

- You need to get the victims away from imminent danger. This imminent danger in this case may progress fast enough that emergency services will not respond in time. While balancing risk to yourself.


I would do. In this order. 

-Delegate. You don't have much time and you cannot do everything yourself. You must find someone who will call 995. Find someone to get a fire extinguisher ( or ideally several). You must be specific. Go up to someone. Grab their shoulder. Tell them exactly and forcefully, what you need and have them specifically agree and quickly repeat it back to you. Otherwise the bystander effect will kick in. If doing something is ""SOMEONE'S"" responsibility, then NO ONE will do it. If it is ""YOUR"" responsibility then it will get done. 

- Try to forcefully open the doors. You will not be able to 'bend' open a door. A modern car's door beam is one of the thickest pieces of metal in a car because it has to withstand a T-bone collision.  The flipside is that the dot latches and hinges will often still be intact and you allow to open the door even if the outside panel has been damaged. If the door is still locked or jammed, break the window.--this is not easy. You will need tools to break the window. You will need something small, hard and heavy that you can swing fast at the window.--Like a hammer or brick. Once you break the window, try unlocking the door and opening it from the inside. Regardless, of that, you should be prepared for the possibility that you may need to cut the seatbelts to free them. Seatbelt locking mechanism are designed to fail-safe such that the seat belt cannot be released from clasp. The same thing occurs with the spool mechanism In Singapore, where you are not allowed to carry a foldable knife, this is going to be challenging. There is a strong possibility that freeing the victims without equipment is going to be hard. But you should try if you can do so safely. You will fail at everything you don't try at.

Also this is why you also have people calling SCDF and fighting the fire. The former ensures that the cavalry is coming and latter buys the victims time. This is why teamwork is very important.

-Car fires are often fed by burning liquids. If you have a fire extinguisher, the jet of the extinguisher should be directed at openings in the car's bodywork, such as the front grill and opening created by accident damage. It should also be directed under the vehicle where burning liquids tend to pool. Simply spraying the outside of the car is wasteful as the body work will shield the fire from the extinguishing chemical. A fire extinguisher has a finite amount of chemical. It must be used accurately. And if you quickly can get several extinguishers lined up, taken from near by buildings, so much the better. 

You will not have much time and so you must work concurrently. Half of you need to be trying to get people out. The other half need to be trying to knock back the fire.

I hope you never have to try this. I hope it gives you an understanding of what you ( and our SCDF guys) are up against. If you and your fellow bystanders can get it together to intervene to save someone from this, I salute all of you. I also have the highest respect for our SCDF guys who are doing this everyday. Those frontliners are heroes.

Edit: It has come to my attention that the female victim was not an occupant, but was a rescuer that was severely burned when the car suddenly went up. It has also come to my attention that the BMW in this story may have been equipped with an MW system. MW system and Nox systems typically contain unusually combustible chemicals. Nox systems are often pressurised. These are typically built to far lower safety standards than say fuel tanks LNG powered vehicles. I would not attempt a rescue on such a vehicle unless I had special equipment and training.",t3_lixos8,13-02-2021
1048,2,gnccidw,t1_gnboh4q,"Yeah, it certainly can. That said the effect of overloading will be small compared to some of the alleged modifications that were also allegedly badly executed.

The effect will also be small compared to the likely disabling of the electronic driver aids.

I think the presence of the fifth passenger is more likely to have an effect on injuries and the ability of the occupants to escape. It is almost certain that he was an unrestrained  passenger which makes it likely that he became a projectile during the crash, or even during emergency manoeuvres.",t3_lixos8,14-02-2021
1049,2,gn9cv1x,t1_gn94q50,"Thanks.   


We must be careful about jumping to conclusions. We should wait for an investigation while stating an expectation that it be done thoroughly.  


  
 [https://youtu.be/3iqPgTrx8wo?t=25](https://youtu.be/3iqPgTrx8wo?t=25)

I just saw a video that CNA put up. The left side of the car appears to have relatively limited damage. It appears that collision damage to the front and sides are relatively limited. That said, the sides of a car don't have crumple zones. You can hit the side of a car at moderate speed and yet have limited visible damage. A frontal collision at that same moderate speed would start crushing the energy absorbing structure in the front a car and produce more visible damage. That said, a side impact of over 80km/h would produce very dramatic results and we are not seeing this. The question I have in mind in this:  


 Given that we don't seem to see a catastrophic failure of the car's structure, how did the fuel system go up and why were the occupants not able to escape? From what I understand, the female victim was desperately trying to help the victims escape when the car suddenly went up and was completely engulfed in flames, setting her on fire also. This is scary and should not happen. So what caused this? 

Given limited damage to the car's structure, it is likely that the impact speed was at worst, only moderate. If this is the case and the cause of this fire was a failure of the stock vehicle, this post accident outcome likely could happen to anyone. 

&#x200B;

Also, I would not read too much into the M4 and RWD angle. I doubt the driver was powersliding the car through China-town. That would take some talent to achieve and talented people tend not to drive their expensive sports cars into a pillar at 5am. In the absence of someone deliberately doing things like that you will not get an M4 to accidentally oversteer ( especially on a dry road) unless we are talking about some really inexplicable series of events. Most road cars,including the performance oriented models are set up for terminal understeer. The tendency of a car to oversteer and understeer is a product of more than just which wheels are driven. The weight distribution ( the M4 is a front engined car), tires and suspension are even more important.  Most manufacturers set their cars up for understeer because this is safer. A car that is understeering will return to a neutral attitude as speed is reduced.--and understeer tends to cause a loss of speed. This is not true for a car that is oversteering. This is before we consider the effects of electronic driving aids that all will try to get the car to ( slightly) understeer.",t3_lixos8,13-02-2021
1050,2,gn9nwe7,t1_gn9hn57,"That being said, there are things in the message that don't make sense. The typical way you get a wide rim on is by using a spacer. You would not typically do a large camber adjustment to get a rim to fit. The car also does not look stanced and the body work appears stock. The front rims look stock also. So who knows about the suspension damage allegation and so on.

That said, the MW system is plausible given how quickly the car burned.

I sometimes feel that things in Singapore are restricted enough to become very expensive/inconvenient and cause a lot of collateral damage to people behaving responsibly. And yet not restricted enough that siaolang like this are even remotely deterred. And when these people create problems, guess who has to face all the restrictions?

1052,2,gnnsxsa,t1_gn9hn57,"Methanol mods are 50/50 methanol water (usually, if not very close) and difficult to burn. The fire didn't start from methanol mods, even if it was pure methanol. Methanol burns invisible. You can't see it with the naked eye or on camera. It wouldn't have exploded if mixed with water. 

It's used to raise the octane of your cylinder and provide cooling so you don't have detonations in high temperature high compression cylinders.

Clearly the flames are orange. That's a gasoline fire that probably happened because the car's first hard impact was at the rear amd ruptured the gas tank. That gasoline probably leaked onto or close to the exhaust system, which is extremely hot and wicked its way back to the tank, engulfing the car in flame. 

Go research ethanol flames from basic science class, it does not burn orange. 

People going on about methanol causing the fire don't know how methanol mods actually work.",t3_lixos8,16-02-2021

The frame around the passenger cell is very very strong and would typically be the last structural part of the car to begin to distort in an accident. This is by design. Having a strong passenger cell protects the occupants by creating a survival space, by ensuring that occupants are not pinned in the car and are able to egress by opening a door so that they can receive medical assistance immediately. Being able to open a door after a collision is an important element of crash testing standards around the world. A door that cannot be opened in the even of a crash that leave most of the body work intact raises important questions. This is not supposed to happen.

\-Were the doors able to unlatch and open? If not why?   


This accidents raises many questions because the accident seems mostly survivable, but ended with everyone on board getting killed. It is important to find out if all safety critical vehicle systems performed as designed even if the vehicle was misused. Its possible, even likely, that one of your guesses provides much of the answer, but we don't get a better safety culture by blaming the user, throwing up motherhood statements and not conducting a thorough and open minded investigation. It is important that we express this because there is a pre-existing tendency in Singaporean culture to do this. ( See what happens with all the SAF safety problems).

Are you fucking kidding me? Yes, yes there is a fucking need to pile on.

This wasn't just _an accident_. It wasn't like the car brake's malfunctioned and slammed into an oncoming car killing everyone. This was a fucking idiot driver who thought it would be a great idea to speed for 10 minutes right in the middle of the CBD where people eat, drink and party until late. This fucking idiot driver put himself, put his friends, and put anyone else in the nearby vicinity at risk.

""_An accident_"" didn't kill them. ""_A mistake_"" did not kill them. Speeding was what killed everybody. Many people analyzed the footage and estimated the car was in excess of 180km/h. You don't ""_accidentally_"" drive up to 180km/h. Just like you don't play with fire or with guns because they are deadly and they kill, you do not play with speed either.

So no. I will not shut up about not having any sympathy. Not when this fucking idiot of a driver puts himself and so many others in danger.

And no, I will not feel bad for any of the friends who were there that day. Because maybe, just maybe, one of them should have said something instead of fucking shutting up. ""Hey you shouldn't speed, it's dangerous"". ""Hey you shouldn't get in the car, it's dangerous"". But because nobody said anything and instead encouraged his reckless behaviour, he is dead, killed 4 of his friends and critically injured his fiance.

Just because he's dead doesn't mean he gets a free pass for people to not criticize his actions. More people need to condemn and demonize his behaviour, and hopefully this will discourage others from repeating his footsteps.",t3_lixos8,13-02-2021

1190,2,gnibf57,t1_gni4tnw,"There is speculation that a major contributing factor to this accident was an aftermarket MW system in the boot of the car. I think this is plausible and the rest of my commentary is predicated on this being true. But I stress, that this is still unconfirmed.)I hear you. As someone who works on his own vehicles in the US pretty extensively and has built racing cars ( Formula sae etc), this is a field where you need competent, careful and meticulous people with some appreciation for engineering. Automakers might have billions of dollars, but they often face complicated internal  engineering and cost saving goals that would prevent them from giving you the most optimal component for your needs.  Cars are typically designed to be serviced. Many wear components are specced with huge margins of safety. If you a having things break, you ( or your mechanic) are either pushing things too far or something was really badly installed. If you understand the engineering and work with some level of care, you can minimize and manage the risk. The problem is that we have far too many bad actors who are too busy chasing a quick buck to do this for their customers.

I don't mean to sound elitist, but I don't think the driver in this case had the background to understand what he was getting into.  And the fucking gian lui shop who installed the mods failed in its duty of care to advise the customer about the risk and refuse this request. The shop also probably made multiple errors in installation, knowing the jiak liao bee people in this industry. I am not surprised you have had this experience.

Speaking of risk management. A road car is not a first place for experimentation. I think that you would have to be insane to daily drive your semi experimental MW injection equipped rig on public roads. You would have to be off the wall to go overload it with friends to go clubbing. This is unbelievably irresponsible. I wonder if the shop even told him not to do something like that. I think it is more likely that the customer did not know than it is a case where this customer, while reckless, was willing to take suicidal risks driving around with a tank full of methanol.

In the US, there is a large culture of people mod their cars , but those that are doing it responsibly trailer the car to whatever SCCA event or what not they are  going to. If they are racing, Helmets and roll cages apply. The risk is manageable if most people are sensible. And the gate keepers of that culture are the shops.

I really blame the shops. I get it Singapore's car culture is sort of stunted in its development. Very few Singaporeans outside the industry have automotive engineering knowledge. (And a surprising number of people in the industry have none!)  You are a going to be dealing with enthusiastic and moneyed consumers who may not be fully educated in what they are getting into. You have a duty to your customer and the public. Even if you are completely greedy and selfish, it is in your absolute self interest to not kill your customers, outrage the public and invite a crackdown. If you have some dumb customer who wants an water methanol system in his only car or his daily driver because he read about it somewhere, you need to be able to resist the temptation of money and tell him that you won't do it and why its dangerous to him and the public.

I think one of the reasons for your experience with this is that the whole automotive sales and services industry here is fully of sharks. They guy working on your vehicle likely is not performing the basic QC checks to make sure everything is done correctly. Really egregious failures commonly slip through them and get discovered after hand off to the customer. This is assuming you aren't the victim of outright fraud where you are billed for services that are not performed. Tuning and modification are often done by people who have no real understanding of the engineering principles behind what they are doing and don't consider the big engineering picture. This is how you end up with a shop selling an MW system to a customer and putting it in his daily driver and/or only car.  They are only interested in your money.

Here is an example: You tell me how you wound up spilling enough fuel that the mechanic could follow you cartoon style on a motorbike? There are several things that must have gone wrong. It is likely that some of the hose fittings were 'improvised'. It is likely that these were improperly installed. Most importantly, it is likely the guy was too lazy to test drive your car to see if everything was in order before doing the handoff. This is something that could have happened to anyone, even if they weren't seeking to mod their cars. It is fucking dangerous.

This is why we need a stronger civil liability culture. The government cannot regulate everything law by law. And even if they did, the costs of government restrictions tend to fall on responsible people because the siao langs already don't care. If you want people to use their initiative to care about product and employees safety and to properly check the work that they do, its needs to be easier to sue the worst offenders.",t3_lixos8,15-02-2021
1191,2,gn9oggi,t1_gn9k7p0,"Its possible. But it would take more than just turning off driver aids to get that outcome. 

There is a rumour that the guy was driving around with an MW system, suspension mods as well as a damaged rear control arm. If he spun out on braking, I would be looking to see what was done to the suspension. Given the fire, I would be looking for evidence of that MW system. And if the installation of that and other components created problems for the safety of the fuel tank.

1193,2,gna3535,t1_gn9z0an,"I think it depends on what sort of failure we are talking about. If you have an engineering failure that occurs with a high probability, causes a catastrophic event but has a low probability trigger, most engineering risk management protocols would say that that is unacceptable, especially if the fix was of moderate cost. If the fix was unacceptably expensive, then other mititgations must be found. 

That said, you sound like you are making a general statement of faith in BMW's engineering. Let say that that faith is not warranted. BMW has an ongoing recall campaign encompassing over 1 million vehicles triggered by a wide variety of manufacturing and engineering defects that have been linked to hundreds of large and sudden vehicle fires.--though typically of parked cars. They are facing a massive class action lawsuit over hundreds of their cars catching fire in the US due to causes that BMW has been trying to uncover for years and still does not know why they happen.

No one is saying that the 5 guys weren’t wrong. We all know the whole tragedy was a result of their wrong choices. We. All. Know.

But 5 human lives are gone, and here we have throngs of “warriors” acting like they are so morally perfect and hence justified in meting out callous remarks and harsh opinions - on dead people who can neither defend themselves nor make up for their mistakes anymore. 

(Side note: no one asked for personal anecdotes of how y’all are so infallible and upright. Thanks for being good members of our society, but that doesn’t make you a moral authority or grant you any rights to bully or make personal attacks on people who simply asked if you could be kinder with your words.)

1292,2,gncxzqx,t3_ljicil,"> # 4D number 1441 sold out on Saturday & Sunday following Tanjong Pagar crash

> Singapore Pools stopped accepting bets on 4D number 1441 shortly after news of a BMW crashing into a vacant shophouse along Tanjong Pagar Road on Saturday, Feb. 13, 2021, spread across the island.

> The number was listed as sold out by early afternoon on the day of the incident.

> Singaporeans' morbid fascination with picking winning numbers was on show as they quickly laid bets on the number 1441, which is the licence plate number of the vehicle involved.

> The incident resulted in five deaths and one serious injury on the second day of Chinese New Year.

> Number sold out early

> According to an online betting slip, the 1441 4D number could not be processed as it was sold out on Saturday afternoon.

> Another attempt to placed a bet on the number on Sunday for the draw later in the evening also showed that it was already sold out, likely by Saturday.

> Why do 4D numbers sell out?

> Singapore Pools is known to restrict the total amount of bets wagered on a particular number as a way to curb its downside, in the event the number appears as one of the winning numbers.

> 1441 was not one of the winning numbers for the Saturday, Feb. 13 draw.

> Numbers selling out is normal

> Numbers selling out early on 4D draw days are common occurrences.

> But high-profile incidents have contributed to punters wagering bets in earnest quickly.

> A previous incident when a 4D number -- 5039 -- was sold out quickly was on Saturday, Aug. 13, 2016, when Joseph Schooling out-swam Olympic legend Michael Phelps to take the Olympic gold with a timing of 50.39 seconds.

> SINGAPORE - Seeing her boyfriend and friends trapped in the burning car, Ms Raybe Oh Siew Huey, 26, rushed forward to try and save them.

> But in doing so, she suffered severe burns on about 80 per cent of her body, and is now fighting for her life in the hospital.

> Her boyfriend, Mr Jonathan Long, 29, was driving the BMW that slammed into a Tanjong Pagar shophouse early Saturday morning (Feb 13).

> The couple is understood to have applied for a flat recently.

> Ms Oh is a former Singapore Airlines air stewardess, and also sang getai on occasion.

> Witnesses said the car caught fire within seconds of the crash.

> Mr Akira Chan, 21, a friend of the group, told ST Ms Oh was not in the car at the time, but rushed forward immediately to the burning wreck.

> ""She tried to open the door and was injured in the process,"" he said.

> ""She was trying to save her fiance.""

> Despite Ms Oh's efforts, Mr Long died at the scene with the four other men who were with him in the car.

> Ms Oh was conscious when taken to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) shortly after the crash at about 5.40am.

> A spokesman for SGH said she is now in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> It was previously reported that Ms Oh, who was born in Malaysia, began singing getai at the age of 16, and studied at a local polytechnic.

> She said in a 2013 interview with ST, while a polytechnic student, that she performed to earn money for school fees so she could lighten her father's financial burden.

> Getai organiser Aaron Tan, 45, told ST on Saturday he remembered meeting her during a flight in 2019, and that he last engaged her to perform in a virtual getai show last August.

> ""She started singing getai before becoming a flight stewardess, but kept mostly a low profile,"" he told ST.

> ""She had to stop for a while because of her new work commitments, but started performing again last year because of the pandemic.""

> He described Ms Oh as a quiet and petite person who appeared to be timid, but was actually very independent and had a big heart.

> Mr Tan added: ""As a getai community, we were shocked to hear of the news, and pray that she recovers.

> ""She did what she did for love, and it was a selfless act that not everybody could do. It was a commendable thing.""

1587,2,gn5387n,t3_litb7f,"SINGAPORE - A friend of one of the five victims in Saturday's horrific crash at Tanjong Pagar Road said a woman tried to save one of them and got burned doing so.

On Saturday (Feb 13) morning, five people were killed and one sent to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) after a car, a BMW, slammed into the front of a shophouse there.

The Singapore Civil Defence Force was alerted at about 5.40am.

Mr Akira Chan, 21, a friend of the victims, told The Straits Times one of the victims ran a popular Korean eatery in the area.

He said: ""They were at the restaurant around the time and were going back when the car skidded.

""The fiancée of one of my friends in the car tried to open the door to save him and was burned as a result.""

ST understands she suffered 80 per cent burns to her body and is being treated at the SGH burns unit.

Mr Chan, who spoke to ST at the accident scene, said his other friends who were at the restaurant at the time witnessed the accident and were assisting in police investigations.

The family members of the victims arrived at about 10.30am, and were believed to have identified the bodies before they were taken away to the mortuary.

They were heard wailing from about 30m away, across the road from the site of the crash.

They left the scene at about 11.30am and declined to speak to reporters.

A young woman among the group was seen breaking down by the side of the road, and the other family members appeared distraught.",t3_litb7f,13-02-2021

So I urge people to reconsider the necessity of their statements before making them- the ability to show compassion for the loss of life/ the loss of family is very separate and distinct from condemning the reckless driving. You can show empathy and kindness to people for losing their loved ones while disagreeing with the reckless action. Please think before choosing to say they ""deserved this""...

Whatever happened here is simple cause and effect aka karma. Suppose an innocent bystander was killed, the narrative will completely change. Just because no one was doesn’t mean the whole world needs to suddenly be compassionate towards a few stupid youngsters courting death. Saying they deserved it also doesn’t make anyone cruel, because it’s a normal reaction that anyone with some social consciousness will have.

> Five men, aged between 26 and 29, were killed in a car crash in Tanjong Pagar on Feb. 13.

> According to videos and eyewitnesses, the BMW that they were in was speeding along Tanjong Pagar Road.

> The car subsequently crashed into a vacant shophouse at 37 Tanjong Pagar Road.

> Video analysed

> A short 24 frames per second video of the car speeding prior to the crash has since been analysed in more detail.

> One person in Singapore, Ken Teng, claims that the BMW was travelling at 220km/hour before it crashed.

> Teng posted his video analysis on Facebook.

> He first took the amount of time it took for the BMW to travel down a stretch of Tanjong Pagar Road.

> He imported the video into Final Cut Pro, a video editing software, to get the time it took — about 1.16 seconds.

> ""This is not 100 per cent accurate but this is the best we can get,"" he clarified in his video.

> Teng then calculated the distance travelled by the BMW using Google Maps' ""Measure Distance"" function, which came up to be about 71.72 metres.

> The last step was putting in the values into the mathematical formula for calculating speed (Speed = Distance/time) which gave him 220km/h.

> Teng went on to show that the BMW had a ""long, straight way"" along Tanjong Pagar Road to accelerate to 200km/h before it reached the junction of Craig Road and Tanjong Pagar Road, which was where the speeding car was filmed.

> The speed limit along that stretch of Tanjong Pagar Road is 50km/h.

> Unfortunately, Teng's video has been taken down as of writing time.

> You can still view his video on Singapore Uncensored.

1840,2,gnpd85u,t3_lk7r30,"I’m surprised that no one is pointing out that 220km/h is way too fast for it to be true. His calculations are based on eyeballing from the start point to the end point of “where he couldnt see the car anymore”.

Perhaps a better way to really find out would be to look at the road strips and calculate distance and time based on what is seen in the video, or perhaps breakdown how many fps the video was and calculate it based on the length of a single strip of the road.

Gauging speed as a bystander is really difficult visually. Though from my experience with fast cars, i estimate that he should have been going at about 130-150km/h. The road itself is 550m from the start point to the crash site. 220km/h requires a distance of much more to achieve that speed. Even assuming he started at 40-50km/h, it is still extremely difficult to hit 220km/h with that little runway he had. I’ve launched a similar car before and i can tell you first hand that alot of runway is needed even with a 0-100km/h time of 4s (at least 500m)

Nonetheless, they were definitely going way too fast for the road. RIP",t3_lk7r30,16-02-2021

I measured 55m in 1 second. Guy in article probably measured 61. + 2-3m at the start and at the end, very possible to have such a variation, depending on interpretation of the video Vs Gmaps, and also when each individual pauses the video.

More reasonable would be tweaking the internal speed limiters, which are already present on every car but usually set to some ridiculous number like 180 or 200kph. Of course that wouldn't stop someone from just removing the limiter through an ECU flash.

no shit sherlock. but do you know that most revving/speeding cases occur in the wee hours of the morning? if I hear people revving outside my gate, sure i'll go out and have a look. how about ppl living in HDB? you really think they will go all the way down for a glimpse of the license plate? on a side note, if you're able to remember the license plate of modified/speeding cars who whizz past you when you're not looking out for them (which is more often than not the case), then kudos. but not everyone has such a sharp eye.

that's their job. don't listen? fine. wait till accidents occur before they get grilled in parliament for turning a blind eye even tho the problem has been surfaced multiple times.

> SINGAPORE - When they got a call from the Traffic Police about an accident involving their son on Saturday morning, they thought it was a fender bender and he needed bailing out.

> Mr Wilson Teo Qi Xiang, who turned 26 on Dec 29 last year, did not have a driver's licence and was not into fast cars like some of his peers, his father told The Straits Times at their four-room flat in southern Singapore on Monday (Feb 15).

> But when the older Mr Teo saw fire engines at the scene in Tanjong Pagar and heard cries of anguish from those gathered there, he knew the worst had happened.

> Sobbing, the distraught school bus driver recalled how he had nearly collapsed from shock and grief when he learnt that his son died in a horrific crash along with four others. The BMW M4 Coupe they were in had slammed into a vacant shophouse and burst into flames at 5.40am on Feb 13.

> He told ST in Mandarin: ""My heart completely sank. I knew that was it. My son is gone.

> ""I had never thought something like this could happen. I completely broke down. I have lost something that is more important than my own life. I cannot accept it.""

> He and his wife, both 56, as well as their daughter Wileen, 24, remembered the younger Mr Teo as a driven and responsible individual, who was a pillar of support for the family. He was close to his mother and they talked often.

> Mrs Teo, a part-time administrative worker, said: ""He would always tell me if he had any problems.""

> The night before the accident, Mr Teo had promised her that he would not stay out too late as the family had to visit Mrs Teo's father for Chinese New Year the next day. But Mr Teo never came back home after leaving for a friend's place at about 10pm on Friday.

> Mrs Teo said they later found out that he had left the friend's house around midnight.

> ""I told the police, you must have got it wrong. How could he be in that car? He told me he was going to his friend's house. He didn't tell me he was going anywhere else,"" she said as she held back tears.

> ""He was so young. Such a good child and he is just gone like that. He went out one night and he never came back... I keep hoping this is not real. That night, we left our front door open, hoping he would come home and call me 'Mum' once more. If he had come back home, it would have all been fine.""

> Mrs Teo said her son doted on her. He took her to eat hotpot every year for her birthday. ""Last year, I told him I never tried wagyu beef before because it is expensive. He said, I'll take you to eat it.""

> They later went to the Louis Vuitton store and he bought her a $300 pouch. Mrs Teo said: ""I said no, it is too expensive. But he said it was okay, he was earning money.""

> Mr Teo's sister, an undergraduate, said their father, who had worked overseas, was not around when they were growing up so her brother became the father figure.

> 

> The accident site at Tanjong Pagar Road on Feb 13, 2021. PHOTO: ST FILE

> 

> ""He was always very caring towards me. When I was down, he would always tease me to cheer me up. He always said he loved to see my reaction when I am annoyed but I know that it is just his way of showing love,"" she said.

> ""I always saw him as a role model. He wanted to achieve a lot of things in life. He wanted to give my mum a better life. He said he would protect her forever.

> ""I want everybody to remember him as a nice person... He always knew his limits... He was the pillar in my family. There was never a day that I thought he would not be by our side.""

> While he was not the most studious, Mr Teo was street smart, his sister said. His first job after graduating from SIM Global Education with a degree in economics and finance in 2018 was with Aviva Financial Advisers.

> His father said: ""He said he had friends working in the industry so he wanted to join it as he could make money.

> ""He would say that he could buy a car in three years, and buy a flat after another three years. He wanted to learn from them.""

> But Mr Teo had later told his parents he was thinking of switching careers as he felt that the financial advisory industry did not suit him.

> His father said the driver of the BMW, Mr Jonathan Long, 29, was his son's manager. Mr Gary Wong Hong Chieh, Mr Eugene Yap, both 29, and Elvin Tan Yong Hao, 28, who also died in the crash, were colleagues.

> His son would meet them often at a Korean restaurant run by a mutual friend, the father said.

> ST understands that they were frequent customers at Ggang Tong, a Korean eatery just opposite the site of the crash, and were there prior to the incident.

> The group was known to be polite and looked out for the welfare of staff at the eatery.

> Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao quoted Mr Long's friend, who said the BMW was a second-hand car that Mr Long had bought a few months ago for $200,000. In an interview with Shin Min Daily News, Mr Long's family said he was filial and hardworking, while his friends said he was a successful young man and a thoughtful friend.

> Mr Long's father, 62, said the family has been processing the pain of losing a son. He added that Ms Raybe Oh Siew Huey, who is still in a critical condition after suffering 80 per cent burns to her body while trying to save Mr Long, her boyfriend, had also been on their minds. ""I see Raybe as my own daughter.""

> Mr Teo's father said his son never spoke about fast cars and did not show an interest in them.

> He had started taking driving lessons only at his father's behest.

> Mr Teo's remains are still at the morgue, pending identification via a DNA test that was administered on Monday (Feb 15). The older Mr Teo said he was told it would take three days.

> Senior officials from Aviva Financial Advisers had visited the family and offered to hold a wake for Mr Teo, but his father had declined.

> ""My child is gone. Anything that is said or given to us is useless.""

what the MP who has been representing tanjong pagar GRC ***since 2001*** said:
>said on Sunday that complaints she has received in the past related to speeding or racing were mostly in the Cantonment Road vicinity.

>“I think one or two (complaints received) are in this area, meaning Craig Road and Tanjong Pagar Road. The majority of noise complaints I received here were largely of people after hours, drinking, smoking, that kind of associated noise,” 

>Ms Indranee added that she has also not seen an increase in speeding or racing-related complaints in recent days.

so is it coz only got 'one or two complaints in that area' so MP thought is isolated incident, then heck care until got accident happen? 

meanwhile, the residents reportedly pointed out *multiple* incidents of speeding and revving vehicles. 

residents' accounts:
>so frequent that Mr Syed Kassim can, at times, identify the model of the cars based on the sound of the engines alone.

>Mr Chua, said he has seen drivers “trying their luck” and speeding in the wee hours of the morning on weekends

>In the last five years that she has been living in her public housing flat at Block 333 Kreta Ayer Road, which is a five-minute walk from the crash site, the homemaker has witnessed four car crashes in the area.

>Mr Chong, who said the speeding sounds have disrupted his sleep multiple times, pointed to the stretch on Cantonment Road and along Maxwell Food Centre 

why MP say she only receive one or two complaints specific to that area? one can argue that the residents never initiate the complaints to let MP know the situation. but does it also mean that for so many years, the MP never walk the ground enough to find out residents concerns? must wait till shit hits the fan then come up with a bunch of suggestions on how to reduce related incidents in the area?",t3_ljp36x,15-02-2021

> Following the last sighting of a pair of Himalayan Griffon vultures at Bukit Timah, the birdwatchers were alerted to a surprising sighting of them again this week.

> In the early morning of Jan. 9, 2020, a number of Himalayan Griffon vultures have been spotted flying around several places near town.

> S’pore a pitstop for the vultures

> Himalayan Griffon vultures hail, as evident from their name, from the high altitudes of the Himalayas and mountains of Central Asia.

> They are the second-largest Old World vultures found in the continents of Europe, Asia and Africa — their wingspan can reach up to three metres.

> The species is currently classified as “near threatened” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

> The Himalayan Griffon vultures have been spotted during the months of December and January in Singapore in some years, according to Singapore Birds Project.

> These birds are here to find food to refuel and rest as they migrate down to the south during winter.

> As a result of the long flight, the vultures usually arrive weak and hungry.

> Advertisement

> Spotted at many places around Singapore

> The large birds were seen congregating in several areas including Outram Hill, Berlayer Creek, near the Singapore General Hospital, Raffles Place, Bukit Panjang and even Sentosa.

> People in Tanjong Pagar: at least 3 Himalayan Vultures (very rare occasional visitors to Singapore) have been spotted in the vicinity of Orchid Hotel. If you see some really big birds flying high up, it's probably them. Also, be prepared for the crowd of photographers. — Ivan Kwan (@hai_ren) January 9, 2020

> A birdwatcher told Mothership that he believed there were around 12 vultures spotted together at one point.

> The sighting was described by veteran birdwatcher, Francis Yap, as “unprecedented”, as the vultures are rare migrants and for the first time, such a large number of them has been recorded.

> Here’s a really cool shot of the magnificent Himalayan Griffon vulture soaring near the [email protected], taken by Yap.

> At one time, four of the vultures were found roosting in the central business district area.

> A few photos show the large bird roosting atop Orchid Hotel near Tanjong Pagar.

> One person even spotted a vulture wandering along Peck Seah Street towards Maxwell Road on Jan. 8, at around 7pm.

Rather than being just a “conduit for human traffic” as it had originally been intended, academic Brenda S.A. Yeoh suggests that Asians perceived the five-footway in a “more ambivalent light”, such that the space was “sufficiently elastic to allow the co-existence of definitions”. It was precisely this flexibility of use that created the colourful multiplicity of local life found in the five-footways.”

Sometimes I wonder if our void decks could serve more use than it currently does - e.g. some pushcarts to sell food and snacks, electric fans, tables and chairs, to make it more bustling.

> Many would know Rafi Ali as a former national footballer.

> But not as many people know that he also helps out at his family's briyani stall at Tanjong Pagar.

> From Tanjong Pagar Railway Station

> Called Ali Nachia Eating House, the eatery was started by his father in 2002.

> The stall was located at Tanjong Pagar Railway Station before moving to Tanjong Pagar Plaza in 2011 when the railway station closed.

> In January this year, however, it moved to a coffee shop at Hoe Chiang Road.

> In an interview with 8 Days, Rafi revealed that his family was offered to run the entire coffee shop when the master tenant moved out in May this year.

> Now, the coffee shop also serves nasi padang, a stall run by local musician Din Safari and his sister, as well as a teh tarik and kaya toast stall run by Rostam from local band Shagies.

> For a light snack, there is also a stall selling Malay kuehs like goreng pisang.

> Here's a quick look at what they serve:

> Lamb shank briyani dam (S$20)

> They also serve regular mutton briyani (S$8) and chicken briyani (S$7).

> Fish briyani (S$7) is also available only on Fridays.

> Assorted malay kuehs

> Kaya toast, soft-boiled egg and teh tarik

> Nasi padang dishes

> Assorted dishes include sambal sotong and fish asam pedas (sour and spicy gravy).

> They also serve noodles like mee rebus and mee soto.

> Address: 9 Hoe Chiang Road, Singapore 089314

> Opening Hours:

> Mondays to Saturdays, 10:30am - 2:15pm

> Closed on Sundays

imo hardly. gky is still seen as a decent mp and he is pretty active on the grassroots level, even as a minister. also note that he has been mp for cck since it was a smc (2006 to be exact) so he is pretty entrenched on the ground already. gky hasn't drawn as much flak as compared to joteo tbh even though minister of health is most prone to be ""attacked"" in this pandemic situation

the most probable reason for high vote swing is because in 2015 ppp was deemed to be not viable. this year psp sent their team B to cck, and the ge2020 results is actually comparable to ge2011 when nsp contested cck grc and won a decent result of 38.8%. if cck borders remain intact the vote share for pap may have the potential to go down even further in 2025 with the influx of new families settling into the brickland ward (where all the new btos are), seeing the sengkang situation",t3_hp7c3q,11-07-2020

#not good enough
That’s how I'd summarise the reasons for the swing in favour for opposition.

Beyond the extended network of sheltered walkways, quality of life didn't improve much around Bukit Gombak in the last 5-10 years. It's simply not as vibrant as it should be, given the age of the estate. (It started developing around 35 years ago.)",t3_hp7c3q,11-07-2020

1. TCB effect. Definitely help legitimize the candidates as good
2. Newcomer effect and the loss of a well-recognised MP. It seems that Zaqy is considered fairly well-known and has decent favourability ratings. Bringing in 2 newcomers and losing Zaqy means that net recognition and favourability of the PAP team is lower(newcomers have neutral favourability and neutral/limited recognition). This is a little similar to the Sengkang situation, where the PAP candidates had neutral recognition and neutral favourability. Lam Pin Min had higher recognition, but low favourability. In contrast, Amrin Amin, had positive favourability but lower recognition (given he was from Sembawang GRC). For WP, Jamus had high favourability and high recognition, and Raeesah had high recognition and going by trends, slightly positive favourability. 
3. Nanyang replaced by Brickland. TCB did mention that PSP didnt do as well in Nanyang (now West Coast GRC). I presume that he lost Nanyang ward by a little. Given that the PSP candidates are not TCB, I suspect that Nanyang is a fairly safe PAP ward previously (around the national average of 61% at least).

> SINGAPORE: Flash floods were reported in the western and central parts of Singapore following a heavy downpour on Wednesday (Jan 24) afternoon.

> National water agency PUB said in separate alerts on Wednesday that flash floods occurred at Jalan Boon Lay/International Road at 5.15pm and Craig Road at 5.16pm.

> Flash flood at Jln Boon Lay/International Road. 2 out of 3 lanes are affected. Avoid the area. Issued 17:15 hours. [#sgflood](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sgflood?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

> In an update late on Wednesday, PUB noted that the two areas are known flood hotspots.

> ""There are plans for drainage improvement works at Jalan Boon Lay/International Road in tandem with upcoming development works in the area. PUB is studying measures to improve the drainage at Craig Road,"" it said in a statement.

> Video sent by Channel NewsAsia reader Daeun Amy Yoo showed the wheels of vehicles partially submerged in the flash flood, with water rising up to ankle level at Tanjong Pagar Road. 

> Photos sent in by another Channel NewsAsia reader, who wanted to remain anonymous, showed Outram Road covered in muddy water.

> Barriers from a nearby construction looked to have dislodged from their positions and floated onto the middle lane of the road, obstructing vehicles.

> The Tanjong Pagar slate will be helmed by Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Indranee Rajah, one-term backbencher Joan Pereira and new candidates former civil servant Eric Chua and LinkedIn senior executive Alvin Tan.

> 

> Absent from PAP's Tanjong Pagar and Radin Mas 2015 slate respectively are two-term backbencher Chia Shi-Lu and Minister of State for Social and Family Development and Foreign Affairs Sam Tan.

> 

> Dr Chia, who is in his late 40s, was drafted in from the PAP's reserve list at the eleventh hour for the 2011 election, after potential Tampines candidate Steve Tan withdrew and had to be replaced by now Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Transport and Culture, Community and Youth Baey Yam Keng. The PAP won in Tanjong Pagar with a walkover that year.

> In 2015, the PAP ran against the Singaporeans First party in Tanjong Pagar and won with 78 per cent of the vote.

> Mr Sam Tan, 61, also started his political career in Tanjong Pagar with a walkover in 2006. In 2011, his ward was carved out as Radin Mas SMC. Mr Tan ran against the National Solidarity Party in 2011 and the Reform Party as well as an independent candidate in 2015, winning both times with 67 per cent and 77 per cent of the vote, respectively.

> 

> Dr Chia's replacement Eric Chua, 41, was a director of the SGSecure Programme Office. He has been a community volunteer for 15 years, and was previously chairman of the People's Association Youth Movement's Central Youth Council and chairman of grassroots committees.

> Mr Chua said during his candidate introduction that he wanted to ensure youths, especially those from humble family backgrounds, have a ""fair chance"" to succeed in life.

> Mr Yong's replacement is Mr Alvin Tan, 39, head of public policy and economics at technology firm LinkedIn. Mr Tan started volunteering at Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng in 2005 and at Moulmein-Cairnhill since 2019.

> His focus areas include digitisation, ""preserving and protecting"" racial and religious harmony in Singapore, and green and sustainability issues.

> 

> Tanjong Pagar is considered a PAP stronghold, with former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew running there in every election from 1955 to 2011.

> This year, former PAP Member of Parliament Tan Cheng Bock's Progress Singapore Party is expected to contest Tanjong Pagar, with rumours that it could field Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's brother Lee Hsien Yang there. The party has not said if Mr Lee Hsien Yang will stand in the election.

> Mr Chan Chun Sing said on Friday that the PAP welcomes ""other people to come and stand"", when asked about the possibility of Mr Lee Hsien Yang running in Tanjong Pagar.

> ""It offers Tanjong Pagar residents a choice,"" he added.

> ""So, we are not particularly focused on who is coming or going. From the PAP team's perspective, we are focused on serving our residents day in, day out, and we have been doing that for the last many years.""

>""(These plans) are meant to demonstrate to the electorate that this is what good leadership looks like, thinking ahead for the mid and long-term,"" said Dr Mustafa.

This statement implies a few assumptions: (1) the incumbent expects to retain their power in these areas, so that their plans can be carried out, and (2) the opposition doesn't have adequate power to build/improve infrastructure for their residents if they get elected (and partly because they have no such five-year plans), and (3) if the opposition does win, the residents will have no chance to enjoy these infrastructure.

The third assumption is especially glaring, because imo, plans to improve lifestyles/infrastructure of Singaporeans should never be abandoned just because the plans were made by a different party.
