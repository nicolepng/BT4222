The optics of [yelling at then PM GCT](https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/sdp-leader-chee-soon-juan-shows-gentler-side-return-political-stage) to clarify on the foreign policy issue with the loudhailer is bad. I would argue that CSJ's antics (e.g Tak Boleh Tahan) in his early years was done to raise awareness of issues -among which, was *that* foreign policy issue ([which the WSJ had covered](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1004650215973399640))- he thought was important and that was not being covered in the media and thus hoped to effect policy changes through such means.  He was banking on people reading the news of his antics which hopefully including the policy changes that he was advocating for. The reports almost always excluded that, thus highlighting the failure of this approach.

(P.S the [court documents](https://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/docs/default-source/module-document/judgement/2003-sghc-79.pdf) of the appeal of GCT v CST makes for good reading.)

However, people seem to forget that this was an era before social media, where SPH ruled the airwaves. The fact that we got the speakers corner was partly due to him which also showed the success, albeit limited, that this approach brought. 

Nowadays, all CSJ has to do now is to post on his social media accounts and some alternative media would carry it and get his message into the mainstream.

I believe than CSJ is a liar and a fraud with a matyr complex. I think at this point, the evidence is overwhelming, and anyone who still buys into his self-narrated ""redemption arc"" is being too naive. I also believe Chiam is an honest, compassionate MP. It's hard to quantify the performance of non-office holders since they don't create policies, but most Potong Pasir residents agree. You may disagree, as is your right, but I think there is obviously no serious shortage of honest and competent opposition aspirants in Singapore right now, and giving credence to this man only retards the momentum that people like LTK, Sylvia Lim, Pritam, and yes, Chiam have worked hard to create.",t3_ki2wmp,22-12-2020

Anyways, I never said that CSJ is the perfect politician and that he is godsent. I'm not a CSJ sycophant. 

Yep, 2009, that was when social media was starting to grow and assert its presence both locally and globally.  Do I agree with what CSJ did then? Nope, in fact, I cringed when I watched that video for the first time and I knew that the ""foreign influence"" tag would soon be thrown at him. But this, in fact, this highlights why he is not partisan for partisan sake, but because his fight is ideological.

I would like to shed some context, though:  Obama's historic elevation to the presidency promised a progressive democratic socialist era in America; he ran on such ideals, although, he turned out to be a corporatist. 

These ideals are based on a global democratic-socialist ideology that is shared by many democratic socialists groups nowadays such as Momentum and Our Revolution. CSJ is a democratic socialist; in the same vein as many of the founding PAP members were (where it includes democratic ideals such as freedom of speech and expression). However, being Amerian-educated, he did not contextualise such ideals to be platable towards Singaporeans.

An extremely large number of Singaporeans, like me, were born in an LKY Singapore where such freedoms were non-existent, and we lived with it. To try to fight for unfettered freedom in such domains is not the right way, and even LHL alluded to this in his NDR [speech](https://www.webcitation.org/5suddsd1N?url=http://www.news.gov.sg/public/sgpc/en/media_releases/agencies/mica/transcript/T-20080819-2.html) in 2008.

This is why SDP had initially said that 377A was not compatible and had to be removed (purely ideological; freedom to love). Heck, they even ran Dr Wijeysingha and got disgustingly attacked by [Vivian Balakrishan](https://the-singapore-lgbt-encyclopaedia.wikia.org/wiki/Vivian_Balakrishnan_attacks_Vincent_Wijeysingha_for_having_alleged_gay_agenda_during_2011_General_Elections) for it. Nowadays their ideological tent is big enough to fit in people like Damanhuri Abas who is a [social conservative](https://yawningbread.wordpress.com/2015/09/04/the-choice-between-wear-white-and-those-dressed-in-white/).

Then again, you need people like CSJ and the SDP and a bit of that ""confrontational style"" to push Singaporean's out of their comfort zone in order to expand the Overton window, something which [Jamus also mentioned](https://youtu.be/pSVyBO2sV5w?t=75) when asked about him.

In short, international solidary for progressive change does not work in Singapore, period. The days of the early '60s where ""[foreign influence](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mr-lee-kuan-yew-had-close-ties-with-britain-but-was-never-a-colonial-nostalgic)"" was an option are long gone.",t3_ki2wmp,22-12-2020

A man of poorer character also wouldn't have chosen to remain here and be subjected to prosecution and constant demonization by the media (pre-internet era) after the incident those years back.

I'm also sceptical of the false dichotomy you presented - I believe both Chee and Chiam to be upstanding leaders but with different ideas as to how best the party should be managed. Why else would Chiam be ousted by so many of his party members otherwise if he'd maintained good relations with them? How did the SDP of today manage to recruit capable individuals with the likes of Dr Paul Tambyah?

I empathize with with the constituents of Potong Pasir truly but I fail to see how we can objectively measure the performance of present-day SDP if they're not given the opportunity to hold any wards in the first place.

Second article is just him flaming the PAP non-stop in a party political, even saying they're out of touch because of their salary. I can't see how that is an example of him praising the PAP.

Third interview is 55 min long, I've watched it before, but it would be more useful to show me a timestamp from approx. where he praised a single government policy, if you don't mind.

I appreciate your political analysis. At the same time, the question is has CSJ genuinely shown himself to even be capable of bipartisanship in recent years. I've yet to see an example. To give a counterpoint, in the recent debate with Jamus Lim and Vivian, rather than answer questions about the fiscal feasibility of his policy proposals, he went on a tirade against the PAP, attack everything under the sun including, but not limited to ministerial salaries, and the YOG budget 10 years ago.

With regards to your point about the debate, I mean, watch it again carefully. Vivian came into that debate and immediately set the ideological standard; the PAP is ok with WP and even the PSP. But we are totally against whatever the SDP stands for. Vivian had hoped that by doing so, Singapore's ideological standard would be on par with the PAP's; many academics have written about the need for the ruling party to push the narrative of Singapore=PAP for their electoral success to be entrenched.

That CSJ brought up the YOG budget, I mentioned it before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hjgvhl/cnas_first_election_debate_my_take/fwnap7q?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The point was that Vivian was trying to portray that SDP was a fiscally irresponsible party in terms of their policies (4Y1N).

> ""The remains of a person was found inside the unit,"" said police, adding that they do not suspect foul play. Investigations are ongoing.

> Replying to CNA's queries, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said its officers entered the flat ""to conduct urgent dengue inspections"" after multiple unsuccessful attempts to contact the owner or occupier of the flat.

> The flat is located in an active dengue cluster area with 178 cases, said NEA.

> Singapore is facing its worst outbreak of dengue cases. As of Monday, more than 14,000 dengue cases have been reported this year. The total number of cases this year is expected to exceed the 22,170 cases reported in 2013, the largest dengue outbreak in Singapore’s history.

> Last month, NEA announced it will impose stiffer penalties for households with repeated mosquito breeding offences and multiple breeding habitats. It will also tighten enforcement for construction sites and town councils.

> In cases where urgent vector control measures are needed, NEA will issue a legal notice to residents requiring them to open up their premises for inspection at a specified date and time.

> Entry by force may be used if the premises remain inaccessible or are vacant.

> Locksmith Mr Tan Meng Kee, 51, told CNA that he was engaged by NEA to help open the door of the flat.

> The body was in the kitchen, said Mr Tan, adding that he could not tell if it was a man or woman because the body had already ""became (a) skeleton"".

> The windows of the unit were open and there ""no smell at all"", he added.

172,13,ee8qgi5,t3_agsmuk,"SINGAPORE - Potong Pasir residents who have had their beauty sleep disrupted by the cacophony of mynahs squawking can rest more soundly now.

The number of Javan mynahs - a non-native, invasive bird species - has dwindled from 2,800 as of the end of December to about 300 as of Tuesday night (Jan 15), Potong Pasir MP Sitoh Yih Pin told The Straits Times.

While the noise is not completely eradicated, the reduction is a welcome respite.

Since January last year, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) has received 20 complaints from Potong Pasir residents about the mynahs that, in large numbers, poses a threat to native bird species when they compete for nesting and food resources.

In response, Mr Sitoh filed three questions in Parliament, including the latest on Monday.

After several rounds of trials and tests that had varying levels of success, the AVA, National Parks Board and Jalan Besar Town Council appear to have found a solution.

About 300 trees in the neighbourhood that the mynahs roost on are being pruned in stages, to nudge the birds to fly to trees in a ""more uninhabited spot"" further from residential areas, Mr Sitoh said.

""Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would one day be directing the flight path of birds,"" quipped the MP, an accountant by training.

""A lot of progress has been made,"" he added. ""For one, not as many mynahs are hanging at the trees in the horseshoe-shaped carpark (at Block 145 Potong Pasir), which tended to amplify the sound.""

Coffee shop assistant Ong Tong Chye, 61, said he has seen fewer birds at the coffee shop at Block 146 compared to before.

But business analyst Evelyn Chee, 36, said the mynahs have been a problem since last year, but the disturbance caused by the birds has been more apparent recently.

She added that the mynahs have moved to the other side of Block 145 after the trees on one side were pruned.

Asked about this, Mr Sitoh noted that some of the trees were only pruned on Wednesday.

""If all goes well the birds will eventually settle down in an uninhabited area,"" he said, adding that he hopes all the mynahs will be permanently ""moved"" within the next two months.

Last month, the AVA had tested a ""roost net"" on a sea apple tree in Potong Pasir Avenue 2 - a giant covering placed over a tree that allows birds to enter and roost on the tree, but prevents them from coming out. The trapped birds were later euthanised.

In a written response on Monday, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said the AVA is fine-tuning the method before considering wider development.

Besides pruning the trees and expecting the mynahs to disperse to non-residential areas, Mr Wong added that a second, longer-term measure is to replace the current roost trees with tree types that are less preferred by the mynahs.

""These are trees with crowns that are less dense, but will still provide greenery and shade,"" he said.

He added that the public must also keep their environment clean and not feed the birds.",t3_agsmuk,17-01-2019

> A body was found in a Potong Pasir flat on July 2 while National Environment Agency (NEA) officers were conducting dengue inspections.

> Forced entry by NEA officers

> CNA reported that the flat is located in an active dengue cluster area with 178 cases.

> NEA officers had entered the flat after unsuccessful attempts to contact the owner or occupier.

> According to NEA's official website, forced entry may be used if the premises remain inaccessible or are vacant, to ensure that any mosquito breeding habitats are found and destroyed.

> Hence, a locksmith was engaged by NEA to help open the door, reported CNA. The locksmith told CNA that the body was found in the kitchen.

> However, he could not tell if it was a man or woman, as the body had already decomposed, and said it ""became (a) skeleton.""

> He added that the windows of the flat were open and there was ""no smell"".

> Police do not suspect foul play

> Responding to queries from Mothership, the police said that at 3:51pm on Thursday (July 2), they were alerted to a case of unnatural death at a residential unit at 139 Potong Pasir Avenue 3.

> The remains of a person were found inside the unit. However, police added that they do not suspect foul play.

> Investigations are ongoing.
