0,27,f6dzvup,t3_dr0qso,I kinda thought Woodlands used to be dense jungle before development. Or at least part of the western swamp. Was it ever either?,t3_dr0qso,03-11-2019

4,27,f6e1qcs,t1_f6dzvup,"Not sure of true untouched jungles in Woodlands (except the Sungei Cina area), but:

It had gambier plantations that were increasingly cleared for rubber plantations by the 1920s. In fact, much of the north had rubber estates pre-HDB.

Maps show that the area around SSDC was Tay Keng Loon estate, while around Admiralty was Mok Peng Hiang estate. But these rubber plantations were abandoned at some point, and became the place you see in the picture above.

But from far, even rubber plantations look like jungles, given time.",t3_dr0qso,03-11-2019

16,27,e7r3m4j,t3_9o1a8i,There's a gym in Yishun called OwlGym. It's a 24 hours gym for members but only 12pm to 10pm for walk ins at $8 per entry. Their 1 year membership costs $720 which is like $60/month. The gym is pretty small but the fact that it's not very packed at all times of the day kinda compensates for it. Equipment is pretty good. ,t3_9o1a8i,14-10-2018

Don't seem like they have a rack for Bench/Squat, only a smith.

22,27,e7r06kf,t1_e7qspnf,"Hi, the location seems good, but I've some questions since you're involved in the club so I'd like to take the opportunity to clarify.

1)  What exactly are the differences between the different types of membership it offers. In particular, the Ordinary vs Social Memberships? The social one is the only one that seems affordable, and so I'm wondering if I'm allowed access to the gym there with that membership.

2) Is it weird that I become part of the club just to gym lol. Always felt like it's a high SES type of club lol.

3) The pictures of the gym shows a benchpress, but is there squat racks and bars for deadlifting?

&#x200B;

Thanks!",t3_9o1a8i,14-10-2018

Hi! I'll reply you here since there are some things not meant to be shared publicly.

First of all, its my dad who got the membership, I didn't. Security is really lax there and he brings me along at times. Only at the guardhouse, they will ask to see your membership card. [[Continued...]](https://www.resavr.com/comment/gym-recommendations-for-north-11161703)
