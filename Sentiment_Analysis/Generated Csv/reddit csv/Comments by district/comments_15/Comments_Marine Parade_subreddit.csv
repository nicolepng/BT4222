I would argue their contemporary differences is due to their roles as competitors where for decades in recent memory all three countries operated an export oriented manufacturing economy (Japan earlier than others) where they were in direct competition. However that is drawing its last breath in Korea, and fading fast dramatically in China with a collapsed population pyramid. 


A consumption and service driven economy will the only way forward for them while juggling rapidly shrinking populations. To sustain this they will need to form greater access in markets. This is not even considering the possibility of increased isolationism in America.


China's authoritarian regime can definitely represent a conservative entrenched interest against this (think of the SOE's that would face even greater competition) but I think that is quite overrated.

I'm not saying it will happen over night because it change never happens so fast, but the trends are there and there will be no other way. The EU was hardly formed out of some kind of pan-European idealism, it was the pragmatic way forward as are the trends here. 


I think its rather short sighted to overweight the current status quo over trends in determining the world tomorrow, because until its dismantlement the Soviet union appeared to be impregnable, before its rise the United States seemed like a backwater colony, and before its collapse the British empire seemed like it would never end.

To just refer to a camera, South Korean will often use 키메라, despite the Korean word 사진기 existing (and still used in some contexts). 

Most of the issues of translating between the two are connected to loan words, less so than the actual Korean, although issues like the South changing words like 녀자/녀름 to 여자/여름 while the north left them alone do add to this.",t3_f8pgf8,25-02-2020

I am not saying an eu like organization for East Asia won’t happen in the future, because like what you said anything can happen in the future.

I just think that having a strong economic relationship doesn’t mean that the overall political relationship would be good. Taiwan and China has a lot of economic interaction also, but the relationship is always kind of strained.

104,15,g02p0mr,t3_i29dwf,"**Hi,**

I just wanted to give an update on the Vintage Comic Stall at Marine Parade Central Market & Food Centre

We went there to purchase a bunch of comic books to add to our collection and help out the owners. We were luckily to not only meet the owner but also his very friendly and helpful daughter.

Aunty wanted to say that the timing of the stall opening is not fixed as it depends on when uncle feels like coming down to open the store.

I decided to take photos of the surrounding stalls to make it easier to find as it took us a while to find the stall. Easiest tip is that it’s opposite the Taste of Vegetarian stall. It is inside the hawker centre itself (I thought it would be outside with the other stalls/stores).

Aunty also gave a helpful tip for parking for those who are not familiar with the area like us. Parking at the market is almost impossible especially on weekends. She said it’s better to park at the parking lot near Marine Parade Polyclinic (Blk 77A Carpark) as it is spacious and sheltered. It’s about 5 minutes walk to the comic book stall.

She also had tips in terms of the comic books. You can literally take hours there just browsing and digging through the multitude of comic books they have.

\> Series (for example Batman Mud Pack 4-part series - we managed to find part 3 & 4 and there are still some left there)

\> Millennium Week Series (managed to find Batman and Flash versions)

\> tons of Annual series (like normal Annuals or cooler ones like the Atlantis Attacks series)

\> cool finds also include cross-overs

One can start browsing through their favourite characters first to not get too overwhelmed. They have already grouped them accordingly. You can also tell them what your favourite character is and they will show you all the comic books they have for it. I started with Flash and aunty took them out and hung it all in one place so that it’s easier for me to browse.

Then pile up the ones you are considering on one side first. So that if others come, they can start browsing the ones you weren’t interested in as well especially if you’re looking at popular characters like Batman.

Last but not the least, please remember to maintain social distancing. The stall has a limited space. If there’s already someone browsing in the front, you can ask to browse the characters you are looking for at the side of the stall where the other comic books like Archie/Care Bears are placed as shown in one of the images I took.

Last tip, bring wet wipes and sanitizer. Please sanitize your hands before browsing so we can maintain safety especially for uncle and aunty who will have to pack the comic books once you are done browsing or upon closing. Wet wipes is for after as these are vintage, your hands might feel dusty afterwards.

Hope more people reaches this and help them out. 3 for $10 is really a great deal. These comic books are gems. The owners who manage the stall are also great and friendly people. Let’s support them and at the same time enjoy the nostalgic novelty of reading comic books again!",t3_i29dwf,02-08-2020

People also tend to ignore the fact that GRCs are set up in such a way that the bar for entry is raised significantly for the competition and is skewed heavily in favour of the incumbent. The whole ""minority representation"" schtick is a poor excuse, and has the heavily implication that voters are a bunch of racists. If anything, unhappiness with govt policies is a potent tool for racial unity (Anson By-election, anyone?)",t3_fic3pl,14-03-2020
264,15,fkjdxdf,t1_fkh3wgq,"I personally think the GRC system allows a party to build a team with people of complementary skill sets which can serve their constituents better. One person can work the ground perhaps, another with great town council management skills, one with financial expertise etc. I much prefer it over having to entrust an area to a single individual who isn’t well rounded enough.

We are land-poor but talent rich. Why not have a different system of representation compared to other countries? We set up every aspect of our society to maximize our advantages and minimize our weaknesses. Why not governance and representation as well?",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
265,15,fkjf7h2,t1_fkjdxdf,"They're both sides of the same coin, inho. And while it does sound good on paper, the current practice is for MPs to be allocated certain neighbourhoods/precincts that they're in charge of, which is not much different from that of running a SMC. It is also quite hard for MPs to cover overlapping areas to ensure well-rounded support for the people, as a single neighbourhood alone consists of multiple families, let alone trying to canvas multiple neighbourhoods at once.

There's also the thorny issue of GRCs being used to ""parachute"" (allegedly) otherwise unelectable newcomers into parliament. Take Dr Koh Poh Koon, for instance. Despite being hailed as the son of Punggol, he did not run again for Punggol East SMC in GE2015. Rather, he campaigned under the AMK GRC team instead, where it was arguably easier to gain admittance into Parliament as compared to campaigning alone in a SMC.

It is therefore my opinion that the concept of GRCs should be relooked at and perhaps amended to be more democratic.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
266,15,fkjhrij,t1_fkjf7h2,"Funny how I look at those aspects as positives rather than negatives. Being able to divide and coalesce responsibilities where appropriate - that’s the strength of group representation. Obviously some tasks are better tackled individually, and some tasks are better tackled collectively. That’s efficiency and we’re bloody efficient if nothing else.

The GRC system being able to bring in high potential but low experience representatives is also a fantastic strength. That’s how we groom young executives in large corporations - bring them into a team to work on big projects they otherwise could never get exposure to on their own, get them to learn from experienced mentors, and eventually fulfill their potential. It’s a fantastic system, compared to young hopefuls being thrust into SMCs with no experience or guidance. Again, it’s efficient, proven and similar to methods employed by tons of extremely successful organizations.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020
267,15,fkjj7sp,t1_fkjhrij,"And herein lies the rub. The system benefits incumbents greatly, while simultaneously raising the bar for any team willing to mount a challenge. No offense, but the way you're looking at it reminds me of the mindset of a business executive. Sure, what you're proposing is great from an organisational standpoint, but from a democratic point of view, it is deeply flawed. If we're truly about electing the best team for the job, why is there a huge divide in requirements for both sides? Sure, one could argue that the incoming party would have to prove themselves first and that some measure of safeguards have to be in place. But the current playing field is so skewed that it might as well be a one-sided game of chess.

And last I checked, we're still a democracy, not a one-party centralised dictatorship like China.",t3_fic3pl,15-03-2020

> It also said that it would work with the Cat Welfare Society (CWS) and Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority to educate its staff and pest control operators on proper management of animal-related issues.

> Their remarks come after reports circulating on social media that two cats from the area had gone missing after being caught and ""dumped"" at Harbourfront by the town council.

> The cats, Ben Ben and Leng Leng, were caught at Marine Terrace and subsequently dumped at the Seah Im Food Center earlier this month, Facebook user Snowy Tan said in a post on Wednesday.

> One of the cats was later found dead at Harbourfront, the post added. The whereabouts of the other cat is unknown.

> ""Marine Parade Town Council (MPTC), with their pest control company, trapped cats and cruelly dumped them in an area with no easy access to food and with dangerously high traffic,"" said Snowy Tan.

> ""The cats were dumped miles away from their home and no idea how to get home,"" the post added.

> In their response on Thursday, the town council said that residents have made more than 45 reports since 2016 about the cats causing nuisance.

> ""The cats, around 15 of them, were left roaming freely within the block, causing disamenities and hygiene issues such as cats defecating/urinating, fur shedding, caterwauling, etc, at the common corridor, staircases and lift lobbies,"" said the town council. ""The cat-related nuisances were reported from most levels of the block and the surrounding blocks too.""

> The town council added that it has engaged with a Mdm Tan ""on many occasions to advise against keeping so many cats in her HDB flat, and not to allow the cats to roam freely at the common areas of the block, affecting many residents"", said the town council.

> ""However, there was no improvement.""

> It also said that the CWS is aware of the situation and assisting to educate Mdm Tan on responsible pet ownership.

- really affectionate with people and followed me really far
- she let us pet her the whole time while she was eating and was not afraid of us at all
- **the foreign helpers around the area said they only recently saw this cat recently**
- she accepted food from a neighbours house

> SINGAPORE: The body of a 65-year-old man was found in his flat at Block 30, Marine Crescent on Tuesday (Jan 9).

> The Singapore Police Force said they received a call for assistance at 9.20pm, adding that the man was found lying motionless and was pronounced dead by paramedics.

> Channel NewsAsia understands that the body was decomposed. ""It was subsequently established that he had died of natural causes,"" police stated.

> Next-door neighbour Mr Ng, who had not seen the deceased for about a week, realised something was amiss on Monday night and raised the alarm.

>        Mr Ng said the man had been living in the unit for at least 10 years. (Photo: Aqil Haziq Mahmud)   

> ""It was Monday, just past midnight,"" said Mr Ng on Wednesday, adding that his neighbour lived alone with a dog. ""I was coming back. The dog barked at me as usual, but I never thought of anything.""

> The next morning, the 60-year-old retiree decided to give his neighbour a call as they had not seen each other for a week or so. 

> ""That was the first time that I reached the voicemail,"" he added. ""He was a guy who would call me back, no matter how.""

> When Mr Ng called again in the afternoon, he got voicemail again. ""I was thinking, something is really wrong,"" he said. When he tried knocking on the door, the dog barked at him again.

> That was unusual, Mr Ng said. His neighbour would always be with his dog in his room with the air-conditioning on, he said, so it was impossible that the pet would be out in the living room for so long.

> It was then that Mr Ng decided to call the man&apos;s sister. Family members called the police, who gained access to the house with the help of a locksmith, he said.

> ""They didn’t want to damage anything in case he was hospitalised or went somewhere without informing anybody,"" Mr Ng said. ""But the first thing they saw was him lying on the floor near the door.""

>        The man&apos;s gate was padlocked. (Photo: Aqil Haziq Mahmud)   

> UNDERSTANDING, HELPFUL ANIMAL LOVER

> Mr Ng said he had hoped that nothing bad had happened to his neighbour. ""(I thought) maybe he went on a holiday,"" he added.

> Mr Ng also wondered why his neighbour did not knock on his door if he was feeling unwell.

> ""Once in a while, if he had problems, he also knocked on my door,"" Mr Ng said. ""Why not this time?""

>        Potted plants outside the man&apos;s home had withered. (Photo: Aqil Haziq Mahmud)   

> ""This kind of thing should not happen,"" added Mr Ng, who said he understood his neighbour used to work as a chief steward with Singapore Airlines. 

> ""He was still young. He just retired half a year ago.""

> Mr Ng said they were good friends and would even share leftover meals.

> ""You see, he’s really understanding,"" he told Channel NewsAsia. ""He likes to help people. If you&apos;re not sure about anything, he will explain it to you.""

> Mr Ng also described his neighbour as a ""great"" animal lover who would feed every stray cat in the neighbourhood for ""breakfast, lunch and dinner"".

> ""If he was still alive, he’d still be feeding them,"" he added.

> Two weeks ago, the decomposed body of a 68-year-old man was [found](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/decomposed-body-found-in-punggol-flat-9816288) in a Punggol flat.

The office/pantry/research and store rooms can be easily replicated in another space, not the theatre; they will need a big, specialised space that can be reconfigured into the theatre, with specialised lights, speakers, seats, acoustic treatment, etc

In addition, The Necessary Stage has been doing a lot for the community: they've held workshops, have programmes for the community's youth and seniors, etc. To suddenly be told that they're losing their home (and hence, the community) means a complete reworking of their community programmes, since they are not likely to be in Marine Parade anymore. Depending on how far they are from the CC, this might mean they either fold their existing community programmes, or they have to restart from scratch

we all know that singapore is run very much on capitalist principles (which i do not like, but this is how it is at the moment, unfortunately. if we want change... you know what you have to do!). assuming (someone correct me if i am wrong) that the PA and The Necessary Stage have a normal landlord-tenant relationship, and that there was a lease agreement between the two, then a year's notice for _any_ tenant is objectively a very long time. this is just a case of PA declaring that they are not going to extend/renew the lease when it expires in August 2021, right? this is just now it works in any landlord-tenant relationship. the landlord has no obligation to extend a lease when it expires. (so why did i bring in the capitalist part? because in some countries, there are laws that protect tenants in some situations, which we do not have in singapore because the government prefers to advantage big business/landlords)

i would ask why TNS felt comfortable to organise events/activities into 2023 (as someone else mentioned) if they knew that their lease would expire in August 2021!",t3_huyooy,21-07-2020

492,15,fyr0pox,t1_fyqj4wm,"I'm the one who flagged that they had plans for up to 2023, and I agree with your paragraph on Singapore being very capitalistic. 

As for why TNS made plans for up to 2023, it could be because NAC's funding cycles run for 3 years (for Major Companies, which TNS falls under). This means that when they submit proposals for the grants, they have to detail plans and budgets for programmes that they will be conducting or staging for the entire 3-year cycle, which would then be used to determine their KPIs. In other words, they may have, to some extent, been ""locked in"" to certain commitments.

Like I mentioned above, theatre works can have long incubation periods of more than one year so that also needs to be factored into the planning cycle for the company.

Having been a resident at the CC for 20 years, I don't think they would have expected to been kicked out so abruptly either. It's like the frustrating feeling of: 明明好好的，为什么突然被赶出去？ (trans: Everything has been fine all along, why am I suddenly being chased out?)

Even if there is no obligation on the landlord's part to renew the agreement, the last thing on a theatre company's mind would be ""my lease is expiring next year"", especially when the priority now is to stay afloat, especially since the arts have been especially badly hit by COVID.

Meanwhile, the Town Council has not only established themselves as cat killers but also serial liars. How stupid can they be to have so many major ""miscommunication issues""?

I'd like to see the Town Council investigated for animal cruelty and mishandling, and those irresponsible cat owners for pet abandonment. Unfortunately I suspect that they will all get away scot-free at the expense of a heart-broken woman and innocent cat and this makes me really upset.
